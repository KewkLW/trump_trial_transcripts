## Core Issues

The core issue is whether Donald J. Trump falsified business records with the intent to defraud and conceal another crime, specifically a conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election.

## Facts of the Case

The case revolves around a series of payments made by Michael Cohen to individuals, including Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, to suppress negative information about Trump during the 2016 presidential election. These payments were allegedly made at Trump's direction and were then disguised as legal expenses in the Trump Organization's business records. The prosecution argues that these falsified records were part of a larger scheme to conceal a criminal conspiracy.

The prosecution lays out the following key events:

* **August 2015:** Trump, David Pecker (CEO of AMI, which owned the National Enquirer), and Michael Cohen meet at Trump Tower to discuss a plan to influence the 2016 election.
* **2015-2016:** The trio engages in "catch and kill" tactics, buying stories that could be damaging to Trump's campaign and suppressing their publication. 
* **October 2016:** The Washington Post publishes the "Access Hollywood" tape, containing Trump's comments about sexual assault.
* **October 2016:** Cohen pays Stormy Daniels $130,000 to prevent her from disclosing an alleged affair with Trump.
* **January 2017:** Trump repays Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment through a series of monthly payments disguised as legal expenses.

## Legal Arguments

**Prosecution:**

* Trump's actions constitute falsifying business records with the intent to defraud and conceal another crime.
* The payments to individuals like Stormy Daniels were made to influence the election and were illegal.
* The falsified records were part of a coordinated conspiracy to deceive the public and protect Trump's campaign.

**Defense:**

* Trump is innocent and did not commit any crimes.
* The payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal services.
* The records were accurately reflected in the ledger and the information was recorded by employees without Trump's knowledge or involvement.
* Trump had no intent to commit a crime.
* Entering into a non-disclosure agreement is legal.
* The prosecution's case is based on unreliable witnesses, particularly Michael Cohen, who is driven by an obsession with Trump and a desire to see him in prison.

## Rulings and Decisions

* **Juror Number Nine:** The court addressed the juror's concerns about media attention and safety. The juror is allowed to remain on the jury.
* **Limiting Instructions:** The court provided a limiting instruction regarding Michael Cohen's guilty plea and ruled on the admissibility of transcripts summarizing the "Access Hollywood" tape.
* **Sandoval Hearing:** The court ruled on the scope of cross-examination regarding Trump's prior misconduct and criminal acts, allowing the prosecution to inquire into specific proceedings but limiting the extent of inquiry into underlying facts and details.

## Reasoning

The court's rulings, particularly regarding the Sandoval hearing, reflect the need to balance the prosecution's right to impeach a defendant's credibility with the defendant's right to a fair trial. The court sought to ensure that the use of prior misconduct does not unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant. 

## Significant Quotes

* **Prosecution:** "This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up."
* **Defense:** "President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes."
* **Judge Merchan:** "A fair juror must guard against the impact of such stereotypes or attitudes." 
* **Michael Cohen:** (according to the defense) "He called President Trump, just last night, a despicable human being, among other things. And he said that he wanted to see President Trump in an orange jumpsuit."

## Outcomes and Implications

The case is still ongoing.  The outcome will determine whether Trump is found guilty of falsifying business records and whether he is held accountable for the alleged conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.

The case has broader implications beyond Trump himself. It highlights the potential for abuse of power by politicians, the complexities of campaign finance law, and the challenges of maintaining public trust in government. The outcome of the trial could set a precedent for future cases involving similar allegations of campaign finance violations and election interference.

* **Attorneys for the Defendant:** Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, Kendra Wharton
* **Judge:** Honorable Juan M. Merchan

## Core Issues:

* Whether Donald J. Trump violated the Gag Order issued by the court on three occasions in April 2024, and seven other occasions in April 2024.
* Whether the defendant's actions constitute contempt of court.
* The interpretation and application of the Gag Order, specifically the "political attacks" exception.
* The admissibility of certain exhibits, particularly regarding texts and emails as business records, and statements made by Stephen Bannon.

## Facts of the Case:

* The court issued a Gag Order on March 26, 2024, restricting extrajudicial statements by the defendant.
* This order was amended on April 1st, 2024, due to the defendant's attacks on family members.

* The defendant claims that his actions were in response to political attacks by witnesses and were protected by the "political attacks" exception in the Gag Order.
* The defendant argues that reposts of news articles should not be considered violations of the Gag Order.

## Legal Arguments:

**People's Arguments:**

* The Gag Order is a lawful order, and the defendant knowingly and willfully violated it. 
* The defendant's attacks on witnesses and jurors pose a serious threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. 
* The language of the Gag Order is clear and unambiguous, and the defendant's attempts to argue otherwise are disingenuous. 
* Reposts of news articles are still violations of the Gag Order because they require an active decision to share the content. 

**Defendant's Arguments:**

* The defendant is facing a barrage of political attacks and is entitled to respond. 
* The defendant's comments were about political matters, not about the specific testimony of witnesses.
* The Gag Order is ambiguous and allows for the defendant to respond to political attacks.
* Reposts are not the defendant's own statements and should not be considered violations of the Gag Order.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* The court accepted certain exhibits into evidence as business records, including emails and texts. 
* The court ruled that the exhibits containing references to polygraphs will be redacted.

## Reasoning:

* The court expressed concern regarding the defendant's repeated alleged violations of the Gag Order and the potential impact on the integrity of the judicial proceedings. 
* The court acknowledged the importance of the "political attacks" exception, but noted the potential for abuse and the need for a clear distinction between political commentary and attempts to influence witnesses.
* The court determined that the exhibits offered by the People were admissible as business records, but would consider any objections based on embedded hearsay.
* The court expressed a need for further research regarding the admissibility of statements made by Stephen Bannon and the potential applicability of the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.

## Significant Quotes:

* **Mr. Conroy:** "The defendant has violated this order repeatedly and he hasn't stopped."
* **Mr. Conroy:** "The defendant knows the terms of the April 1st order. He has repeatedly complained about the order on his social media account."
* **Mr. Blanch:** "There is no dispute that President Trump is facing a barrage of political attacks from all sides, including from the two witnesses who are referenced in the early posts."
* **Mr. Blanch:** "President Trump is being very careful to comply with your Honor's rules."
* **Judge Merchan:** "I think you understand the difference between what is a summary criminal contempt and what is not a summary criminal contempt."
* **Judge Merchan:** "You are losing all credibility with the Court."
* **Judge Merchan:** "You are not giving me anything to hang my hat on to say, yeah, you're right, the reposts, that was unambiguous."
* **Judge Merchan:** "The one statement that is made may not move the ball, but if that one statement in the context of everything else does, then it would be admissible."

## Outcomes and Implications:

* The court has not yet ruled on the defendant's alleged contempt of court. 
* The admissibility of certain exhibits remains unresolved, particularly those containing hearsay statements.
* The court's decisions and reasoning in this case could set a precedent for the interpretation and enforcement of Gag Orders in future cases.
* This case continues to have significant implications for the ongoing legal and political landscape surrounding Donald J. Trump.

## Core Issues

The core issue of the case is whether Donald Trump violated New York's criminal statute for falsifying business records by orchestrating payments to suppress negative news stories during the 2016 presidential campaign. This specifically concerns the payments made to Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford (Stormy Daniels). 

## Facts of the Case

* **Karen McDougal:**
    * Alleged to have had an affair with Donald Trump.
    * Sought to sell her story to a media outlet.
    * Agreed to a deal with American Media Inc. (AMI) for $150,000 to suppress her story.
    * The deal was structured as a contract for a monthly column in AMI magazines, but the real purpose was to silence her.
* **Stephanie Clifford (Stormy Daniels):**
    * Alleged to have had an affair with Donald Trump.
    * Sought to sell her story to a media outlet.
    * Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, initiated negotiations with Clifford to suppress her story.
    * Cohen allegedly paid Clifford $130,000 to keep her silent.
* **AMI and the Suppressions:**
    * AMI engaged in "checkbook journalism" to buy and suppress negative stories.
    * They used source agreements and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to control information.
    * The payments to McDougal and Clifford were made in coordination with Trump's campaign or at his request.
    * AMI made false statements in public releases about the nature of the deals with McDougal and Clifford.
    * AMI ultimately entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Southern District of New York for campaign finance violations, admitting to the payments and their intent to influence the election.

## Legal Arguments

* **Plaintiff (People of New York):**
    * Argues that Trump orchestrated payments to suppress negative stories, which constitutes a violation of New York's falsifying business records statute.
    * Presents evidence of AMI's intent to influence the election through these payments and their coordination with the Trump campaign.
* **Defendant (Donald Trump):**
    * Argues that the payments were not intended to influence the election, but were personal transactions made by Michael Cohen, not him.
    * Contests the legal interpretation of the falsifying business records statute in this context.

## Rulings and Decisions

* **Exhibit 169 (Cameron Stracher email):** Judge rules that this exhibit cannot be admitted through Mr. Pecker, but potentially through another witness. 
* **Exhibit 163 (Dylan Howard email chain):**  Judge rules that the bottom portion of the email chain can be redacted to remove details about the Dino Sajudin story. The rest of the chain is admissible as a business record and potential co-conspirator statement. 
* **Exhibit 172A (Dylan Howard texts):** Judge rules that the texts are not admissible as business records or co-conspirator statements and are excluded. 
* **Exhibit 171A (Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez texts):** Judge rules that the texts are admissible as a business record and potential co-conspirator statement.  However, the factual assertions made by Gina Rodriguez are not to be considered for the truth.
* **Exhibit 180 (Wall Street Journal article):** Judge rules that the article is admissible to demonstrate it was published on November 4th, but not for the truth of the matters asserted.
* **Exhibit 182 (Non-Prosecution Agreement):** Judge rules that the agreement is admissible to assess Mr. Pecker's credibility and provide context but is not evidence of Donald Trump's guilt.
* **Exhibit 183 (Cooperation Letter):** Judge rules that the agreement is admissible to assess Mr. Pecker's credibility and provide context but is not evidence of Donald Trump's guilt.
* **Order to Show Cause:** The judge signs an Order to Show Cause, holding Donald Trump in contempt of court for violating a gag order.

## Reasoning

* The judge provides reasoning for each ruling on the admissibility of evidence, largely focused on the hearsay rule and the co-conspirator exception. 
* He also discusses the potential for prejudice to the defense and the need to ensure fairness in the trial.
* Regarding the gag order violation, the judge finds that Trump's comments constitute contempt because they relate directly to the trial, including witness testimony and the jury selection process. 

## Significant Quotes

* "I want to thank you for handling the McDougal situation." - Donald Trump to David Pecker during a meeting.
* "I'll take care of it." - Donald Trump to David Pecker, referencing Michael Cohen's bonus and the payments to suppress negative stories.
* "The Boss is going to be very angry at you." - Michael Cohen to David Pecker, after Pecker refused to reimburse AMI for the Stormy Daniels payment.
* "I'm not going forward. The deal is off. Rip it up." - David Pecker to Michael Cohen, refusing to execute the agreement to transfer the McDougal rights to Trump.

## Outcomes and Implications

* The trial continues with the examination of David Pecker, the former CEO of AMI.
* The judge's decision to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court is a significant development in the case, highlighting the seriousness of the gag order violation.
* The ruling on the admissibility of evidence sets a precedent for the scope of evidence that can be used in the trial.
* The outcomes of the trial will have significant implications for the ongoing legal and political landscape regarding Donald Trump.

* **Attorneys for the Defense:** Todd Blanche, Esq. (Blanche Law), Emil Bove, Esq., Susan Necheles, Esq., and Gedalia M. Stern, Esq. (Necheles Law, LLP)
* **Judge:** Honorable Juan M. Merchan, Justice

**Core Issues:**

* **Falsifying Business Records:** The core dispute revolves around whether Donald J. Trump falsified business records related to payments made to silence negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential campaign.
* **Co-Conspirator Status:** The court is addressing the issue of Dylan Howard (from the National Enquirer) being a co-conspirator in the alleged scheme.
* **Impeachment by Omission:** The People are objecting to the defense's questioning tactics, alleging that they are attempting to impeach witnesses by omission (leaving out important information).
* **Confidentiality of Attorney-Client Communications:** The defense is challenging the use of attorney Keith Davidson as a source for the National Enquirer, arguing that it violated attorney-client confidentiality.
* **Witness Credibility:** The defense is actively attempting to undermine the credibility of David Pecker (former CEO of American Media Inc.) through inconsistencies in his testimony.

**Facts of the Case:**

* The case focuses on payments made by American Media Inc. (AMI), owner of the National Enquirer, to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels to silence negative stories about Donald J. Trump.
* The payments were made during the 2016 presidential campaign.
* The defense argues that these payments were part of AMI's standard operating procedures and not related to any scheme to influence the election.
* The prosecution alleges that the payments were part of a coordinated effort to suppress negative stories about Trump, constituting a campaign finance violation.
* The defense claims that the payments were made to protect AMI's business interests, not to benefit Trump's campaign.
* The defense emphasizes that the payments were made through AMI, not directly by Trump.
* The defense also highlights that the payments were not made at the request of Trump.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **The People:**  The prosecution argues that the payments were made to benefit Trump's campaign and therefore constitute a violation of campaign finance laws. They also argue that AMI's actions were taken in coordination with Trump's campaign.
* **The Defense:** The defense argues that the payments were made to protect AMI's business interests and were not intended to benefit Trump's campaign. They also argue that the payments were made in a way that was consistent with AMI's standard operating procedures.

* The court ruled that Dylan Howard is a co-conspirator in the case.
* The court allowed the defense to refresh the witness' recollection regarding a meeting with the District Attorney's Office but limited the scope of questioning.
* The court sustained objections to several questions about the credibility of other witnesses (Michael Cohen and Jeff Sessions).
* The court admitted into evidence a number of exhibits related to emails, contacts, and calendar entries from the Trump Organization and First Republic Bank.

**Reasoning:**

* The court's rationale for ruling that Dylan Howard is a co-conspirator is not explicitly stated in the excerpt provided. However, it's likely based on the evidence presented regarding his involvement in the alleged scheme.
* The court limited the defense's questioning regarding the District Attorney's Office meeting because the defense was attempting to introduce hearsay evidence and impeach the witness with what his attorneys had said, which is not permissible. 
* The court sustained objections regarding witness credibility because the defense was attempting to introduce opinion evidence about the credibility of other witnesses who had not yet testified. This is generally not allowed.

**Significant Quotes:**

* **Judge Merchan:** "Whoever the defendant is, whatever the position the defendant is running for and whoever represents him, you are all being well-compensated to come here and do a great job. To tell me not to hold it against your youth suggests that I shouldn't enforce the rules of evidence, and I am not going to do that." (Addressing the defense attorney's plea for leniency)
* **David Pecker:**  "I know what the truth is. I'm not -- I can't state what the -- what's here, why this was written this way. I know exactly what was said to me." (Responding to questions about inconsistencies between his testimony and FBI interview notes)

**Outcomes and Implications:**

* The trial is ongoing, and the court has not yet issued any final rulings or judgments.
* The case has significant implications for both Donald J. Trump and the legal landscape surrounding campaign finance laws.
* The prosecution's success could lead to charges against Trump, while a successful defense could set a precedent for shielding individuals from campaign finance violations if the payments are made through a third party.

**Note:** This analysis is based on the excerpt provided. It's important to remember that the full trial record may contain further evidence and arguments that could influence the outcome of the case. 


## Case Information:

* **Case Number:** 71543/2023
* **Title:** The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump
* **Date:** April 30, 2024

## Parties Involved:

* **Plaintiff:** The People of the State of New York
* **Defendant:** Donald J. Trump
* **Attorneys for the People:** Alvin L. Bragg, Jr., Esq. (New York County District Attorney), Joshua Steinglass, Esq., Matthew Colangelo, Esq., Susan Hoffinger, Esq., Christopher Conroy, Esq., Rebecca Mangold, Esq., Katherine Ellis, Esq. 
* **Attorneys for the Defendant:** Todd Blanche, Esq., Emil Bove, Esq., Susan Necheles, Esq., Kendra Wharton, Esq. 
* **Judge:** Honorable Juan M. Merchan, Justice of the Supreme Court

## Core Issues:

The document primarily focuses on the testimony of witnesses related to the alleged falsification of business records in the case against Donald Trump.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Contempt Hearings:** The court handed down decisions on contempt charges against Trump related to incidents involving the release of confidential information.
* **Account Opening and Wire Transfer Process:**  The testimony of Gary Farro, a former Senior Managing Director at First Republic Bank, details the process of opening an account and transferring funds, including the bank's scrutiny for specific types of transactions.
* **Negotiations with Dylan Howard:**  The testimony of Keith Davidson, an attorney, details his negotiations with Dylan Howard (former Chief Content Officer of American Media Inc.) regarding the sale of stories involving Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.
* **Michael Cohen's Involvement:** The testimony focuses on the role Michael Cohen played in the Daniels deal and the alleged attempts to influence witnesses through intimidation and public pressure campaigns.

## Facts of the Case:

The document presents the following key facts:

* **Essential Consultants LLC:** Michael Cohen opened an account for this entity, which was described as a "real estate consulting company," in October 2016.
* **HELOC Transfer:** Cohen transferred $131,000 from his HELOC account to the Essential Consultants LLC account to fund it.
* **Wire Transfer:** A wire transfer of $130,000 was made from Essential Consultants LLC to Keith M. Davidson and Associates PLC, an attorney client trust account, the day after the account was opened.
* **Karen McDougal:**  McDougal, a former model, was Davidson's client in 2016 and had a relationship with Donald Trump. Davidson negotiated with AMI to acquire her story, which ultimately resulted in a $150,000 payment.
* **Stormy Daniels:**  Daniels, an adult film star, was also Davidson's client. He was involved in negotiating a deal with AMI for her story, which fell apart before being resurrected by Michael Cohen.  Cohen ultimately paid $130,000 for Daniels' story. 

## Legal Arguments:

* **People:** The People argue that the witnesses' testimony, specifically the account opening documents and wire transfers, show that Trump's actions were not consistent with the stated purpose of the accounts (real estate consulting). They also argue that Trump's public statements about Michael Cohen and his cooperation with law enforcement demonstrate a consciousness of guilt.
* **Defense:** The defense argues that the account opening documents and wire transfers are consistent with real estate transactions. They argue that the People's attempts to introduce evidence of Trump's public statements about Cohen are irrelevant and prejudicial, and they claim that Cohen's motivations for cooperating with law enforcement are suspect.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* **Contempt:** The court found Trump in contempt of court for nine violations of a prior order. A $1,000 fine was imposed for each of the six violations related to the second and third contempt charges.
* **Evidentiary Rulings:**
    * The court ruled that the texts involving Gina Rodriguez would be excluded due to their prejudicial nature and lack of relevance.
    * The court ruled that the defense had opened the door to the People introducing evidence of a public pressure campaign, but limited that evidence to rebutting claims that witnesses are benefiting from their cooperation and explaining inconsistencies in their testimony. The court denied the People's request to use that evidence for the purpose of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt.
    * The court allowed the People to introduce the exhibits related to the account opening documents, wire transfers, and text exchanges between Davidson, Howard, and Cohen.

## Reasoning:

* **Contempt:** The court's reasoning for the contempt rulings was not explicitly stated in the document.
* **Evidentiary Rulings:** The court found that the texts involving Gina Rodriguez were too prejudicial and did not provide necessary context. While the defense did open the door to the People's evidence of a pressure campaign, the court limited the use of that evidence because it believed it was not sufficiently probative of consciousness of guilt. The court found that the exhibits related to the bank documents and text exchanges were relevant to the case.

## Significant Quotes:

* **Judge:** "I think going through the words by the defense, they mostly concede they opened the door. The question is as to what, what can you use that for."
* **Witness (Davidson):** "I thought it was odd, certainly. I thought it was odd." 
* **Witness (Davidson):** "It was a very unfortunate, regrettable text I sent. That phrase is -- is not one that I used or came up with.  That -- that term, I think, by one of -- one of Karen's -- (witness clears throat) -- associates that was at that first meeting. There was several women who were, um, leaning on Karen to sign the deal with ABC."
* **Witness (Davidson):** "It was just one more snafu." 

## Outcomes and Implications:

* **Contempt:** The court found Trump guilty of contempt and imposed a fine.
* **Evidentiary Rulings:** The rulings on the evidentiary issues could significantly affect the trial's direction, particularly with the limitations placed on the People's ability to use Trump's public statements. 
* **Precedent:** The rulings in this case may set precedents for similar cases regarding the admissibility of evidence of public pressure campaigns and the use of text messages as evidence in legal proceedings.

## Additional Notes:

The document includes numerous pauses and hesitations in witness testimonies, indicating potential issues with memory, reluctance to answer, or sensitive information.  The use of pseudonyms in the Daniels deal further complicates the understanding of the transactions.

## Core Issues:

The core issue is whether Donald J. Trump violated a court order restricting extrajudicial statements in his criminal case. The People argue he violated the order on four occasions, while the Defendant claims his statements were not violations or were in response to political attacks.

## Facts of the Case:

* The case is a criminal trial in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.
* The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, is charged with falsifying business records.
* The Court issued a Gag Order, restricting extrajudicial statements by the Defendant, to protect the integrity of the trial and witnesses.
* The People allege that the Defendant violated the order on nine previous occasions. 
* The People argue that the Defendant violated the order on four additional occasions:
    * Making statements about the jury's composition and the trial's speed.
    * Making statements about witnesses David Pecker and Michael Cohen, including their credibility.
* The Defendant's attorneys argue that the Defendant's statements were not violations, were in response to political attacks, and were not intended to intimidate witnesses.

## Legal Arguments:

**The People's Arguments:**

* The Gag Order is a lawful order with a clear mandate.
* The Defendant made statements with knowledge and willfully violated the order on each of the four occasions.
* The Defendant's statements are corrosive to the proceeding and the administration of justice.
* The Defendant's statements about Michael Cohen are not protected as responses to political attacks, as they are related to the heart of the proceedings.

**The Defendant's Arguments:**

* The Gag Order's purpose is to protect witnesses from reprisal by the Defendant, which is not relevant to the four statements in question. 
* The Defendant is running for President and has to be able to respond to political attacks, which includes responding to statements made by President Biden and Michael Cohen.
* The Defendant's statements about David Pecker were neutral and factual, not threatening.
* The statements about the jury were about the overall proceedings being unfair and political, not about specific jurors. 
* Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels should not be protected by the Gag Order, as they are not people who need protection from the Defendant's statements.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* The Court denied the Defendant's request for a blanket exemption from the Gag Order for all statements responding to political attacks. 
* The Court indicated that it was not terribly concerned about the Defendant's statements about David Pecker. 
* The Court's ruling on the Defendant's other violations was not yet announced, as the hearing was adjourned before a decision was made. 

## Reasoning:

* The Court focused on the purpose of the Gag Order: to protect the integrity of the trial and witnesses from intimidation by the Defendant. 
* The Court stressed that the Defendant's actions are not comparable to the actions of the media or other individuals, as the Defendant is the subject of the Gag Order and has a different burden to fulfill.
* The Court noted the Defendant's previous violations and expressed concern about the Defendant's willingness to make statements that could disrupt the proceedings.

## Significant Quotes:

* **Judge Merchan:** "My main concern is the conduct that took place after the Gag Order was implemented." 
* **Judge Merchan:** "What's happening in this trial is no surprise to anyone. I mean, the former President of the United States is on trial."
* **Judge Merchan:** "I just don't have that authority. So, I don't see the comparison."
* **Judge Merchan:** "I am not going to give advanced rulings. I'm not going to be in a position of looking at posts and determining in advance whether you should or should not post these on Truth Social as part of your official campaign website."
* **Judge Merchan:** "I think the best advice you can give your client is to do without, steer clear." 

## Outcomes and Implications:

* The Defendant's request for a blanket exemption from the Gag Order was denied.
* The Court is likely to find further violations of the Gag Order based on the Defendant's statements about Michael Cohen.
* The Court's rulings on the Gag Order set a precedent for similar cases involving high-profile defendants who are also political figures.
* The case is ongoing, and further decisions regarding the Gag Order and the Defendant's violations are expected.

* **Admissibility of Evidence:** The primary dispute revolves around the admissibility of various exhibits, primarily related to social media posts and news articles, offered by the prosecution.
* **Hearsay:** The defense argues that many of the exhibits contain hearsay information, which is inadmissible unless a proper foundation is laid.
* **Business Records Exception:** The defense objects to some of the exhibits being admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, arguing that the foundation for their reliability is insufficient.
* **Molineux Exception:** The prosecution seeks to introduce evidence related to the Access Hollywood tape under the Molineux exception, which allows for evidence of prior bad acts to show intent, motive, or knowledge. The defense opposes this, citing the recent Weinstein decision.
* **Presidential Immunity:** The defense objects to any testimony from Hope Hicks concerning statements by Donald Trump while he was President, arguing that this falls under presidential immunity.

## Facts of the Case:

* Donald Trump is facing charges of falsifying business records in the first degree.
* The case revolves around alleged attempts to influence witnesses in the case.
* The prosecution is relying on evidence of extrajudicial statements made by Trump on social media and in news articles, as well as testimony from witnesses who interacted with him. 
* The defense maintains that Trump did nothing wrong and that the prosecution is pursuing a "witch hunt".

## Legal Arguments:

* **Prosecution:** The prosecution argues that the exhibits are admissible under various exceptions to the hearsay rule, including the business records exception and the admission exception. They also argue that the Molineux exception allows for the introduction of the Access Hollywood tape to show Trump's intent and motive.
* **Defense:** The defense raises multiple objections, including hearsay, lack of foundation for business records, and relevance. They also argue that the Weinstein decision should preclude the use of the Access Hollywood tape as prejudicial. They object to any testimony regarding Trump's actions as President, citing presidential immunity.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* The court rules in favor of the prosecution on most of the evidentiary objections, allowing the introduction of the exhibits with some exceptions. 
* The court overrules the defense's objections to the Molineux exception, allowing the introduction of evidence related to the Access Hollywood tape. 
* The court sustains the defense's objection regarding the presidential immunity issue, but notes that the prosecution can attempt to elicit testimony from witnesses regarding statements made by Trump outside of his presidential capacity.
* The court denies the prosecution's request to allow cross-examination of Trump on prior contempt findings, finding that it would be too prejudicial.

## Reasoning:

* The court finds that the prosecution has laid a sufficient foundation for the reliability of the exhibits to overcome hearsay objections.
* The court agrees with the prosecution's interpretation of the Molineux exception and finds that the Access Hollywood tape is relevant to showing Trump's intent and motive.
* The court recognizes the presidential immunity doctrine but believes that the prosecution can elicit testimony regarding Trump's statements as a private citizen. 
* The court finds that allowing cross-examination on the contempt findings would be excessively prejudicial to Trump.

## Significant Quotes:

* **Judge Merchan on Trump's right to testify:** "I want to stress, Mr. Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify at trial, if that is what you decide to do after consultation with your attorneys. That is a constitutional right that cannot be denied or abrogated in any way."
* **Todd Blanche on the Access Hollywood tape:** "The only reason why the Access tape -- Hollywood Access tape is coming in at all in this trial, under the Court's ruling, is to show intent and motive and to show what -- how the campaign responded and why they responded the way it did."
* **Judge Merchan on the need to establish the date of the Access Hollywood tape:** "The People do have a right to establish the date that it was printed. You may want to stipulate to that."
* **Judge Merchan on the defense's objection to Exhibit 408B:** "Going back to my earlier ruling, if you go back to the motions in limine, I had ruled that we would take this up later, that we would have to wait and see what happens. I had not at that time decided that these types of things could come in. However, I subsequently ruled that the door had been opened, and based upon that, I am allowing them to come in."
* **Judge Merchan on cross-examination regarding contempt findings:** "I agree with Mr. Blanche. I think for a jury to hear that this Court, the same Judge that is presiding over this case has found Mr. Trump to be in contempt on this case, I think would be so prejudicial, it would be very, very difficult for a jury to look past that."

## Outcomes and Implications:

* The court's rulings favor the prosecution, allowing them to introduce a significant amount of evidence that could be damaging to Trump.
* The defense will likely appeal the court's rulings on the admissibility of the exhibits. 
* The case could set a precedent for the use of social media posts and news articles as evidence in criminal trials.
* The court's denial of the prosecution's request to cross-examine Trump on contempt findings will likely be appealed by the prosecution. 
* The outcome of the case could have significant implications for Trump's political future.

* **Attorneys for the Defense:** Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, Susan Necheles, Kendra Wharton
* **Judge:** Honorable Juan M. Merchan, Justice

## Core Issues:

* The document primarily focuses on the ongoing trial of Donald J. Trump for falsifying business records in the first degree. 
* It revolves around the issue of whether certain documents offered by the prosecution are admissible as business records, particularly invoices and notes related to payments made to Michael Cohen. 
* The document also addresses a motion for contempt against Trump for allegedly violating the court's order restricting extrajudicial speech.

## Facts of the Case:

* The Prosecution has filed three motions to find Trump in contempt of court for violating the court's order restricting extrajudicial speech.
* The document details the financial structure of the Trump Organization, including its various entities and their ownership by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust.
* Jeffrey McConney, a former Senior Vice President and Controller for the Trump Organization, testifies about the company's financial practices, including its use of the MDS accounting system.
* McConney describes a conversation with Allen Weisselberg in January 2017, where Weisselberg instructed him to reimburse Michael Cohen for a total of $420,000, including a prior year bonus and other payments, over a 12-month period.
*  McConney testifies that he received a bank statement and took notes during the conversation.  These documents show handwritten notes and calculations related to the reimbursement payments.
* The document details the process for approving invoices and cutting checks for various Trump Organization entities, including the DJT personal account and the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust account.
* The document also shows emails and invoices related to the reimbursement payments, highlighting the process by which they were approved and processed.
* Deborah Tarasoff, the Accounts Payable Supervisor, testifies about her role in handling invoices and checks for the Trump Organization, including those related to the Michael Cohen payments.

## Legal Arguments:

* **Prosecution:**  The prosecution argues that the documents offered are admissible as business records, citing the "coconspirator exception" and the business records exception to the hearsay rule. They also argue that the invoices and notes are relevant to the case and show how payments were made and recorded.
* **Defense:** The defense objects to the admission of invoices as business records, arguing that they are inadmissible hearsay offered for the truth. They also object to the admission of Capital One bank records as a business record, arguing that the witness cannot adequately explain the information contained within those records.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* **Contempt Motion:** The judge found Trump in contempt of court for the tenth time, stating that the $1,000 fines were not serving as a deterrent and that he would consider a jail sanction in the future.
* **Documents as Business Records:**  The judge ruled that the invoices and notes are admissible as business records, despite the defense's objections.
* **Bank Records:** The judge overruled the defense's objection to the admission of the Capital One bank records, stating that the witness could testify that the records were part of the Trump Organization's standard business practices.

## Reasoning:

* **Contempt:** The judge based his ruling on Trump's continued violations of the court's order, which he deemed a threat to the administration of justice.
* **Business Records:** The judge found that the prosecution had laid a sufficient business records foundation for the documents, indicating that the Trump Organization relied on these documents for its own business operations.
* **Bank Records:** The judge determined that Tarasoff, as a Trump Organization employee, could testify about the cancelled checks and their role in the organization's accounting practices. 

## Significant Quotes:

* **Judge:** "Your continued violations of this Court's lawful Order threaten to interfere with the administration of justice in constant attacks which constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue."
* **Judge:** "I'll do that first thing.  I believe there was no objection from the Defense.  Not at all."
* **Defense:** "The idea that he would be handed a thumb drive and asked a series of general questions with respect to a broad category of types of documents and tick off yes answers to those questions is just not sufficient under these circumstances."
* **Defense:** "We believe it's a business record of a bank. That's our objection."
* **Prosecution:** "We have already laid that foundation. So he -- setting aside that this is past business records that Mr. McConney laid the foundation for, receiving of the invoices by email and incorporating it into The Trump Organization and relying on them for Trump Organization business makes them admissible."

## Outcomes and Implications:

* **Contempt:** The court has continued to hold Trump in contempt, highlighting the seriousness of his alleged actions. This ruling could lead to potential jail time in the future.
* **Business Records:** The court's ruling on the admissibility of the documents will likely have a significant impact on the trial.  The prosecution will now be able to use the invoices and notes to present evidence related to the payments to Michael Cohen. 
* **Bank Records:** The ruling on the Capital One bank records could set a precedent for the admissibility of similar documents as business records in future cases.

## Further Developments:

The document ends with the court adjourning the trial to the following day.  The document leaves open the possibility of recalling Georgia Longstreet-Joseph as a witness to provide further testimony, which the defense opposes.

**Core Issues:**

* The primary issue revolves around the admissibility of testimony from Stormy Daniels regarding her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. 
* The Defense argues that the details of the encounter are irrelevant and prejudicial to the case, which focuses on charges related to falsifying business records.
* The Prosecution argues that the details are relevant to establish Daniels' credibility and the narrative surrounding the alleged payment to her to remain silent about the encounter before the 2016 election.
* The Court grapples with balancing the relevance of the testimony with the potential for prejudice.

**Facts of the Case:**

* The case centers on the alleged payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump in 2006.
* The payment was allegedly made shortly before the 2016 presidential election.
* The prosecution claims that the payment was made to conceal the affair from voters and that records related to the payment were falsified.
* The defense argues that the payment was a legitimate business transaction and that no records were falsified.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Defense:**
    * The details of the alleged sexual encounter are irrelevant to the charges of falsifying business records.
    * The testimony is unduly prejudicial and will unfairly influence the jury.
    * The prosecution is attempting to use the testimony to embarrass the defendant and inflame the jury.

    * The testimony is necessary to complete the story of the events that led to the alleged falsification of business records.
    * The defense opened the door to questioning Daniels' credibility through their opening statement and cross-examination of witnesses.

**Rulings and Decisions:**

* The Court rules in favor of the prosecution, allowing Daniels to testify about the alleged encounter.
* However, the Court limits the scope of the testimony, instructing the prosecution not to delve into Daniels' emotional state during the encounter.
* The Court also notes the defense's objection to the introduction of evidence related to a threat Daniels claims she received in 2011, but will entertain a limiting instruction on this issue if requested by the defense.
* The Court denies the defense's motion for a mistrial, citing the prosecution's efforts to limit the testimony and the defense's own responsibility for raising certain issues. 

**Reasoning:**

* The Court reasons that the details of the alleged encounter are relevant to the prosecution's case, particularly regarding Daniels' credibility and the narrative surrounding the payment. 
* The Court balances this with the potential for prejudice, limiting the testimony to the facts and avoiding questions about Daniels' emotional state. 
* The Court also recognizes that the defense opened the door to questioning Daniels' credibility and that the prosecution is trying to address those concerns.

**Core Issues:**

* **False Business Records:** The primary issue involves the alleged falsification of business records related to a hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels. 
* **Credibility of Stormy Daniels:** The defense extensively challenged the credibility of Stormy Daniels, her motivations, and consistency of her story, highlighting inconsistencies between her current testimony and past interviews. 
* **Gag Order:** The defense argued for the modification of the Gag Order to allow Donald Trump to respond publicly to allegations made against him during the trial, particularly regarding Stormy Daniels' testimony. 
* **Motion for Mistrial:** The defense renewed their motion for a mistrial, arguing that Stormy Daniels' testimony was highly prejudicial, irrelevant to the charges, and introduced unnecessary details regarding the alleged sexual encounter.

**Facts of the Case:**

* **Hush Money Payment:**  The case centers on a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, by Michael Cohen, then Donald Trump's personal attorney, shortly before the 2016 presidential election. 
* **Non-Disclosure Agreement:** The payment was made in exchange for a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) signed by Daniels, preventing her from publicly disclosing a purported sexual encounter with Donald Trump. 
* **Allegations of Falsification:** The indictment alleges that the Trump Organization falsely recorded the payment as legal expenses to conceal its true nature and avoid negative publicity during the election. 
* **Stormy Daniels' Testimony:** Daniels provided extensive testimony regarding the alleged sexual encounter, her motivations for signing the NDA, and her subsequent efforts to make money from her story.  The defense pointed out inconsistencies between her current testimony and past accounts, particularly those given in 2011 and 2018.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **People's Arguments:** The prosecution argued that Daniels' testimony corroborated her account of the sexual encounter, increasing the motivation to silence her. The prosecution emphasized the importance of the details provided by Daniels, even if messy, as they contribute to her credibility and the understanding of Trump's alleged motive.
* **Defense Arguments:** The defense maintained that Daniels' story was false and had evolved over time. They argued that the detailed descriptions of the alleged encounter were highly prejudicial and irrelevant to the core charges of falsifying business records. They also argued that the Gag Order should be modified to allow Donald Trump to respond publicly to allegations made against him in court.

**Rulings and Decisions:**

* **Preclusion of Prior Arrest Record:** The court precluded the defense from introducing evidence of a prior arrest record of Stormy Daniels that had not resulted in a conviction. 
* **Limiting Instruction:** The court agreed to provide a limiting instruction regarding the testimony of Stormy Daniels, clarifying the purpose of her testimony and its relevance to the charges.
* **Admission of Exhibits:**  The court admitted into evidence numerous exhibits presented by both the prosecution and the defense, including emails, FedEx invoices, social media posts, and excerpts from a book co-authored by Donald Trump.
* **Gag Order:** The court denied the defense's request to modify the Gag Order to allow Donald Trump to respond publicly to allegations made against him in court. 
* **Motion for Mistrial:** The court denied the defense's renewed motion for a mistrial, concluding that while some details elicited were unnecessary, they did not rise to the level of prejudice that would warrant a mistrial.

**Reasoning:**

* **Credibility:** The court recognized that the prosecution was attempting to rehabilitate the credibility of Stormy Daniels, a key witness in the case. The court acknowledged that the details provided, even if potentially embarrassing, contributed to her credibility and the understanding of the defendant's alleged motive.
* **Gag Order:** The court upheld the Gag Order, citing the need to protect the integrity of the proceedings and the safety of witnesses. The court found that allowing the defendant to publicly respond to accusations made against him in court could deter future witnesses from testifying.
* **Motion for Mistrial:** The court acknowledged that some questions and answers were irrelevant and potentially prejudicial. However, the court emphasized that the defense had effectively challenged Daniels' credibility through cross-examination. Ultimately, the court found that the details elicited did not warrant a mistrial.

**Significant Quotes:**

* **Judge Merchan:** “My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels, or a witness who has already testified. My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole.”
* **Defense Attorney Todd Blanche:** “It's not -- this isn't President Trump, again, being able to say this never happened; this isn't true. It's now him having to not be able to respond to this new version of events that now deals very deeply with a very different issue than a sexual event that took place in 2006.”
* **Prosecution Attorney Christopher Conroy:** “This Order was issued to protect the witnesses, the citizens participating as jurors, all the people participating in this proceeding, and the very proceeding itself.”

**Outcomes and Implications:**

* **Trial Continues:** The trial continues with the court denying the defense's motion for a mistrial and the Gag Order remaining in place.
* **Credibility of Daniels:** The defense's focus on discrediting Stormy Daniels continues to be a central strategy.
* **Impact on Future Witnesses:** The court's decision to uphold the Gag Order could deter future witnesses from testifying. 
* **Public Discourse:** The ongoing court proceedings are likely to continue to be a subject of public discourse and political commentary.

**Overall:**

The trial continues with the defense facing an uphill battle to convince the court and jury that the charges against Donald Trump are baseless. The prosecution is working to establish the credibility of its key witness, Stormy Daniels, and to demonstrate the defendant's motive to falsify business records. The court is tasked with balancing the rights of the defendant with the need to ensure a fair trial and the safety of witnesses.

* **Judge:** Honorable Juan M. Merchan, Justice of the Supreme Court

## Core Issues:

The core issue is the admissibility of evidence concerning Donald Trump's knowledge and understanding of campaign finance laws, specifically his 1999 statement about his experience with such laws, as well as the admissibility of a Separation Agreement between Allen Weisselberg and The Trump Organization. 

## Facts of the Case:

The document is a transcript of court proceedings in a criminal trial against Donald J. Trump. The transcript covers the cross-examination and redirect of Madeleine Westerhout, a former White House aide, as well as the testimony of Daniel Dixon, Jennie Tomalin, and Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, witnesses called by the prosecution to provide evidence related to phone records and social media posts. The document also includes a debate between the prosecution and defense regarding the admissibility of two pieces of evidence. 

## Legal Arguments:

* **Prosecution's Argument:** The prosecution argues that Trump's 1999 statement about his experience with campaign finance laws is relevant to his state of mind in 2016 and 2017, as the laws have not significantly changed in that time. They also argue that the Separation Agreement between Allen Weisselberg and The Trump Organization is relevant to explain his absence from the trial and his potential bias, due to the terms of the agreement.
* **Defense's Argument:** The defense argues that Trump's 1999 statement is not relevant to his state of mind in 2016 and 2017 because there have been significant changes to campaign finance laws in that time. They also argue that the Separation Agreement is irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, as it would require a complex discussion about Weisselberg's legal situation, which is not relevant to the case. They argue that Weisselberg's absence is more likely due to the fact that the prosecution initiated a perjury prosecution against him.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* **Trump's 1999 Statement:** The judge rules that the 1999 statement is not admissible, finding it too attenuated and requiring too much speculation to connect it to his state of mind in 2016 and 2017.
* **Weisselberg's Separation Agreement:** The judge expresses skepticism about the relevance and need for the Separation Agreement, highlighting the complexity of the issue and potential for prejudice. The defense stipulates that Weisselberg is in jail for perjury. The judge reserves his ruling on the admissibility of the agreement, suggesting that he would be more likely to allow it if the prosecution had made efforts to compel Weisselberg's testimony.

## Reasoning:

The judge bases his ruling on the Trump statement on the lack of a direct connection between the statement and the defendant's state of mind in the relevant time period. He finds the argument too speculative. His skepticism about the Separation Agreement stems from concerns about undue prejudice and the need for complex discussions about a witness not present at the trial. The judge suggests that he would be more likely to allow the Agreement if efforts were made to compel the witness's testimony, highlighting the need for a demonstrable attempt to address the issue of unavailability.

## Significant Quotes:

* **Judge:** "I understand what you are saying, that the laws did not change between 1999 and 2017. I still feel that that's pretty attenuated. Plus, you are asking the jurors to draw an inference that because he knew the laws in 1999, he still knew them in 2015 and 2017. I think that's a lot of speculation."
* **Defense:** "The reason Mr. Weisselberg is not a witness to either side is because the District Attorney's Office initiated a perjury prosecution in the lead-up to this case."
* **Prosecution:** "Mr. Weisselberg's interests right now are very aligned with the Defendant's. I think this Agreement points that out."
* **Judge:** "It seems to me, if I'm understanding correctly, that that step [compelling testimony] has not yet been taken. Not that it has to be taken. It's a factor for me in making this decision."

## Outcomes and Implications:

The outcomes of the case are:

* Trump's 1999 statement will not be admitted as evidence.
* The judge has reserved a ruling on the admissibility of Weisselberg's Separation Agreement, requiring further consideration.

The implications of these decisions are:

* The prosecution will be unable to use Trump's 1999 statement to argue that he had knowledge of campaign finance laws in the relevant time period. 
* The admissibility of the Separation Agreement, which could be used to argue that Weisselberg is unavailable due to his legal situation, remains uncertain. This could impact the prosecution's ability to address Weisselberg's absence and any potential bias. 

The ongoing debate regarding the admissibility of the Separation Agreement is notable as it raises questions about the burden of proof on the prosecution to demonstrate the unavailability of a witness and the potential for prejudice when dealing with a witness who is unavailable due to legal circumstances.


## Case Information:

* **Case Number:** 71543/2023
* **Title:** People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump

* **Attorneys for the People:** Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Rebecca Mangold, Christopher Conroy, Katherine Ellis

## Core Issues:

The document focuses on the testimony of Michael Cohen, a key witness in the case against Donald Trump for falsifying business records in the first degree. The core issue revolves around whether Trump, through Cohen, attempted to suppress negative stories about himself during his 2016 presidential campaign by making payments to silence alleged mistresses. The document highlights various instances where Cohen negotiated with AMI (publisher of the National Enquirer) to purchase or suppress stories, notably those involving Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.

## Facts of the Case:

* Michael Cohen was a longtime executive vice president and special counsel to Donald Trump at The Trump Organization from 2007 to 2017.
* Cohen had a close relationship with Trump and reported directly to him.
* Cohen frequently negotiated and renegotiated bills for Trump, including those for Trump University and Trump Entertainment Resorts. 
* Cohen often interacted with the press on Trump's behalf, attempting to minimize negative stories and enhance positive ones.
* Trump was exploring a run for presidency in 2011, but decided against it.
* In 2015, Trump announced his run for presidency. Cohen was a surrogate for the campaign.
* Cohen had a close working relationship with David Pecker, CEO of AMI, and Dylan Howard, an employee at AMI.
* In August 2015, Cohen, Trump, and Pecker met at Trump Tower to discuss how AMI could benefit Trump's campaign.
* AMI paid $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman to suppress a story about a possible lovechild of Trump.
* AMI also paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal to suppress a story about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump later reimbursed AMI for this payment.
* Cohen recorded a conversation with Trump in September 2016, discussing the purchase of various materials from AMI, including McDougal's story.
* Cohen created an LLC (Resolution Consultants LLC) to facilitate the purchase of the McDougal story from AMI, but it was ultimately not necessary as the story was deemed commercially successful.
* Cohen received a low bonus from Trump in December 2016, which he felt was disrespectful given his efforts on the campaign.
* Trump requested Cohen to "take care of" the Stormy Daniels story in 2016, which led to a $130,000 payment being made to Daniels through Cohen's LLC (Essential Consultants LLC). Trump later reimbursed Cohen for this payment.
* Cohen publicly announced his role as "Personal Counsel to President Trump" on January 18, 2017, on Sean Hannity's show.

## Legal Arguments:

The document does not explicitly present legal arguments. However, it lays out the factual basis for potential legal arguments related to:

* **Falsifying business records:** The document suggests that Trump may have falsified business records by obscuring the true nature of the payments made to silence alleged mistresses (McDougal and Daniels) through shell companies and false invoice descriptions.
* **Campaign finance violations:** The payments made to McDougal and Daniels could potentially be considered illegal campaign contributions, especially considering they were made to influence the election.
* **Fraud:** The document suggests that Cohen's involvement in creating shell companies and making payments with false pretenses could constitute fraud.

## Rulings and Decisions:

* The court ruled that the Separation Agreement, which was offered to justify the absence of a witness, would not be admitted as evidence. The judge reasoned that it would not prove any element of the offense and would not contribute to the prosecution's burden of proof.
* The court granted the prosecution's request to admit various exhibits as evidence, including emails, text messages, and call logs. 

## Reasoning:

The document does not explicitly present the court's reasoning behind the rulings and decisions. However, the judge's statement regarding the Separation Agreement suggests a focus on maintaining the integrity of the evidence presented and ensuring its relevance to the alleged crime.

## Significant Quotes:

* **"Irrespective of the Candidacy":** The Judge reserved decision on the "irrespective of the candidacy" instruction, but expressed inclination to use the People's proposal and the Defense's last sentence.
* **Press Exemption:** The Judge struck the "broad concept" sentence regarding the press exemption but agreed to include the example about solicitation letters.
* **Accomplice Instruction:** The Judge decided to use the "participated in" language from the CJI and changed "crime" to "crimes" to avoid undue attention to Cohen's specific convictions.

* **Intent to Defraud:** The Judge ruled in favor of the standard language from the CJI, rejecting the Defense's proposed expansion.

* **Exfoliation Instruction:** The Judge declined to give an "exfoliation" instruction regarding the phone resets and self-deleting apps, finding the evidence does not support it.
* **Retainer Agreements:** The Judge reserved decision on the curative instruction regarding the requirement of a written Retainer Agreement.
