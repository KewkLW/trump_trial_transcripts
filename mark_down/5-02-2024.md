1804 1 THE CLERK: This is The People of the State of 2 New York against Donald J. Trump, SMZ 71911 of '24. 3 Appearances, starting with the People, please. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADA Joshua 5 Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Christopher 6 Conroy, Becky Mangold and Katherine Ellis.

7 Good morning, everyone.

19 SMZ 71911 of '24.

20 I looked at the exhibits that were provided by 21 both the People and the Defense. The People provided four 22 exhibits, one for each one of those violations. The 23 Defense provided a number of exhibits, I believe it was 24 close to 500 pages in total, and also submitted a -- so, 25 People, why don't we begin with you going through each of 11 Trump, who is seated to my left. I am joined at counsel's 12 table by Emil Bove, Susan Necheles and Stephen Weiss. 13 Good morning. 14 THE COURT: Good morning.

15 Good morning, Mr. Trump. 16 As you know, I asked the jury to come in a little 17 bit later today, at ten o'clock, so that we could have our 18 hearing on the Order to Show Cause, which is identified as 10 Todd Blanche on behalf of President Donald J.

8 THE COURT: Good morning. 9 MR. BLANCHE: Good morning, your Honor.

1805 1 the violations, and explain to me why you believe that it 2 constitutes a violation. 3 MR. CONROY: Sure, Judge. 4 Unless your Honor prefers it, I think that I will 5 not play each of the video clips or even read the direct 6 language. I will just talk about each of them, and I will 11 a violation, you should do that.

12 MR. CONROY: Okay. 13 Judge, I just want to start by saying the 14 Defendant's complaining that this Order restricting his 15 extrajudicial statements in this case, was not intended to 17 respond, and that's on page one of his memo.

18 The Order was issued because of the Defendant's 19 persistent and escalating rhetoric aimed at participants in 20 this proceeding. And the Order was intended to prevent the 21 Defendant from attacking witnesses in this case and jurors 22 in the case and others. 23 He has already been found by the Court to have 24 violated the Order nine times, and he has done it again 25 here.

7 let you know which one I am speaking about as I am speaking 8 about it. 9 THE COURT: I agree you shouldn't play the video.

10 You can give me the exact language and why you think it is 16 allow everyone to attack him, but not to allow him to 1806 1 With respect to the first violation, I am going 2 to talk about, this is, actually, the second violation on 3 the Order to Show Cause that we handed up. It's Exhibit F 4 in the April 25th Affirmation.

5 And I will just start by reading it. The 6 Defendant said the following:
10 That jury was picked so fast, 95 percent 11 Democrats. The area is mostly all Democrat. You think of 12 it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It is a very unfair 13 situation, that I can tell you. 14 This was just hours before he had a hearing here 15 related to his previous violations. 16 He was on the media, and he used his platform 17 there to criticize the seated jury in this case. There is 18 no inference needed. It is not just any jurors, it is 19 these jurors, in this case, sitting right in this room in a 20 few minutes. 21 His contrived justification in his papers is 22 that, well, the media was saying some of what I am saying. 23 That's a little bit like his re-posting argument, except 24 weaker.

25 The Defendant saying anything amplifies it and 7 But this Judge said that I can't get away from 8 the trial. You know, he is rushing the trial like crazy. 9 Nobody has ever seen a thing like this.

1807 1 creates an air of menace that is substantially different 2 from a media report. By talking about the jury at all, he 3 places this process and this proceeding here in jeopardy. 4 That is what the Order forbids, and he did it 6 I will move on to the second violation that we 7 are alleging, and it is actually the fourth in the Order to 8 Show Cause. It's Exhibit H in the Affirmation that we 9 filed on the 25th.

10 That statement was made on the morning of the 11 25th. So, on his way down here for the hearing at some 12 kind of a press event, I think at 49th and Fifth Avenues in 13 Manhattan. And the Defendant was out, and there were 14 reporters around who were asking him questions. I think 15 that was all part of the plan. 16 And one of the questions, and I will read now the 17 question, and then the defendant's statement.

18 The question was, what have you thought of David 19 Pecker's testimony so far? When was the last time you 20 spoke to him? 21 The defendant's answer was, he has been very 22 nice. I mean, he has been -- David's been very nice, a 23 nice guy. This is a classic carrot stick. 24 First of all, there is no question that there was 25 a witness in the proceeding because the witness was going 5 anyway.

1808 1 to be testifying a hour or two after the Defendant made 2 that statement. 3 As I said the other day, the Defendant knows what 4 he is doing. He talks about the testifying witness, says 5 nice things, does it in front of the cameras. 6 To be clear, he was asked other questions about 13 Pecker, be nice. Everyone is hearing this. I 14 have a platform, and I will talk about you, so be nice.

15 What the defense counsel described as innocuous 16 statements about Mr. Pecker on page five of their memo, is 17 anything but. They are deliberate shots across the bow to 18 everyone that may come to this courtroom to tell the truth 19 about the Defendant and what he did.

20 Moving on to the third statement that I will talk 21 about, which this time it is also the third statement in 22 the Order to Show Cause, and it's Exhibit G in the 23 Affirmation that I filed. 24 This is from an interview that the Defendant gave 25 to a Pennsylvania TV station on the morning of Tuesday, 7 this case and ignored them. So this was not just the 8 Defendant responding to everything the reporters were 9 asking him. He selectively responded to this question and 10 not others. 11 The one he answered was about the witness who was 12 testifying. It was deliberate, and it was calculating.

1809 1 April 23rd. It didn't actually air until that evening, and 2 the statement is as follows: 3 Well, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar, and he 4 has got no credibility whatsoever. He was a lawyer and you 11 anything wrong with that, with the charges that they made, 12 but what he did is -- is he did some pretty bad things, I 13 guess, with banking or whatever. If it was a personal 14 thing to him.

15 David Pecker, I don't know exactly what he's 16 going to be testifying against but -- or about. He will be 17 testifying today.

18 Again, no question this is related to this 19 proceeding. The Defendant is talking about two witnesses, 20 one of whom was on the stand at the time in the middle of 21 testimony.

22 It's clearly willful, clearly knowing. 23 The Defendant thinks the rules should be 24 different for him. I talked a bit about the impact of 25 comments about a testifying witness, perhaps not on that 5 rely on your lawyers. But Michael Cohen was a convicted 6 lawyer. He was a lawyer for many people, not just me, and 7 he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did 8 for me. 9 Largely, it was essentially all because of what 10 he did in terms of the campaign. I don't think there was 1810 1 witness, but on other witnesses. It is an insidious thing.

2 I will talk a little bit more about Michael Cohen 3 in a moment. 4 Moving to the -- and, again, in that statement he 5 is talking both about Michael Cohen and his credibility, 6 which is a theme here, and then about David Pecker, who is 7 the witness on the stand. 8 Finally, I will move on to the first statement in 9 the Order to Show Cause, which is Exhibit E from the April 10 25th Affirmation. That was made also on April 22nd, 11 earlier in the day than the statement I just talked about.

12 And I know I said this the other day, that this 20 excerpts:
24 it a payment to a lawyer because, as you know, Cohen is a 25 lawyer, represented a lot of people over the years.

13 statement was made right outside of these doors, the doors 14 of this courtroom in the little pen that's set up where he 15 speaks to the gathered media everyday. 16 He stood there for almost nine minutes and he 17 talked about a prospective witness that was going to be in 18 this courtroom at some date in the future, Michael Cohen. 19 What he said was, and it's two different 21 But, they called the payment to a lawyer a legal 22 expense in the books. They didn't call it construction. 23 They didn't say you are building a building. They called 1811 1 I am not the only one and wasn't very good in a 2 lot of ways in terms of his representation, but he 3 represented a lot of people.

6 indicted for that.

10 He got caught lying in the last trial. He got 11 caught lying, pure lying. And when are they going to look 12 at that? 13 This and all of these are clearly related to this 14 proceeding. They are clearly willful. The Defendant is 15 talking about witnesses and the jury in this case, one 16 right here outside the door, all during the trial.

17 This is the most critical time, the time the 18 proceeding needs to be protected, where -- particularly 19 where Defendant has demonstrated over time, and recently, 20 his willingness to say and do anything he can to try to 21 infect and disrupt this process. That's what the Defendant 22 has tried to do and continues to try to do. 23 We understand the Court's concern about Michael 24 Cohen, but in the statements at issue here, the Defendant 25 wasn't responding to anything in particular. He talks 4 But, he puts in an invoice, or whatever, a bill, 5 and they pay, and they call it a legal expense. I got 7 Later the Defendant went on, quote, and when are 8 they going to look at all the lines that Cohen did in the 9 last trial?

1812 1 about things Michael Cohen has said in the weeks and months 2 before defendant's statements at issue here. 3 There is mention of TikToks more recently, and 4 now, I will talk about the exhibits, the 50-plus exhibits, 5 500 pages of documents that were filed with Defense papers. 6 But, there is nothing to indicate that the 7 Defendant saw those statements when they were made. This 8 Order has only been in effect for four to five weeks, not 9 months.

25 We have to show a violation of that Order, and 10 Michael Cohen is not a political opponent. 11 Defendant's comments about Michael Cohen relate to issues 12 at the heart of this proceeding and Michael Cohen's 13 participation in the proceeding. 14 They don't relate to political policies or goals 15 of the Defendant. The Defendant is doing everything he can 16 to make this case and the proceeding about his politics.

17 It's not. It's about his criminal conduct.

18 His statements are corrosive to this proceeding 19 and to the fair administration of justice.

20 As your Honor knows, we just did this the other 21 day. What we have to prove here is the existence of a 22 lawful Order expressing an ongoing mandate, which I submit 23 is very clear here based on the Court's previous decision 24 and other litigation on this very issue.

1813 3 reasonable doubt. 4 I would remind the Court that on Monday, 22 decision the other day. 23 Based on the comments themselves, the timing, and 24 even for the one comment, the location, I submit that we 25 have met our burden and established that the Defendant 5 April 23rd, Mr. Blanche in court with the Defendant sitting 6 right next to him, said the following about the defendant's 7 knowledge of the Order, and this is from the transcript on 8 April 23rd, page 964, line 10 to 15: 9 There is, just to set the record very straight 10 and clear, President Trump does, in fact, know what the Gag 11 Order allows him to do and not allow him to do. And there 12 was absolutely no willful violation of the Gag Order in the 13 ten posts released by the campaign or what the People just 14 discussed.

15 THE COURT: What was the page number on that? 16 MR. CONROY: Sorry. That was Page 964, 17 April 23rd, lines 10 to 15.

18 THE COURT: Thank you. 19 MR. CONROY: Again, the existence of a lawful 20 Order, I don't think is at issue at all. There has been 21 plenty of litigation on that. The Court issued the 1 that's what we have just gone through. And we have to show 2 that it is made with knowledge, and it is willful beyond a 1814 4 We are asking the Court, again, to impose the 5 maximum $1,000 fine for each of the four violations. 6 Because each of these statements was made before 1 willfully and knowingly violated the lawful Order of this 2 Court on each of the four occasions that I have just went 3 through. 7 the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this 8 Order nine previous times, and because we prefer to 9 minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet 10 seeking jail. But the Court's decision this past Tuesday 11 will inform the approach we take to any future violations.

12 We are happy to answer any questions. 13 Thank you. 14 THE COURT: None at this time. Thank you.

15 Mr. Blanche. 16 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

17 So, part of my argument this morning does react 18 to the Court's Order on Tuesday, from April 30th. And 19 while we disagree with the Court's Order, to some context, 20 we are guided this morning in what I am going to say to the 21 Court by what the Court said to us on Tuesday.

22 First, the purpose of the Gag Order, your Honor, 23 is to restrict extrajudicial statements in Order to protect 24 the integrity of these proceedings by shielding those 25 fearful of reprisal by the Defendant so that they may take 1815 1 part in these proceedings without concern.

2 And as I will get to in a few minutes, your 3 Honor, that concept alone is reason enough to deny the four 4 that we are here about this morning.

5 And I know that the Court has stated repeatedly 6 that the Gag Order, and your Honor's intention is not to 7 allow unfettered attacks on President Trump, recognizing he 16 responses to political attacks does not violate the Gag 17 Order.

18 And I disagree with the People. I disagree that 19 the time that we start looking at what President Trump is 20 responding directly to is the day of the Gag Order. 21 Since President Trump announced his candidacy to 22 run for election this November in '22, almost two years 23 ago, there have been multiple and repeated attacks on him 24 from, among other people, Michael Cohen, and folks that 25 Michael Cohen has on his podcast regularly.

8 is running for President. Doing a campaign every day, part 9 of the campaign takes place outside of this courtroom, part 10 of the campaign takes place in interviews, meetings with 11 potential voters, whether there is press present and on the 12 campaign trail, and your Honor said it again in the Order 13 on Tuesday. 14 And there is no dispute, I think, among anybody, 15 the Court, or the Government, that political attacks and 1816 1 Again, to talk -- I will get more into this in a 2 minute from our exhibits, your Honor, to talk not only 3 about these proceedings, and not only about Mr. Cohen's 4 credibility, and not only attacking President Trump's 5 credibility, but also attacking him running for President, 6 the qualities he would bring as a leader of this nation and 7 reflecting on the presidency four years ago. 8 THE COURT: If I can make a suggestion, Mr. 9 Blanche.

10 My main concern is the conduct that took place 11 after the Gag Order was implemented.

12 I looked at the exhibits that you provided. If 13 you want to go through some of them, that's fine, but it's 14 500 pages.

15 MR. BLANCHE: I am not going through all of them, 16 Judge, of course not.

17 THE COURT: Just, as you know, it's not going to 18 weigh very heavily on my decision if you refer to exhibits 19 a year ago or two years ago before the Gag Order was in 20 place.

23 In response to the Court's Order on Tuesday, and 24 in preparation for our hearing today, we are prepared to 25 pass up some additional exhibits. And the only exhibits I
21 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, it is not my intention 22 to do that. We will get to that in a minute.

1817 1 am referring to today, I believe, are recent, recent 2 exhibits that bear on the four charged counts. 3 But, Judge, I -- I do think it's appropriate when 4 the Court's considering whether there has been a willful 5 violation of the Gag Order beyond a reasonable doubt, to 6 keep in perspective beyond just the Gag Order, your Honor 7 did that in reaching the conclusions. 8 That's what I am talking about today. That's it. 9 THE COURT: I am telling you what I am going to 10 consider when I make my decision. You can do that. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, last weekend -- last 12 weekend, President Trump's rival, President Biden, said in 13 a public forum, he talked about this trial, and he talked 14 about a witness that's going to be in this trial.

18 Okay. President Trump can't respond to that in 19 the way that he would want to because of this Gag Order.

20 Stormy weather, as everyone -- 21 THE COURT: Where --
22 MR. BLANCHE: It's one of our exhibits, your 23 Honor. 24 Stormy weather was an obvious reference to Stormy 25 Daniels.

15 He mocked President Trump. 16 He said, Donald has had a few tough days lately.

17 You might call it stormy weather.

1818 1 THE COURT: You are saying that he can't respond 2 to what President Biden said without saying Stormy, Stormy 3 Daniels? 4 MR. BLANCHE: That's exactly what I am saying.

5 He cannot respond without saying Stormy Daniels, 6 your Honor. He is not allowed to.

7 THE COURT: No, he is not allowed to refer to a 24 offer, and they are Exhibit 61 through 126.

25 These exhibits are mostly tweets or re-tweets by 8 foreseeable witness in the case. He is certainly allowed 9 to respond to something said by President Biden. There is 10 nothing in the Gag Order that says he can't. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I am not saying that he 12 is not allowed to respond to President Biden, but he is 13 limited in what he can say. President Biden is not 14 limited.

15 So, President Biden can make a reference to this 16 trial and to a witness in this trial. President Trump can 17 respond about certain parts of this trial and, your Honor, 18 that's just my opening point. That that happened this past 19 weekend is to give context to the four statements, which is 20 the reason why we are here today. 21 In addition to the exhibits that were attached on 22 Monday evening, your Honor, we are also going to hand up to 23 the Court and the Government shortly exhibits we will 1 Michael Cohen recently, certain Mea Culpa Podcasts, recent 2 ones, and I don't believe every one since the Gag Order, 3 but recently, and then certain video transcripts from news 4 programs regarding Mr. Pecker's testimony, the jury 5 composition and Mr. Cohen himself.

22 the Gag Order if they didn't need to be protected. That's 23 the reason that we are coming at it late, your Honor.

25 and talk about Mr. Pecker, the alleged violation regarding 1819 6 And I am not going to go through all of them. I
7 am going to highlight a few of them, before I offer them 8 up, and I also -- I have a thumb drive with all of them. 9 THE COURT: Okay.

10 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you. 11 (Whereupon, documents and a thumb drive were 12 handed to the Court and the People.) 13 THE COURT: Is there a reason why this wasn't 14 provided before when you submitted your answering papers?

15 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 16 THE COURT: What's that?

17 MR. BLANCHE: The additional exhibits are in 18 response, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, to Your Honor's 19 Order on Tuesday, because your Honor made plain in the 20 Order recognizing that there would be opportunity, and it 21 may be necessary to allow -- to remove certain people from 24 So I am going to go in a little bit reverse Order 1820 1 statements about Mr. Pecker.

2 So what President Trump said, David Pecker, I 3 don't know exactly what he is going to be testifying about, 4 but he will be testifying today.

5 So, that was a recording, as the Government just 6 said, on April 23rd, for a news show in Philadelphia. It 7 aired about six o'clock that evening. 8 That was in response to a question from the 9 interviewer saying, where is your concern level at this 19 decades. He is talking about a man who he was friends with 20 for decades. 21 There is no threat. There is no threat in what 22 President Trump said, and we cited ten. There are multiple 23 articles. We cited ten of them in our papers, news 24 articles that are going into excruciating details about Mr.

25 Pecker's testimony.

10 point regarding David Pecker's testimony and Michael Cohen, 11 but focusing on David Pecker for now?

12 Where is your concern level? 13 President Trump sidestepped the question. He 14 gave a very factual, truthful answer. It wasn't a warning.

15 It wasn't a commentary on what Mr. Pecker had testified 16 about, and, certainly, it was not a willful violation.

17 I mean, he is -- he is talking, as the Court 18 knows from the testimony, about a man that he has known for 1 So, when you have President Trump in response to 2 a question saying something completely neutral about the 3 witnesses, there is -- that's not a willful violation of 23 THE COURT: When you say, behind us? 24 MR. BLANCHE: I am talking about the press and 25 the fact that there is 24/7 coverage of everything that's 8 about what all the other witnesses who may come here see. 9 If the witnesses were to see Mr. Trump speaking about 10 Mr. Pecker, or even Mr. Cohen, it affects those witnesses 11 as well.

12 And that's why I understand your concern of Mr. 13 Cohen, I expressed concerns about Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels 14 in my decision. And those are valid. I get it.

15 But it's not just about those individuals. 16 It's about what everybody else, the jurors, and 17 all of the other witnesses see Mr. Trump saying or not 18 saying about other witnesses, and that's a concern. 19 That does go to the integrity of the proceedings.

20 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, as applied to this case 21 and this trial and what's happening behind us, that's the 22 reasons why this Gag Order isn't fair.

4 the Gag Order, when the intent of the Gag Order is to make 5 sure that Mr. Pecker comes in here and testifies without 6 fear of what President Trump has said or will say.

7 THE COURT: It's not just about Mr. Pecker. It's 1821 1822 1 happening in this courtroom and everything that the 2 witnesses are saying. 3 And, so, every time we whisper to our client, 4 it's live-streamed over all sorts of social media outlets, 5 every word the witnesses say, and so then you have 6 President Trump who is asked a question.

11 comment, repeatedly when he is running for President, and I
12 appreciate the Court's concern, very much so. 13 And we are reacting to what your Honor wrote on 14 Tuesday, but it's also appropriate to turn to what's 15 happening with this trial. 16 THE COURT: What's happening in this trial is no 17 surprise to anyone. I mean, the former President of the 18 United States is on trial. 19 He is the leading candidate for the Republican 20 Party right now. It's not surprising that we have press 21 here. We have press in the overflow room. There are 22 people throughout New York that are interested. 23 Everybody that came into this knew this would 24 happen. We all suspected it. There are no surprises here.

25 So, I don't see how it would press on Mr. Trump 7 Everybody is talking about it. What do you think 8 of his testimony, and he doesn't say, I think he is a liar. 9 He better watch out.

10 He says something. He can't just say, no 1823 1 if ten outlets are talking about Mr. Pecker.

2 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, the reason for the Order -- 3 the reason for the Order is to make sure that witnesses 4 that are going to come in here and testify, are going to do 5 so honestly and without fear of reprisal. 6 And my point in reflecting on the intense 7 scrutiny of every word said by every witness, is that 8 everybody can say whatever they want, except for President 9 Trump.

10 THE COURT: They are not -- they are not 11 defendants in this case. They are not subject to the Gag 12 Order. 13 That's a very significant issue that you are 14 overlooking. I don't have authority over the press.

15 I don't have authority over most of the people 16 that are saying things.

17 I couldn't possibly extend a Gag Order to them.

18 I just don't have that authority. So, I don't see the 19 comparison.

20 I don't see the analogy between comparing your 21 client, who is the Defendant, and who is subject to the Gag 22 Order, with ten members of the press who wrote an article. 23 MR. BLANCHE: I am not asking your Honor for an 24 analogy. I am not comparing one to the other.

25 I am saying that when your Honor is considering 1824 1 whether President Trump has willfully violated the Gag 2 Order beyond a reasonable doubt, it makes sense, the Court 3 has to look at what all the press and all the media and 4 what Mr. Pecker was reading about his statements.

5 And so, when you look at what President Trump 6 said about his statements, it does matter. It matters to 7 the willfulness and it matters to whether the reason for 8 the Gag Order is -- 9 THE COURT: If I may, I would like to ask you a 10 question, and this has to do with what you are talking 11 about.

12 If we look at the first exhibit, I don't remember 13 the exhibit letter, so I will call it number one, when 14 those statements were made, it was your client who went 15 down to that open area and stood in front of the press and 16 started to speak.

17 It wasn't the press that went to him. He went to 18 the press. He didn't need to go in that direction. The 19 door that he uses is to the right.

20 So you are telling me that, you know, the 21 scrutiny is outrageous. Nobody forced your client to go 22 stand where he did that day. 23 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, I agree with that, but two 24 responses.

25 One, there is a much different reason with 1825 1 respect to Mr. Cohen, which I will get to in a minute.

2 And two, nobody is forcing him, but he is running 3 for President. He has to be able to speak. 4 So, your Honor is right. He can walk out there 5 and go right or he can walk out there and go left and make 6 a statement which he is entitled to do and has to do, your 7 Honor.

10 that.

9 THE COURT: That's why he is being allowed to do 11 That's why that entire area has been setup the 12 way that it is setup, to ensure that your client, as a 13 candidate for presidency, has the opportunity to speak 14 about absolutely anything he wants, including the District 15 Attorney of New York County. But there are just some 16 things he cannot talk about.

17 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I am going to talk 18 about Mr. Cohen in a minute. 19 I want to address, briefly, the second Pecker 20 statement, which is Exhibit H to the People's Affirmation. 21 And this statement is -- President Trump is asked 22 the question, what have you thought of David Pecker's 23 testimony so far? 24 When was the last time you spoke to him?

25 President Trump said, he has been very nice. I
8 So we are not --
1826 1 mean, he has been -- David's been very nice, a nice guy.

2 And, again, he is responding to a question. 3 Mr. Pecker had been on the stand for two days at 4 this point. The Government says that that's threatening 5 and a warning to witnesses that they need to be nice. 6 That's just not true. He is just responding to a 7 question and saying he has been very nice.

11 Again, Mr. Pecker himself testified about their 12 friendship and the relationship, and he would call him 13 Donald and that he had a great relationship with President 14 Trump over the years.

15 And we, again, put multiple articles in front of 16 the Court, again, not to compare, or not to say that that 17 alone gives President Trump the right to say something, but 18 when the Court is considering whether the purpose of the 19 Gag Order was frustrated by, he has been very nice. I
20 mean, he has been -- David's been very nice, it does 21 matter.

22 THE COURT: Just to save you time, I am not 23 terribly concerned with that one.

8 Your Honor observed his testimony. There is no 9 animosity between the two of them. There were no 10 threatening or menacing statements.

24 I think that there are situations where comments 25 like that could be of much greater concern.

1827 1 At this moment, based on what I saw and heard, I
2 am not terribly concerned. 3 MR. BLANCHE: I will stop with that. I will talk 4 about Mr. Cohen and the Defendant.

5 Judge, there are two statements the Government 6 read. One was outside of the courtroom and one in response 7 to an interview. 8 Again, the second one was on April 23rd. And, 9 Judge, Mr. Cohen, and I am going to spend a few minutes on 10 this because it's extremely important, in my view the most 11 significant one, has been inviting and almost daring 12 President Trump to respond to everything he has been 13 saying. 14 Again, personal attacks on his character, mocking 15 him for being on trial and also his candidacy for 16 Presidency of the United States.

17 So I just want to put a few up on the screen.

18 THE COURT: Very quickly, please. I want you to 19 make your argument.

20 MR. BLANCHE: Sure. 21 So, Exhibit 39, this goes to Mr. Cohen mocking 22 President Trump on X. 23 If we can go to page two and then six and seven, 24 just very quickly. We can -- if we can blow it up a little 25 bit.

1828 1 For the record, it has a photo of President Trump 2 in an orange jumpsuit with a picture next to Nelson 3 Mandela, and it's just a long repost by Mr. Cohen 4 criticizing President Trump.

5 And then we can turn to page six and page seven. 6 And, again --
7 THE COURT: What was the date on that? 8 MR. BLANCHE: That date, your Honor, should be up 9 at the top.

10 April 8th of this year, your Honor. 11 And then pages six and seven, it's more of the 12 same. If we can focus on the date, please, at the top, 13 April 14th. 14 And, again, keep messing with me Donald, and I
15 won't send any money to your commissary, a comment by 16 Mr. Cohen. And then something obnoxious.

17 And then on page seven, at the top with the date 18 first, please. 19 And this is on April 16th, please don't forget 20 about the witnesses. We also matter. Reposting a photo of 21 President Trump.

22 Next, if we can turn to Exhibit 64, quickly, 23 please. And this one, Mr. Cohen -- this one says, oh my, 24 shits in pants. Keep whining and crying and violating the 25 Gag Order, you petulant Defendant.

1829 1 This was sent after the Gag Order was put in 2 place.

## 3 Exhibit 67, Please.

4 Again, from Mr. Cohen criticizing, again, your 5 attacks on me stink of desperation. We are all hoping that 6 you take the stand in your Defense, with a picture of 7 President Trump in this courtroom. And, again, that is on 8 April 22nd. 9 And then, finally, Exhibit 110.

10 Again, this is -- this is before the Gag Order, 11 your Honor, April 4th. But, again, this is not necessarily 12 Mr. Cohen criticizing President Trump about this trial, but 13 about his business and his business ventures, your Honor. 14 So, again, there is a lot more. We picked four 15 out of a hat. They are all in kind and all similar. 16 So, the response -- and now we are here again on 17 a violation of the Gag Order as it relates to Mr. Cohen, 18 these are responses to repeated and consistent attacks by 19 him against President Trump, his character, his viability 20 as a candidate. And, as you can see, your Honor, it's also 21 completely throughout the Mea Culpa Podcast and on TikTok.

22 There are repeated attacks on President Trump's 23 candidacy for President by Mr. Cohen. 24 And if we can go to page -- Exhibit 63, excuse 25 me, and page two, this is -- he is not just doing it to 1830 1 attack.

2 I mean, there are repeated reports and, indeed, 3 they are true, that Mr. Cohen has been shopping television 4 shows based upon, not only what he did for President Trump, 5 but also what he has been doing here. And he is talking 6 about that and advertising what he is trying to do.

7 And then, again, there is multiple examples of 8 this in our exhibits. 9 If we can bring up page 37 -- Exhibit 37, page 10 seven, this is an April 12th, political article quoting 11 Mr. Cohen, talking extensively about President Trump's 12 candidacy for President, criticizing him, as someone that 13 should not be voted for. 14 On the same article, next page, it says, Donald 15 does not know how to tell the truth. He lied so many 16 times. He can't keep track of the lies.

17 And then just, very briefly, your Honor, and I
18 hope the point has been made, but we -- 19 THE COURT: You made your point. You made your 20 point. 21 MR. BLANCHE: Well, okay.

22 But, I mean, on top of everything that I just put 23 in, there is multiple examples of the Mea Culpa Podcast 24 that are over the top, about his character, about his 25 candidacy for President, including multiple interviews with 1831 1 folks in this room, with reporters, who just blast 2 President Trump from what he did as President, and what he 3 would do if he is elected in November. 4 Multiple. I am not talking about one or two. I
5 am talking multiple, in excess of ten, way in excess of 6 ten.

7 Finally, as has been reported, because it's true, 8 Mr. Cohen has started going on TikTok nightly and literally 9 making money.

10 So, there is, apparently, a way you can make 11 money with people doing things, while they are watching you 12 on TikTok. He actively encourages folks to give him money. 13 You can see that he has made money.

24 questions from the interviewer. He wasn't talking about 25 his testimony at this trial.

14 His TikTok repeatedly criticizes President Trump.

15 He said, as recently as April 29th, mocking and 16 almost poking President Trump as it relates to the Gag 17 Order, I am not the Defendant in a criminal matter, and I
18 am not the subject of Judge Merchan's Gag Order. Donald 19 is, right.

20 And that is after criticizing him extensively. 21 This is not a man that needs protection from the 22 Gag Order. And when you look at what President Trump said 23 about Michael Cohen out here, and then in response to the 1832 1 He was talking about his quality as a lawyer. He 2 was talking about the fact that he was a convicted liar, 3 that he had been prosecuted for lying. 4 THE COURT: Can I ask you to address the comments 5 that were made about the jury? 6 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. That was my last.

7 So, the Government read the statement that -- it 8 was a 15-second statement out of an interview that was over 9 21-minutes long.

10 And this was right in the middle of the interview 11 in response to a number of questions about -- at first 23 THE COURT: Did he violate the Gag Order?

25 MR. BLANCHE: I am making an argument that he 16 As you know, your Honor is very well aware, we 17 very much believe that this is a political persecution and 18 this is a political trial. And part of that belief and 19 part of President Trump's belief is the location of this 20 trial. 21 The fact that he is being tried in a jurisdiction 22 that is over 90 or -- 24 That's all I want to know.

12 about policy. And we can exclude the entire interview, but 13 the policy, first about the types of questions that 14 mattered to voters. But this trial matters to voters, so 15 there was a question about this trial.

1833 1 didn't and laying the foundation.

4 MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely, positively not.

5 THE COURT: He spoke about the jury, right? 6 MR. BLANCHE: Pardon me.

7 THE COURT: And he said that the jury was 8 95 percent Democrats. And that the jury had been rushed 9 through. And the implication being that this is not a fair 10 jury. 11 That's the implication that was given to anybody 12 that heard that comment. This is not a fair jury. 13 MR. BLANCHE: The Gag Order specifically 16 So, he wasn't referencing juror number four is a 17 Democrat or -- which by the way, the press has noted and 18 the press has highlighted. And the press has put on the 19 screens who is democrat and who is not registered.

20 Again, he is talking about, again, in a passing 21 phrase, about the overall proceedings being unfair and 22 political. The jury -- 23 THE COURT: Okay. It's ten after ten. 24 Is there anything you would like to say just to 25 wrap it up?

2 THE COURT: So, I am not accepting your argument, 3 which is why I am asking.

14 references any prospective juror or any juror in this 15 criminal proceeding.

1834 1 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, again, we moved to the jury, 2 and I am done with Mr. Cohen. 3 But Mr. Cohen, and the same things in our papers 4 with respect to Ms. Daniels, where, when you go back, the 5 Court goes back and looks at the purpose of the Gag Order, 8 I mean, the Constitutional limits that you put on 9 the Gag Order, that your Honor put on the Gag Order, are 10 for good reasons. 11 Because President Trump has to be able to talk 12 extensively and to respond to questions in a way that don't 13 violate the integrity of these proceedings. 14 And as we said today, Mr. Cohen should not be 15 part of this Gag Order. He does not need to be protected. 16 The same is true for Ms. Daniels. She is not 17 part of the four statements, but she is very similar, 18 although not as voluminous, comments about President Trump 19 personal, candidacy for Presidency and how he was president 20 last time. 21 They are not people that need to be protected, 22 and to the contrary, he has to be able to respond to those, 23 Judge. 24 THE COURT: I understand your argument.

25 Thank you.

6 as opposed to just blindly looking at the statements that 7 are made by President Trump, it's not violating.

1835 1 Is there anything else on this point from either 2 side? 3 MR. STEINGLASS: No.

5 bring the jury in.

7 THE COURT: I think we can get the witness back 8 on the stand, please.

15 K E I T H D A V I D S O N, 16 herein, called as a witness, being previously sworn, was 17 examined and testified further as follows:

17 Q What is your understanding of what this email was 18 about? 19 A This email followed a conversation, a conference call, 20 between Dylan and I with Michael Cohen. That conversation took 21 place because there was difficulty in communications with 22 Michael Cohen, and I -- and I had lost trust in what he was 23 telling me. 24 And Dylan came in as the mediator and sort of mediated 25 that meeting, and he followed up with this email.

1838 1 Q What was the reason for losing trust with Michael 2 Cohen? 3 A I believed he was not telling me the truth. 4 Q About what?

5 A Delays, the delays in the funding. 6 Q Okay. I now want to show you Exhibit 285 in evidence, 7 and I am going to blow it up, and ask you, is this another 8 email exchange between yourself and Michael Cohen?

11 A Wire on behalf of Essential Consultants LLC.

12 Q And what is the date of this email? 13 A October 27, 2016. 14 Q And does it appear as though, if you were going 15 chronologically, it would start at the bottom and go up? 16 A Yes.

22 Q We can show you the Bates stamp and see if this helps 23 you to answer the question. 24 A Yes, it was produced by me pursuant to subpoena.

25 Q Okay. So, now I am just going to ask you, what does 10 Q And what is the subject line of the email?

9 A Yes.

1839 1 the body of the first email in the chain from Michael Cohen to 2 you say? 3 A Keith. 4 Next paragraph.

15 Q And did you respond? 16 A Yes.

17 Q At what time?

18 A 7:02 p.m. 19 Q And how did you respond?

20 A I confirmed that I will work in good faith, and that 21 no funds shall be disbursed, unless and until he personally 24 settlement DOCs will name the correct corporation, parentheses, 25 Essential Consultants LLC, end parentheses.

10 Q Okay. At that time, was the entity that Michael Cohen 11 was using to fund this deal called Resolution Consultants?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And at some point between then and the final 14 documents, did the entity name change?

15 A It did. 16 Q And what did it change to?

17 A Essential Consultants LLC.

18 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan 19 Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court 20 Reporter, Lisa Kramsky.) 21 22 23 24 25 8 October 11th of 2016?

1841 1 (The following proceedings are continued from the 2 following page.) 3 ******** 4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 5 BY MR. STEINGLASS:
11 A Yes. 17 Q Did you have an understanding as to who told Dylan 18 Howard that the funds had been wired? 19 A I -- I assumed that it was Michael Cohen. He was the 20 only other one involved. 21 Q And what about your response? 22 A "Funds received." 23 Q And did you, in fact, receive these funds as a wire 24 from Essential Consultants on October 27th, 2016 into your 25 escrow account?

6 Q I now want to pull back up Exhibit 176-A, which is in 7 evidence, and display Page 12, Lines 536 to 537. 8 Is this a part of that long series of texts between yourself 9 and Dylan Howard?

10 (Displayed.) 12 Q And are these two that we've blown up, what is the date 13 on these texts? 14 A October 27th, 2016. 15 Q What do the texts say? 16 A From Dylan Howard to me: "Money wired I am told."
1842 1 A Yes.

2 Q Turning to Page 13. Just to continue this text 3 exchange. 4 What, if anything, did Mr. Howard say? 5 (Displayed.) 6 A "Unbelievable." 7 Q And you? 8 A "Was never really sure..." 9 Q And did Stormy Daniels have to re-sign the original 10 Settlement Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement now that the 11 name of the entity that was funding the deal had been changed 12 from Resolution Consultants to Essential Consultants? 13 A She did. 14 Q I'm now showing you what's in evidence as People's 17 Q Do you recognize these documents?

18 A Yes. 19 Q What are they? 20 A This looks to be the cover page, Page 1, of the 21 confidential Settlement Agreement & Mutual Release Assignment of 22 copyright and Non-Disparagement Agreement between -- relating to 23 Stormy Daniels. 24 Q And whom? 25 A Donald Trump.

16 (Displayed.) 15 Exhibit 276.

1843 1 Q And were you involved in drafting these Agreements?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Did the Settlement Agreement, the ultimate Settlement 4 Agreement payment amount remain $130,000 in this final version? 9 Q And I am just going to ask you to read that aloud and 10 then tell us what it means, please? 11 (Pause.)
12 A You said you wanted me to read it? 13 Q Yes, please. 14 A Aloud?

15 Q Please. 16 A Paragraph D: "PP shall not" -- plaintiff shall not --
17 at any time from the date of this Agreement forward, comma, 18 directly or indirectly disclose or disseminate any of the 19 property or any confidential information, parenthesis, 20 (including confirmation of the fact that it exists or ever 21 existed and/or confirming any rumors as to any such existence),
22 end parenthesis, to any party, as more fully provided herein. 23 Q Does it say "to any third party?" 24 A "Any third party."
25 Q Okay. And what does that mean?

5 A It did. 6 MR. STEINGLASS: I want to display Page 3 and blow 7 up Paragraph 3.1D. 8 (Displayed.)
1844 1 A That's essentially part of the nondisclosure aspect of 2 the Agreement. 3 Q And I believe you told us yesterday, is "PP" the 4 pseudonym Peggy Peterson for Stormy Daniels? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Okay. 7 MR. STEINGLASS: I want to turn to Page 10 and 11 Q What -- I'm not going to ask you to read this whole 12 thing out loud. 16 A I'm familiar with it. I authored this paragraph. 17 Q Okay. So what does it mean?

18 A It's the Liquidated Damages Provision. 19 Q And does the Liquidated Damages Provision continue onto 20 the next page? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Okay. I am just going to quickly show you that last 23 page. 24 (Displayed.) 25 Q What was the -- what were the liquidated damages in 8 blow up Paragraph 5.1.2. 9 This is on Page 9 of the Settlement Agreement.

10 (Displayed.) 13 Can you just read it to yourself and let us know when you're 14 done reading it. 15 The question I'm going to ask you is what it means?

1845 1 this case?

2 A The stated liquidated damages in this contract was 3 $1 million dollars. 4 Q And is that $1 million dollars per breach? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Was it unusual to have liquidated damages that were so 7 much greater than the original payment under the NDA? 8 A I believe that this paragraph, the way that it was 9 drafted, was unenforceable; yes.

10 Q You believe it was unenforceable; why? 11 A I -- because the Liquidated Damages Provision would 12 have no relation to the damages caused if there was a breach. 13 The $1 million dollars -- there needs to be a rational 14 relationship between the expected damages in the case of a 15 breach of contract, and the Liquidated Damages Provision are 16 included in contracts where the expected damages, were there to 17 be a breach, would be difficult to ascertain.

18 And they should be reasonably related to the underlying 19 amount of the contract. 20 And, here, a Liquidated Damages Provision of $1 million 21 dollars, which was demanded by Michael Cohen, was so far in 22 excess of the -- of the settlement amount of the contract that 23 it really served no purpose. 24 Q And I believe you answered this, but who requested such 25 large liquidated damages?

1 A Michael Cohen.

1846 2 Q Now, this paragraph that we have blown up refers to 3 "DD."
5 A It's a pseudonym for the defendant. 6 Q And is that a party to this Agreement?

7 A Yes. 8 Q And who is the person who DD refers to? 9 A Donald Trump.

10 Q Okay. 11 MR. STEINGLASS: I now want to display Page 15.

12 (Displayed.) 13 Q And let me know if you need us to blow this up, but I 14 just want to ask you: Who is accepting service on behalf of DD
15 a/k/a David Dennison a/k/a Donald Trump. 16 A Essential Consultants, care of Michael Cohen, Esquire.

17 Q And turning to Page 17 of the exhibit. Is this the 18 first page of the finalized Side Letter Agreement? 19 (Displayed.)
20 A Yes. 21 Q And is the name of -- the real name of David Dennison 22 written in handwriting? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Whose handwriting is that?

25 A My handwriting.

4 Can you remind us what the "DD" stands for again?

1 Q Okay.

1847 2 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we just zoom in on that, 3 please. 4 (Displayed.) 5 Q And what was the date that the Side Letter was entered 6 into? 7 A I would have to look at the signature block. 8 Q Okay. What is the date that is written in the original 9 paragraph of the Side Letter written agreement?

10 A October 28th, 2016. 11 Q Okay. Turning to the next page of the exhibit. Page 12 18. 13 (Displayed.) 14 Q And blowing up the second full paragraph. Can you 15 please read that out loud? 16 A "It is further agreed, neither party shall keep a copy 17 of this document, and that only Keith M. Davidson, Esquire and 18 Michael D. Cohen, Esquire, counsel for the parties herein, shall 19 maintain possession of it or access to this Side Letter 20 Agreement. 21 And then in all caps: "FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT," comma, "THE 22 PARTIES HERETO AGREE AND CONFIRM THAT THIS SIDE LETTER AGREEMENT 23 IS DEEMED," QUOTE, "'ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY,'" END QUOTE. 24 Q And what did you understand that to mean? 25 A That this document was sensitive; that the parties --
1848 1 that neither party could maintain a copy of this Side Letter 2 Agreement, and that only Michael Cohen and I could possess a 3 fully executed copy of it. 4 Q And to be clear, is this the document that decodes, I 5 guess, the Nondisclosure Agreement between Stormy Daniels and 6 Donald Trump? 7 A The Settlement Agreement and Nondisclosure Agreement, 8 yes, this is the Side Letter Agreement that decodes the 9 underlying Settlement Agreement.

10 Q And I should clarify. When I say "decode," I mean 11 provides the real names of the parties to the Settlement 12 Agreement? 13 A True. 14 Q Okay. Turning to the bottom -- the next page. Oh, no, 15 just the bottom of this page. And I will just ask you, who -- 16 if you signed the Agreement? 17 A I did sign the Agreement.

18 Q Silly question, but where? 19 A Above my name. 20 Q On the line above your name? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Who signed on behalf of Peggy Peterson a/k/a Stephanie 23 Gregory Clifford a/k/a Stormy Daniels? 24 A She signed that herself. 25 Q And what was the date that she signed it?

1849 1 A October 28th, 2016.

2 Q What was the date that you signed it? 3 A October 31st, 2016. 4 Q And did -- who signed on behalf of Essential 5 Consultants? 6 A Michael Cohen. 7 Q And what date did he sign? 8 A He wrote that he signed it on October 28th, 2016. 9 Q Did anyone ever -- well, let me ask you this, did you 10 ever receive a version where there was a signature on the line 11 for David Dennison's signature? 12 A I did not. 13 Q Turning to page 19, which is the last page of the 16 What is this? 17 (Displayed.)
18 A This is an Assignment & Transfer of Copyright. It's an 19 addendum to the Settlement Agreement. 20 Q And what does that mean? 21 A A -- copyrights are details of an ownership of some 22 sort of intellectual property, and as a result of the underlying 23 contract, it called for a transfer of copyright in any materials 24 that Stephanie Clifford owned an interest in where she 25 transferred that right to the other party in this Agreement.

14 exhibit. 15 What is this exhibit?

1850 1 MR. STEINGLASS: And if you could blow up the 2 bottom here. 3 (Displayed.) 4 Q Did Stormy Daniels sign the Agreement? 5 A She did. 6 Q Where? 7 A Above the line, her signature line, "PP." 8 Q And what name did she use to sign it? 9 A Stephanie Clifford.

10 Q Who signed the Agreement on behalf of David Dennison? 11 A Michael Cohen, Esquire. 12 Q And is that above the line -- is that the line that we 13 have highlighted above the "DD"? 15 Q Now, did he also place the initials "EC" for Essential 16 Consultants at the bottom of the page over the line for "DD"? 17 A Yes.

18 Q All right. 19 So, Mr. Davidson, how much money did you personally make for 20 this deal? 21 A $10,000. 22 Q Did there come a time when you disbursed the monies 23 that you received in a wire from Michael Cohen on October 27th? 24 A Yes. 25 Q And do you remember how much you disbursed to Stormy 14 A Yes.

1851 1 Daniels, approximately?

2 A (Pause.) I fear that that invades attorney-client 3 privilege. 4 I disbursed everything other than my attorney fees. 5 Q So let me ask you this, did you also, without invading 6 attorney-client privilege, did you also disburse some of the 7 money to Gina Rodriguez? 8 A I disbursed everything to -- pursuant to my client's 9 directives, her net aspect of the settlement pursuant to her 10 directive. 13 and AMI became public? 14 A Yes. 15 Q Do you remember how that happened? 16 A Yes. 17 Q How?

18 A Well, I -- I should clarify. 19 Q Let me ask you that a different way. I don't want to 20 ask you to invade any privilege. 21 Was there an article that was published in a particular 22 publication? 23 A There was an article published in the Wall Street 24 Journal that initially publicized the underlying contract 25 between Karen McDougal and AMI.

11 Q Okay. So directing your attention to November of 2016. 12 Did there come a time when the Agreement between Karen McDougal 1852 1 Q Okay. I want to show you quickly People's 108 in 2 evidence. 4 Q It's in evidence so everybody can see it. Do you 7 Q Is this the Wall Street Journal article that you 8 referenced that broke the story between -- about the deal 10 A It is. 11 Q And what is the date of this article?

12 A November 4th, 2016. 13 Q After this article was published, or around the time 14 the article was published, did you speak with Michael Cohen 15 about it? 16 A I did.

17 Q Once or more than once?

18 A More than once. 19 Q What do you recall about those conversations?

20 A That he was very upset. 21 Q Can you elaborate?

22 A He was very upset that the article had been published. 23 He was very upset about the timing of the article. 24 He wanted to know who the source of the article was; why 25 someone would be the source of this type of an article.

3 (Displayed.)
5 recognize this? 6 A I do.

9 between AMI and Karen McDougal?

1853 1 He was very upset about the timing.

2 He stated that his boss was very upset. 3 And he threatened to sue Karen McDougal. 4 Q And when Michael Cohen said that "his boss was very 5 upset," who did you understand that to mean? 6 A Donald Trump. 7 Q And when Michael Cohen complained about the timing of 8 the article, what did you understand that to mean? 9 A That it was in close proximity to the Election of 2016.

10 Q As you sit here, do you remember the date of Election 11 Day 2016? 12 A It may have been the 6th, I'm not sure. 13 Q Okay. What is your recollection about Karen McDougal's 14 whereabouts at the time that this article was published? 15 If you can answer that without violating privilege? 16 A Yeah, I don't know that I have -- I don't know that I 17 have an answer to that question.

18 Q Okay. 19 A I don't recall. 20 Q So now I want to direct your attention back to People's 21 Exhibit 176A. 22 (Displayed.) 23 Q And this might refresh your recollection as to the date 24 of Election Night. 25 From the context of this -- of the text exchange, can you 1854 4 A November 9th. 5 Q I'm just reminding you about the UTC time. 6 So I think you said you weren't a hundred percent familiar 7 with the relationship between UTC Time and East Coast Time; is 8 that true? 9 A I don't have a particular knowledge of it.

10 Q Okay. And does, in UTC time, was that text sent at 11 approximately 3:00 in the morning? 12 A Yes. 13 Q Okay. And the first text in this exchange is from you; 14 is that correct? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And what did you say? 17 A "What have we done?"
18 Q What did you mean by that, Mr. Davidson? 19 A This was -- this is sort of gallows humor. 20 It was on Election Night as the results were coming in, and 21 there was sort of a surprise amongst the broadcasters and 22 others that Donald Trump was leading in the polls and that there 23 was a growing sense that folks were about ready to call the 24 election. 25 Q And you referred to it as "gallows humor."
1 tell, and keeping in mind that this is in London time, UTC time, 2 can you tell -- does this refresh your recollection about when 3 Election Day was in 2016?

1855 1 Can you explain that a little bit more?

2 What did you mean when you say: "What have we done?" 3 A I think that there was an understanding that this is a 4 text between Dylan Howard and I, and that there was an 5 understanding that our efforts may have in some way -- I should 6 strike that. 7 That our activities may have in some way assisted the 8 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. 9 Q And how did Dylan Howard respond to your text?

10 A "Oh my God." 11 Q After the election -- I should ask you the obvious 12 question: Who won the election? 13 A Donald Trump. 14 Q After the election, did you continue to speak with 15 Michael Cohen? 16 A I did. 17 Q Did -- well, did there come any times during the month 18 or two that followed the election when the topic of the Stormy 19 Daniels deal came up? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Can you tell the jury a little bit about that? 22 A Ummm, after the election, Michael Cohen called me 23 fairly frequently. 24 And there was one particular day, it was on a weekend in 25 mid-December, and this is the period of time after the election, 1856 1 but before Donald Trump had been sworn in as President, and it 2 was -- I think it was on Saturday morning, and I was shopping 3 for the holiday and I got a call from a very despondent and 4 saddened Michael Cohen. 9 And it was a long phone call, and he had told me -- he 10 was -- he was depressed and despondent and he said that -- he 11 used very colorful language about that stage of his life.

12 Q You are quoting so you can repeat the language. 13 A He said something to the effect of: "Jesus Christ. 14 Can you fucking believe I'm not going to Washington. After 15 everything I've done for that fucking guy. I can't believe I'm 16 not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's ass so many 17 times, you don't even know."
18 Q And did -- 19 A And then --
20 Q I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. 21 A And then he made reference to, he said, you know, I
22 never even got paid -- he said: "That fucking guy is not even 23 paying me the 130,000 back." 24 Q And what did you interpret that to mean, that last 25 part?

7 so the whole situation was very odd -- that he was calling me 8 and I was in this strangely-decorated department store.

5 And I was at a department store -- which is kind of a whole 6 another story because it was sort of strangely decorated -- and 1857 1 A That -- that he was not getting repaid the 130,000.

2 Q And do you remember when that conversation took place? 3 A It was some time in mid-December. 4 Q I'm going to show you privately a document. 5 MR. STEINGLASS: And, obviously, show counsel and 8 parties.) 9 Q And I'm going to ask you if this is a receipt from the 10 store that you were shopping in from the time that you got the 11 call from Michael Cohen? 12 A Yes. 13 Q And does that refresh your recollection as to the day 14 you had this particular conversation with Michael Cohen? 15 A Yes. 16 MR. STEINGLASS: And we can take that down. Thank 17 you.

18 Q What was that day? 19 A December 9th. 20 Q And I'm almost afraid to ask this question, but how was 21 the store decorated? 22 A It was this store, I think, that has -- I don't know if 23 it's even in still in business -- but it was a store called -- 24 well, it was a warehouse store, like a big box store, and it 25 had -- it was decorated like Alice In Wonderland, and so you 7 (Displayed only for the previously-described 6 the Court as well.

1858 1 felt very small in it.

2 And there were these huge rabbits and a cat in the hat on 3 the ceiling and things like that. 4 It was just a very odd feeling. 5 Q Okay. So going back to the period of time between the 6 election and the inauguration, during that period did you 7 communicate with Michael Cohen on multiple occasions? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Did you use phone, texts, encrypted apps, or all of the 10 above? 11 A All of the above. 12 Q I am now showing you what's in evidence as People's 13 Exhibit 286. 14 MR. STEINGLASS: And it can be shown to everyone. 15 It's in evidence. 16 (Displayed.) 17 Q And I'm going to direct your attention, I guess, to 18 early 2018 now. 19 Do you recognize this document? 20 A I do. 21 Q And can you explain to the jury what it is, please? 22 A I had received -- I had received a "comment call," 23 which is when the press is about to publish an article. 24 And I had received a request for comment from the Wall 25 Street Journal in 2018 and shortly before this email and they 1859 1 wanted a comment on -- on any interactions regarding Stormy 2 Daniels and Donald Trump. 3 Q And so, just to clarify, you received an inquiry from 4 the Wall Street Journal that led you to believe that they were 5 getting ready to publish an article about the contact between 6 Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump?

7 A Yes. 8 Q And this was how you responded? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And tell us how you responded, please. Just read it 11 for us.

14 Q And did you write that to the Wall Street Journal 17 Q On what day?

18 A January 10th, 2018. 19 Q And what did you mean when you said "Our prior denial 20 issued in 2011"? 21 What was that a reference to?

22 A The Cease and Desist demand letter that was sent to 23 TheDirty.com in 2011. 24 Q And did you forward your response to the Wall Street 25 Journal reporter to anyone?

12 A "Nothing about the present day regurgitation of these 13 rumors causes us to rethink our prior denial issued in 2011."
15 reporter? 16 A I did.

1860 1 A To Michael Cohen. Yes, to Michael Cohen.

2 Q And why did you do that? 3 A Because we had a mutuality of interest at this period 4 of time. 5 Q Can you explain that a little bit to the jury? 6 A Well, we had a fully executed Settlement Agreement and 7 Confidentiality Agreement, and now the underlying matter that 8 was the subject of that Settlement Agreement/Confidentiality 9 Agreement was about to be published, and I think I had a 10 contractual duty to let him know that something was about to be 11 published. 13 it. 12 And we had sort of -- we were acting in unison to address 14 Q Okay. So I want to now show you what has been 15 privately -- what has been marked for identification as People's 16 Exhibit -- 17 MR. STEINGLASS: Privately, please, thank you.

20 (Displayed only to those previously-described.) 21 Q Do you recognize this exhibit? 22 A Yes. 23 Q What is it? 24 A I believe that these are -- it's a database of 25 messaging between Michael Cohen and I. 18 Q What has been marked for identification as People's 19 Exhibit 255.

1861 1 Q And are these instant messages back and forth between 2 yourself and Michael Cohen during this period in January and 3 perhaps in February of 2018? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Do you remember sending and receiving these texts? 6 A For the most part, yes. 7 Q And do they pertain to your conversations with Michael 8 Cohen at -- at or around the time that the details of the Stormy 9 Daniels payoff became public?

10 A The Stormy Daniels settlement. 11 Q The Stormy Daniels settlement, yes? 12 A Yes. 13 Q And are they exact copies of your instant messages back 14 and forth between Michael Cohen, to the best of your 15 recollection? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And do the date and timestamps appear to be accurate, 18 to the best of your recollection? 19 A Yes. 20 MR. STEINGLASS: I offer them into evidence. Or I 21 offer this exhibit into evidence. 22 MR. BOVE: No objection. 25 ********* 23 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 24 (So marked in evidence.)
1 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

2 And I am now displaying publicly People's 3 Exhibit 255, starting on Page 1. 4 And I am going to ask that we blow up -- thank 12 A January 10th, 2018. 13 Q And who is that first one from and who is it to? 14 A From me to Michael Cohen.

15 Q And what is the body of the texts or instant message? 16 A You know, when I look at this -- I think earlier I
17 testified that that email that I sent to the Wall Street 18 Journal, they called me for a comment. 19 Now that I read this, it makes me think that maybe they 20 called her for comment and I responded on her behalf, for 21 whatever that's worth.

22 Q Thank you for clarifying that. 23 A Thanks. 24 Q You can proceed, please.

25 A Okay. WSJ -- the Wall Street Journal -- called 1862 10 So starting with this top one. What is the date of these 11 blown-up texts?

9 And give us the date when appropriate.

6 Q And kind of the way we did with the Exhibit 176A, I'm 7 just going to ask you to read some of these text back and forth 8 and explain what they mean.

5 you -- lines 1 and 2.

1863 1 Stormy. She didn't answer.

2 They say they are running a story and have a deadline of 3 tonight for her comment -- tonight for her to comment. 4 Q Thank you. 5 And how did Michael Cohen respond to that? 6 A Write a strong denial for her like you did before. 7 Q And what did you understand that to mean? 8 A Like, I understood that he wanted me to write a strong 11 A Everything. 13 A Yes. 14 Q So without revealing privileged communications, did you 15 send a denial to Stormy Daniels for her to sign? 17 Q Okay. Take a look, please, at People's Exhibit 277 in 19 (Displayed.) 20 Q Do you recognize this document? 21 A I do. 22 Q What is it? 23 A This is a statement from Stormy Daniels dated 24 January 10th, 2018. 25 Q And did you prepare this statement?

16 A I don't recall.

9 denial comment for her.

10 Q A denial of what? 12 Q Including the sexual encounter with Donald Trump?

18 evidence.

1864 1 A I believe so.

2 Q Can you read it to us, please? 3 A "January 10th, 2018. To Whom it May Concern: I 4 recently became aware that certain news outlets are alleging 5 that I had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump 6 many, many, many years ago. 7 I am stating with complete clarity that this is absolutely 8 false. 9 My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public 10 appearances and nothing more. 11 When I met Donald Trump, he was gracious, professional and a 12 complete gentleman to me and everyone in my presence. 15 If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump, trust 16 me, you wouldn't be reading about it in the news, you would be 17 reading about it in my book.

18 But the fact of the matter is, these stories are not true. 19 Stormy Daniels. 20 Q How would you characterize, Mr. Davidson, the 21 truthfulness of this statement? 22 A Well, I think that this is a tactic that is oftentimes 23 used in the, oftentimes, the cat and mouse interactions between 24 publicists and attorneys and the press and that an extremely 25 strict, extremely strict reading of this denial would 13 Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are 14 completely false.

1865 1 technically be true.

2 Q Can you explain that? How is this technically true? 3 A Well, I think you have to go through it word by word, 4 and it would -- if you did so, I think it would technically be 5 true with an extremely fine reading of it. 6 Q So let me direct you to two parts in particular. 7 The first two sentences, when it states that she -- that 8 Ms. Daniels was contacted by certain news outlets alleging that 9 she had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump, many, 10 many, many years ago and then it states that that's absolutely 11 false. 12 How is that technically correct? 13 A Well, I think you would have to hone in on the 14 definition of romantic, sexual and affair. 15 Q Okay. Can you explain that? 16 A Well, I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that 17 any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic.

18 Q Okay. How about sexual? 19 A Well, that would be a sexual and/or romantic. 20 Q Okay. So let me just zoom out for a second and say, 21 did you understand this statement to be cleverly misleading? 22 A I don't understand the question. 23 Q Did you understand, at the time that you wrote this 24 letter, that Stormy Daniels had, in fact, had a sexual encounter 25 with Donald Trump at some point?

1866 1 A That was my understanding.

2 Q Okay. So I want to direct your attention to the first 3 line of the second paragraph: "Rumors that I received hush 4 money from Donald Trump are completely false," okay. 5 A Yes. 6 Q How is that technically true? 7 A Well, it's really no different than our interaction a 8 few minutes ago where you called it a payoff. 9 Q Okay.

10 A It wasn't a payoff and it wasn't hush money. It was 11 consideration in a civil Settlement Agreement. 12 Q Can you just explain that a little bit more of what 13 consideration is for, what you mean when you say a 14 consideration? 15 A Well, I think, in the simplest of examples, a 16 consideration is money or something of value that's exchanged in 17 a contract.

18 I will pay you $5 if you mow my lawn. The $5 will be a 19 consideration. 20 Q So do I understand you correctly to be saying that you 21 don't think the term "hush money" accurately describes the 22 exchange of money that -- the money that was paid to Stormy 23 Daniels by Donald Trump? 24 A Can you please restate that. 25 Q Yeah. Do I understand you -- withdrawn.

1867 1 Would you use the phrase "hush money" to describe the money 2 that was paid to your client by Donald Trump? 3 A I would never use that word. 4 Q And what would be the word that you would use to 5 describe it? 6 A Consideration. 7 Q Okay. 8 I now want to ask you if you sent a copy of this document to 9 Michael Cohen?

10 A I did. 11 Q All right. I now want to move on and show you more of 12 what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 255. 13 (Displayed.) 14 Q Is that a series of text exchanges from January 2018 15 with Michael Cohen? 16 And particularly I want to direct your attention to Page 2, 17 Entry 19.

18 (Displayed.) 19 Q And ask you what is being said and by whom and when? 20 A This is January 17th, 2018, from Michael Cohen to me. 21 "I have her tentatively scheduled for Hannity tonight. Call me 22 after your trial." 23 Q Now, can you tell us what you understood that to mean, 24 please, Mr. Davidson? 25 A I understood this to mean that he had her tentatively, 1868 1 "her," Stormy Daniels, tentatively scheduled to appear on the 2 television show Hannity that night. 3 Q Do you know for what purpose? 4 A No. 5 Q So you understood this to mean, to be saying -- for 6 Michael Cohen to be is stating that he had scheduled your client 7 to appear on Hannity that night? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And did your client actually appear on Hannity that 10 night? 11 A No. 12 Q Have you previously examined this text exchange? 13 A I have previously seen it. 14 Q Are there a series of texts about whether -- whether 15 or not she should appear and when on Hannity that followed this? 16 A I think. And preceded it. 17 But this was sort of in one of Michael Cohen's pants on fire 18 stages, where he was sort of frantically trying to address the 19 fact that Stormy's story had percolated into public consumption 20 and he -- he was frantic. 21 I was in a trial and -- which is fairly all consuming -- and 22 it was just many, many, many phone calls and many, many text 23 messages with little regard for my schedule. 24 Q Did you have any understanding of how having your 25 client appear on Hannity would help Michael Cohen? Why he was 1869 1 pushing for that?

2 A A few minutes ago, we discussed the -- Michael Cohen's 3 request for me to write a strong denial the way that I did way 4 back then. 5 And what he was referring to, I think, was the letter that I 6 sent to The Dirty in 2011. 7 But there was no denial in the -- in the Cease and Desist 8 demand that I sent to The Dirty in 2011. And that as a fact was 9 just wrong.

10 And then I sent him the exhibit that we just looked at, 11 which was sort of that carefully worded denial. 12 And I believe that he thought that her -- he, Michael Cohen, 13 thought that Stormy going on Hannity, which -- would somehow 14 help him and his client. 15 I believe that I -- I had an understanding that he believed 16 that she would further deny the interaction. 17 Q Okay. Moving on to another text that I want to bring 18 to your attention. 22 A It was January 17th, 2018, from Michael Cohen to me. 23 Q And what does it say? 19 And this is the one beginning "Keith, the wise men," okay. 20 What was the date that this text was sent and who was it sent 21 from and who was it sent to? 24 A "Keith, the wise men all believe the story is dying and 25 don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews." Period.

1870 1 "Let her do her thing, but no interviews at all with anyone."
2 Q And did you respond? 3 MR. STEINGLASS: I think we need to blow up one 4 more text here.

6 A "100 percent."
7 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we have them together, 19 Q And, to your knowledge, did she appear on Hannity?

20 A She never appeared on Hannity, to my knowledge. 21 Q Okay. And just turning your attention to the next 22 page, continuing this same exchange, how does -- after you say 23 "100 percent," how does Michael Cohen respond? 24 A "Thanks, pal."
25 Q And does he send a follow-up text after that?

5 (Displayed.)
8 please.

## 9 (Displayed.)

10 Q Okay. Mr. Davidson, what did you understand Michael 11 Cohen's text to mean when he said "The wise men all believe the 12 story is dying and she shouldn't do any interviews"? 13 A Again, that this was sort of in one of his pants on 14 fire stages and that he was running around planning things.

15 And then when he ran it up the flag pole or consulted 16 someone or some group, whoever "wise men" are, that they didn't 17 think that it was a good idea for her to actually appear on 18 Hannity.

1871 1 A Yes.

2 Q And what does he say? 3 A "Just no interviews or statements unless through you." 4 Q And what did you understand that to mean? 5 A That it was his request that I manage the 6 communications for her. 7 Q "Her" being Stormy Daniels? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Okay. And how did you respond?

10 A "Got it." 11 Q Showing you some more of this exchange on Page 7, 12 Lines 64 through 73. 13 And, again, I will just ask you to kind of walk us through 14 who sends which texts when and what they mean. 15 Starting -- 16 MR. STEINGLASS: And maybe we can zoom in a little 17 bit.

18 (Displayed.) 19 Q Starting with, "And she's 64." 20 A So you would just like me to read it? 21 Q Well, I would like you to tell us the date, who is it 22 from, who is it to. 23 And then, yes, please read? 24 A Okay. January 24th, 2018, from me to Michael Cohen. 25 "Spoke to her." Meaning Stormy. "Everything is as we 1872 1 discussed. She steadfastly refuses to speak about the past."
2 Q And what did Michael Cohen say? 3 A 1/25/2018: "We will see because it airs tonight." 4 Q And did he then send another text that same day? 5 A I think it might be the next day, the 26th. 6 Q Oh. It's a little small for me to read from here. 7 Thank you. The 26th. Yes, please? 8 A From Michael Cohen to me, "Why is she going on Kimmel 9 after the SOTU."
10 Q Do you have an understanding of what "S-O-T-U" meant? 11 A Yes. 12 Q What? 13 A State of the Union Address. 14 Q And does that particular text from Michael Cohen stand 15 out to you for any reason? 16 A No. 17 Q Okay. How did you respond, if at all?

18 A I responded very shortly thereafter, "IDK" -- I don't 19 know -- "I was pissed. She said this is her shot. I'm not 20 meeting with her this weekend to prep her." 21 "Prep her and" -- I would like to start over. 22 Q Sure. 23 A "IDK." I don't know. "I was pissed. She said this is 24 her shot. I'm meeting with her this weekend to prep her and get 25 the statement."
1873 1 Q What statement were you trying to get?

2 A He had asked -- at this moment in time, I was in a very 3 difficult situation and I think Stormy was in a very difficult 4 situation. 5 She had that lengthy Settlement Agreement, which called for 6 penalties if she breached the non-disparagement, she would have 7 to give back any profits that she made. 8 She would have to return the consideration, the 130,000, and 9 she may have to pay, if it was enforceable, the liquidated 10 damage clause. 11 And so we have Cohen saying -- and what I understood him 12 saying -- let her do her thing, just don't talk about the past. 13 And Stormy saying, I, you know, this was her shot. She 14 wanted to -- she wanted to talk about her life and reinvigorate 15 her career. 16 So this was a conversation about Stormy Daniels going on the 17 Late Night Show with Jimmy Kimmel.

18 Q Okay. So continue onto the next page, Page 8, entries 19 74 to 75. 20 Again, I will just ask you to give us, the same way you have 21 been doing, the date, and who is texting who and what is being 22 said? 23 A This is a text from Michael to me on January 30th, 24 2018, "It is out." 25 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we just blow this up a 1874 1 little bit more or zoom in a little bit more.

2 (Displayed.) 3 Q And what are these series of -- you don't have to read 4 every single one of these, what are these texts about and did 5 you already tell us the date of these? 6 A January 30th. 7 Q So what are you texting about at this point? 8 A Apparently, there was a news article that had been 9 published. I was receiving hundreds of phone calls at my 10 office. 11 Q Okay. 12 MR. STEINGLASS: Let's scroll down a little bit. 13 (Displayed.) 14 Q Do you see the texts that is -- it looks like it's on 15 January 30th, 2018, at 5:49:59 p.m.? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And who is that from?

18 A From me to Michael Cohen. 19 Q And what is the body of the text? 20 A "She is stating that she authorized it and she released 21 it of her own volition." 22 Q And what did you understand that to mean or what did 23 you mean when you wrote that, I should say? 24 A That's the -- Michael Cohen had requested yet another 25 statement from Stormy Daniels and that on the day of -- that she 1875 1 was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel -- and he wanted to know whether 2 or not she was going to release it. 3 Q Okay. I want to show you Page 9, just to continue 4 this, of the same exhibit, lines 86 through 87. 7 A This is January 30th, 2018, from me to Michael Cohen. 8 Quote: "She's good for now... but it's a shit load of work." 9 Q But what did you mean by that? What was a lot of 10 work? 11 A Just this case had begun to eat up a lot of time. 12 Q And how did Michael Cohen respond? 13 A "I'm sorry but thank you." 14 Q And so you just referenced another statement. Did you, 15 in fact, prepare another denial for her to sign immediately 16 prior to her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel? 17 A There was another statement that was prepared and 18 released. 19 Q Okay. Let me show you People's Exhibit 278. This is 20 in evidence. 21 MR. STEINGLASS: I will ask that we blow it up a 22 little bit. 23 Q And I will ask you, is this the statement of denial 24 from January 30th, 2018? 25 A Yes.

5 And, again, I would just ask you to tell us who is texting 6 who when and what it means?

1876 1 Q And did -- withdrawn.

2 Who typed this document? 3 A I did. 4 Q And where were you when you did that? 5 A I was in the Marilyn Monroe Suite at the Roosevelt 6 Hotel in Hollywood, California. 7 Q And who else was present? 8 A There were make-up artists. To my recollection, there 9 were make-up artists and hair dressers.

10 There was the -- Gina Rodriguez was there; her then 12 Stormy was there. 13 I was there. 14 I think that's it. 15 Q And where in relation did -- withdrawn. 16 Did you say why you were in that room in the hotel? What 17 was happening?

18 Why was hair and make up there? 19 A The -- the Roosevelt Hotel is a classic, old Hollywood 20 place on Hollywood Boulevard where they have the Hollywood Walk 22 And it's right next to where Kimmel films. 23 And the Jimmy Kimmel Show had put Stormy up at the Roosevelt 24 Hotel and specifically requested that suite. 25 And I think she was preparing to go on Kimmel that night.

11 boyfriend Anthony was there.

1877 1 Q Okay. Can you read for us the statement.

2 A "To Whom it May Concern:" 3 Next paragraph. 4 "Over the past few weeks, I have been asked countless times 5 to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship that I 6 had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago." 7 Next paragraph. 8 "The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged 9 affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017 and now 10 again in 2018." 11 "I am not denying this affair because I was paid 'hush 12 money' as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids. I am 13 denying this affair because it never happened." Period. 14 Next paragraph. 15 "I will have no further comment on this matter." Period. 16 "Please feel free to check me out on Instagram at 17 @TheStormyDaniels."
18 Excuse me, "@TheStormyDaniels." 19 Q Mr. Davidson, how would you characterize truthfulness 20 of this statement? 21 A I think it's technically true. 22 Q Can you explain that? 23 Can you explain how it's true that it says an alleged sexual 24 relationship, which basically denies them having a sexual 25 relationship; is that right?

1878 1 A Yes.

2 Q And how is that -- how is that technically true? 3 A Because I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that 4 there was a relationship between Stormy Daniels and Donald 5 Trump. 6 I believe their relationship is an ongoing interaction. 7 Q And it also makes a reference -- withdrawn. 8 It denies that Stormy Daniels was paid hush money. 9 If I asked you to explain that, would you give basically the 10 same answer that you gave in connection with the denial from 11 January 10th of 2018? 12 A I would. 13 Q Okay. I want to go back to your exchange with Michael 14 Cohen on People's Exhibit 255.

18 Q Starting with the top. Can you give us the time, 19 please, and the date. 20 A The date is -- they are all January 31st, 2018. It 21 starts at 12:21 a.m., from Michael Cohen to me. 22 Q And is that 12:21 a.m. UTC minus 5? 23 A I don't know. 24 Q Does it say UTC minus 5? 25 A It does.

15 Directing your attention, in particular, to Page 9, starting 16 with Entries 88 to 97. 17 (Displayed.)
1879 1 Q Okay. But you don't know what that means; is that 2 right? 3 A Well, I could figure it out, but. 4 Q Well, I don't want you to guess -- 5 A All right. 6 Q -- if you're not sure? 7 A I don't know. 8 Q Okay. So what did the -- who is the first text from in 9 this particular exchange?

10 A "She just denied the letter." This is from Michael 11 Cohen to me. 12 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg 13 relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official 14 court reporter.) 15 ********** 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1880 1 Q Okay.

2 And what did you understand it to mean? 3 A Well, I took it to mean that he was watching Stormy 4 Daniels on Kimmel, and that he was reporting to me what was 5 being broadcast.

8 Q What is the next text in this chain, from whom to 10 A From Michael Cohen to me: "Claiming it's not her 12 Q Keep going, please. 13 A "You said she did it in front of you." 14 Q I should just ask, this series of texts that's up on 15 the screen, are these sent within fairly rapid succession, all 16 within a five-minute window?

17 A Yes.

19 to be happening while Michael Cohen was watching Stormy Daniels 20 appearing on the Kimmel show; correct? 21 A Yes.

22 Q So, what do you understand it to mean when Michael 23 Cohen said to you, "You said she did it in front of you"? 24 A Um, that he was repeating something I had previously 25 told him, which is that that most recent statement was signed 9 whom?

6 Q So, who do you understand "she" to be in reference to?

7 A Stormy Daniels.

18 Q And I believe you testified that you understood this 11 signature."
1881 1 in front of me.

2 Q The one that was signed in the Roosevelt Hotel? 3 A That's right. 4 Q So, then did you respond to Michael Cohen?

5 A Yes. 6 Q And what did you say?

7 A "She did." Period. "Impossible. She posted it on her 9 Q How did Michael Cohen respond?

10 A "They showed her signature and she claimed it was not 11 hers on Kimmel."
12 Q Did you respond in any way? 13 A "WTF." 14 Q I hate to ask, what does that mean?

15 A It's sort of an -- it's a signal of exasperation of: 16 What the fuck.

18 information, but I wasn't watching the show. 19 Q Got it.

20 Scrolling down to Page 11, Lines 112 to 113. 21 I should ask before I blow this up, in the interim, is 22 there some back and forth about Stormy Daniels' appearance on 23 Kimmel? 24 A Yes.

25 Q So, now, going to Lines 112 and 113 on Page 11, I'm 8 own Twitter page."
17 I didn't watch Kimmel, so I was getting all this 1882 1 going to ask you what time this text was sent and by whom?

2 A January 31, 2018, at 1:30 UTC, from Michael to me: 3 "Please tell Gina to ensure she responds the same as your 4 statement tomorrow when she does The View." That television 5 show. "This is not a comedy show!" Exclamation point. 6 Q What did you understand that to mean?

9 Q Before we move on, I believe you testified this was 10 UTC. 11 But, does it actually say UTC minus five?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Shortly thereafter, did you respond to Michael Cohen? 14 A Yes.

15 Q What did you say? 16 A "Gina is ticked off at Stormy because Stormy made her 17 look like a liar. Gina says she is going to have a long talk 23 A Well, again, like I mentioned earlier, we're trying to 24 thread a needle and hold off allegations of breach and all the 25 penalties that would come with that, where -- where Cohen 7 A That Michael was upset about what he understood was 8 Stormy denying that she had signed the statement.

18 with Stormy on the plane to New York tomorrow. She assured me 19 that this will get handled."
20 Apparently, they were going to New York to film The View. 21 Q What were you saying to Michael Cohen here? What did 22 you mean?

1883 4 Q And without getting into any privileged communications 17 do?

18 A I don't understand your question.

22 regarding Stormy Daniels and her story? 23 A Well, he wants to hear her deny her story to protect 24 his client.

25 Q That's what I was asking.

7 A Many times. 8 Q Can you tell us, basically, what he said about that? 9 A He would -- I mean, he can be a very aggressive guy.

10 Aggressive in his pursuits to protect his client. 11 And he would, often times, you know, make legal threats, 12 say that he would bankrupt her and, um, "Rain legal hell down 13 upon her," um, and, "Don't fuck with us. You don't know who 14 you're fucking with," things like that.

15 Q And what did you -- if you had an understanding, what 16 did you understand Michael Cohen to be attempting to get you to 1 would -- would -- you know, file an arbitration or sue Stormy, 2 and that would be a whole 'nother disaster. So, we're trying 3 to placate him while also trying to meet Stormy's desires.

5 between yourself and Stormy Daniels, did Michael Cohen threaten 6 a lawsuit against Stormy Daniels?

20 Regarding Stormy Daniels' story, did you have an 21 understanding about what Michael Cohen wanted you to do 19 Q Okay.

1884 1 Okay.

2 Going back to this -- excuse me one second. 3 Going back to People's 255, your text exchange with Michael 4 Cohen, and turning to Page 12, Lines 122 to 123. I'm sorry.

5 122 to 133.

12 A No. 13 Q You want me to keep going? 14 MR. STEINGLASS: Let's scroll down a little bit 15 more. 16 (Whereupon, the exhibit scrolls on the screens.)
17 Q Let me stop right there for a second and direct you to 18 the text that appears to be on February 13, 2018, at 10:30 PM, 19 UTC minus five time.

20 Okay? 21 A Okay.

22 Q It says Michael Cohen appeared to text you a 23 particular email address. 24 A Yes.

25 Q Whose email address does he text you?

6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MR. STEINGLASS: I'll just ask you to blow it up a 8 little bit. 9 Q You don't have to read every single one of these, but 10 could you read them to yourself and tell us a little bit about 11 what's happening here?

1885 1 A Christopher Cuomo.

2 Q Who did you understand Christopher Cuomo to be? 3 A He's a news broadcaster, then with CNN. 4 Q Okay.

5 Scrolling down a little bit.

9 Q What is he saying?

10 A The first one is: "Yes." 11 The second one is: "Can you send me the statement."
12 Q And did you respond to that within a little less than 13 an hour or so?

15 Q And what did you say? 16 A "I am sending you this draft because it is truthful.

17 What do you think? I represented Stephanie Clifford in the 18 Michael Cohen, slash, Stephanie Clifford transaction. I read 19 today that Michael Cohen reports that the source of the 20 $130,000 paid to Ms. Clifford was from his own personal funds. 21 Period. That assertion is in complete harmony with what he 22 informed me of at the time of the transaction." 23 Q And did Michael Cohen respond? 24 A Yes.

25 Q What did he say?

8 A Yes. Yes.

6 Did you see the text that's sent about 11:55 PM from 7 Michael Cohen?

14 A Yes.

1886 1 A "Perfect. Send to Cuomo."
2 Q What's going on here, Mr. Davidson? 3 A Uh, I don't know. I think that he was under some fire, 4 um, and wanted validation or corroboration that the 130,000 5 was, in fact, paid from him and not paid from anyone else. 6 Q And did he ask you to write a statement to that effect 7 to send to Christopher Cuomo? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And did you share it with Michael Cohen before sending 10 it to Christopher Cuomo? 11 A I did.

12 Q And did you, ultimately, send it to Christopher Cuomo? 13 A I did. I recall that I did. I believe I did. 14 Q How would you characterize the truthfulness of this 15 statement? 16 A I believe it's truthful.

17 Q Did you -- you told us yesterday that you believe that 18 the ultimate source of the funds was Donald Trump; is that 19 correct?

20 A Yes. 21 Q So, how do you reconcile those two -- how do you 22 reconcile that with the statement? 23 A The going back and forth in the days before that this 24 Stormy Daniels/Michael Cohen deal was consummated in 25 October 2016; and if you recall, there was a period where he 1887 1 said, Fuck it. I'll just do it myself." That's what I was 2 referring to in the statement.

6 Q Can you just clarify that for a second?

7 A At the time of the transaction, Michael Cohen told 8 me -- as the statement said, at the time of the transaction, 9 Michael Cohen told me, "Fuck it. I'll just do it myself."
10 Q Okay. So -- all right. I understand. 11 Thank you.

12 Um, my next question is, did you -- directing your 13 attention, I guess, to early April of 2018, did you go on CNN 14 and say that Michael Cohen used his own funds to pay Stormy 15 Daniels? 16 A I believe so.

17 Q And why did you say that?

18 A Because I understood that he did. 19 Q Based on the same statement that he made at the time 20 of the transaction?

23 had not been reimbursed. 24 Q Okay.

25 MR. STEINGLASS: Um, one more moment, please.

3 Q So, the statement does not undermine your belief that 4 the ultimate source of the funds was Mike -- was Donald Trump?

5 A At the time of the transaction.

21 A And even later on, that December 9th conversation that 22 I had with him at the department store where he said that he 1888 1 (Whereupon, the People confer.)
3 this trial? 2 Q Mr. Davidson, do you have any stake in the outcome of 4 A No. Not at all.

5 MR. STEINGLASS: No further questions. 6 THE COURT: Thank you.

7 Let's go ahead and take our morning recess, 8 jurors. 9 Step out, and I'll see you in about ten minutes 10 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 11 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 12 are excused.) 13 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.) 14 (Whereupon, a recess is taken.)
15 ******************************************** 16 THE COURT: We can get the witness.

17 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

18 (Whereupon, the witness, Keith Davidson, having 19 been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the 20 witness stand and testifies as follows:) 21 COURT OFFICER: All rise.

22 Jury entering. 23 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 24 are present and properly seated.)
25 THE CLERK: Case on trial continued.

1 All jurors are present and properly seated.

2 THE COURT: Counsel, will you stipulate that the 3 jurors are present. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: I'm sorry. 8 CROSS-EXAMINATION 9 BY MR. BOVE:
10 11 Q Good morning, Mr. Davidson.

12 A Good morning. 13 Q Barely good morning. 14 My name is Emil Bove, and I represent President Trump, 15 who's here on my left. 16 A Nice to meet you.

17 Q It's nice to meet you, too.

18 You've never met President Trump; correct?

20 Q And Tuesday was the first time that you've been in the 21 same room as him; right?

22 A That's true. 23 Q You've never spoken to President Trump? 24 A Never.

25 Q You have no first-hand knowledge of the business Laurie Eisenberg, CSR, RPR
1889 19 A Never.

7 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.

6 THE COURT: Mr. Bove. 5 Yes, Judge.

1890 1 records of The Trump Organization; right?

2 A Only those that I received. 4 correct?

5 A Emails and such. 6 Q In fact, everything that you know about President 7 Trump came from either TV or Michael Cohen; right? 8 A No. 9 Q Much of what you testified to today with respect to 10 your beliefs about Mr. Trump came from Mr. Cohen; right? 11 A I have -- I have had no personal interactions with 12 Donald Trump. And either it came from my clients, Michael 13 Cohen, and from some other source, but certainly not from him. 14 Q I would like to focus on 2016.

15 A All right. 16 Q In that period, you had a strong professional 17 relationship with Dylan Howard; right?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And a close personal relationship, also; right?

20 Friends? 21 A Fair.

22 Q I think you said you'd known him for over a decade; 23 right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q How did you guys meet?

3 Q Well, you received some records from Michael Cohen; 1891 1 A I'm not sure.

2 Q Was it in connection with your work? 3 A I believe so. 4 Q And in 2016, you were talking to Mr. Howard just about 6 A I would think. Several times a week.

7 Q And on the professional side of things, Mr. Howard 8 helped you get business from AMI; right?

10 Q You got a couple of matters from AMI; right? 11 A Limited, yes.

12 Q One was an employment claim by a reporter; right?

18 A That's right. 19 Q Would it surprise you to learn that Mr. Howard 20 considered you to be a major source of information? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And that surprises you, notwithstanding the near-daily 23 contact in 2016? 24 A Correct.

25 Q And is part of the reason for your surprise is that 13 A I think so. 14 I seem to recall there was a California matter. They were 15 being sued, and I was being consulted on that. 16 Q And there was an entertainment deal with film rights 17 AMI decided not to move forward on?

5 every day; right?

9 A Yes.

1892 1 you're an attorney; right?

2 A Yes.

3 Q And you're not suggesting that you were providing 4 client confidences to Dylan Howard; right? 5 A Not at all. 6 Q And then, one of the things you talked about on 7 Tuesday and today, I think, was your representation of Karen 8 McDougal; correct? 9 A Yes.

10 Q If I understood it correctly, Ms. McDougal did not 11 want to publish an article about the claims that have been 12 discussed here; right?

13 A True. 14 Q And you testified in the Grand Jury in this case; 15 right? 16 A I did.

17 Q At the District Attorney's Office; correct?

18 A Yes. 19 Q They were the ones asking the questions; right? 20 A Fair. 21 Q And that was in 2023?

22 A I -- I can't recall.

23 Q It was within the last 18 months? 24 A Roughly. 25 Q In there, you testified that Miss McDougal never 1893 1 really wanted to tell her story to the public; right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And I think you said on Tuesday that she had three 4 goals; right?

5 A Yes. 6 Q One goal was to rejuvenate her career; right?

7 A True. 8 Q And that was your understanding in 2016; correct? 9 A That's true.

10 Q And Ms. McDougal had had a real career up to that 11 point; is that right?

12 A She certainly had had a real career prior to, yes. 13 Q She had been on magazine covers; correct? 14 A More than that. Yeah. She had -- she had a very 16 Q And that included not just on the Playboy part, but 18 A I believe so. 19 Q And so, by "rejuvenate", there was -- at the time, in 20 2016, when you say "rejuvenate", there was ongoing value in her 21 image and likeness; right?

22 A Yes. 23 Q And I think you said that one of the other goals was 24 to make money; right?

25 A Yes.

17 also in the fitness industry; right?

15 healthy career.

1894 1 Q And I want to talk about this, more about this a 2 little later.

5 A That's fair. 6 Q And the third goal was the one we were talking about, 7 to avoid having to tell her story; correct? 8 A True. 9 Q And Ms. McDougal has been clear about that publicly; 10 right? 11 A That's my understanding.

15 Q And you have described the deal that she got with AMI 16 as her "dream deal"; right?

17 A I think she described it as her "dream deal".

18 Q And that's consistent with your interactions with her; 19 correct?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And you don't think -- tell me if this is wrong.

22 You did not discuss the McDougal AMI deal with Michael Cohen 23 until after it was closed; right? 24 A Yes. That is true.

25 Q And I think -- sorry to cut you off.

12 Q She said that on -- in an interview with Anderson 13 Cooper? 14 A Yes.

3 That wasn't just her goal, but it was also the goal of some 4 of the people around her?

1 I think you said on Tuesday that you reached out to him 2 afterwards as a professional courtesy? 3 A Yes. 4 Q But he wasn't involved in any negotiations; correct?

5 A Not that I'm aware of. 6 Q Let's focus on Cohen a little bit.

8 2011?

10 Q And that was in connection with this kind of blog post 11 on The Dirty?

12 A True. 13 Q The Dirty was a web post at the time that focused on 14 gossip?

15 A Fair. 16 Q And there was a post with the general substance of the 17 same allegations that Stormy Daniels made subsequently, in 18 2016; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And at that time, 2011, Gina Rodriguez was Stormy 21 Daniels' manager?

22 A Yes. 23 Q She told you that she wanted to get the story taken 24 down?

25 A That's true.

1895 7 I think you said you encountered him for the first time in 9 A True.

1896 1 Q And you described Ms. Rodriguez as sort of a story 2 broker? 3 A That's part of what she does, yes. 4 Q And part of her business, I think you said, was in 5 monetizing stories? 6 A That's true.

7 Q Monetizing news? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And in 2011, you had already been working with 10 Ms. Rodriguez for a while; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And, so, you served as a conduit to help get this 13 story down?

16 Q And you said, "in essence, retained".

17 You were, in fact, retained by Stormy Daniels in connection 18 with that engagement; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And that engagement, the attorney-client engagement 21 was not committed to writing; was it?

22 A It was not. 23 Q And there's nothing wrong with that; is there? 24 A There is not.

25 Q That's an ethical practice, to have an attorney-client 14 A I was asked. I was, in essence, retained to use my 15 best efforts to get that blog taken down, yes.

1897 1 relationship without an Engagement Letter; right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Now, focusing on Ms. Rodriguez for a minute. 4 Is it fair to say that you've had a reciprocal referral 5 relationship with Gina Rodriguez? 6 A I think that's fair.

17 Q I mean, you actually tried to represent her in 18 connection with this investigation; right?

20 She was contacted by the District Attorney's Office. They 21 wanted her to come in and give a statement. And I returned the 22 call on her behalf as my client. 23 Q The reason I used the word "try" is that you were 24 instructed by the District Attorney's Office that they viewed 25 that as a conflict because of your status as a witness; right?

7 Q She sends you some business? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Some clients?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And vice-versa; you send her some clients; right?

12 A I think less so, but perhaps. 13 Q Reciprocal, but a little bit one-sided? 14 A I don't know.

15 Q You're still fairly close with Ms. Rodriguez; right? 16 A Somewhat.

19 A Well, I didn't try to.

1898 1 A Well, I took issue with that, but yes.

2 Q You didn't necessarily agree, but that was the 3 instruction? 4 A I don't agree with the word "instruction".

5 That was their -- 6 Q Position?

7 A -- position. That was their position. 8 Q My point here was, the relationship with Rodriguez and 9 you was close enough in 2023 that she still looked at you as 10 someone that she still trusted to be her counsel? 11 A True.

14 A Yes. 17 A Correct.

18 Q The story started to get out there a little bit; 19 right?

20 A That's right. Yes. It was republished or repurposed by 21 other elements.

22 Q So, the news had been disseminated; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And you also worked to have the Daily News take down 25 their internet article reflecting Ms. Daniels' allegations; 12 Q And in 2011, the way that this worked, as I understand 13 it, is that you sent a Cease and Desist Letter to The Dirty?

15 Q And at some point around this time, the blog post got 16 picked up by the New York Daily News; correct?

1899 1 correct?

2 A I believe so. 3 Q And in connection with that effort, you working to get 4 the story from the Daily News down, you were also acting as 7 Q Still no Retainer Agreement; right? 8 A Correct. 9 Q Did you ever have an Engagement Letter with 10 Ms. Daniels? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Was that in 2016? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Now let's focus a little bit on that 2016 engagement.

15 You had an Engagement Letter for providing legal services 16 to Ms. Daniels; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And I think you described reaching a settlement; 19 correct?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And you've used during your testimony litigation terms 22 like "plaintiff" and "defendant" to describe the parties to 23 that Settlement Agreement; right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q So, from your perspective, it is true, is it not, that 5 Ms. Daniels' attorney; right? 6 A Yes.

1900 1 you're providing Ms. Daniels legal services with regard to the 2 Agreement that led to the payment of $130,000? 3 A Yes. 4 Q You talked a little bit today about the Side Letter to 5 the Agreement in 2016. 6 A Yes.

7 Q Remember that? 9 Q I think the word "decoded" was used; right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q These acronyms, Peggy Peterson and David Dennison; 12 right? 14 Q That was something you had used in the past; right?

15 A Yes. 16 Q That was your idea; right?

18 It's widely used with these types of agreements. 19 Q You talked a little bit, today, about a December 9th, 20 2016 conversation with Michael Cohen; right? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And I think you said he sounded disheartened; correct? 23 A I -- yes.

24 Q And at other times, do you recall having described 25 that conversation in terms of you left the talk in concern for
17 A No. No. It's not my idea. 13 A Yes.

8 A (Nods).

1901 1 his physical safety, his wellbeing, that's how bad he sounded?

2 A I thought he was gonna kill himself. 3 Q And the concern on that call was that he understood 4 he wasn't going to get a position in President Trump's 5 Administration; right? 6 A Yes.

9 right?

10 A Amongst others. 11 Q Amongst others. Right.

14 A That's true.

15 Q In this call at the Wonderland Warehouse, he was 16 conveying to you that's not going to happen; and he was, very 17 very upset about it; correct?

18 A That's true. 19 Q Now, I would like to take a step back and talk about, 20 sort of, how you've interacted with law enforcement during the 21 course of this investigation.

22 Okay? 23 A Fair. 24 Q It started out in 2018, with some meetings with 25 Federal Prosecutors; right?

7 Q And he had at times, in conversation with you, 8 referenced potentially being President Trump's Chief of Staff; 12 He also mentioned potentially being the Attorney General of 13 the United States; right?

1 A Yes.

2 Q Do you recall how many meetings? 3 A I do. 4 Q How many?

5 A Three. 6 Q And that was in 2018; right?

11 Q And with Karen McDougal; correct?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And in those meetings, the attorney-client privilege 14 did not come up as much; right?

15 A I don't -- I don't know how to answer that question.

18 A A few times, yes. 19 Q And you've also invoked it with meetings with the 21 A Yes.

22 Q And my question is, do you recall invoking the 23 privilege during those three meetings with the Federal 24 Prosecutors in 2018?

25 A Yes.

8 Q And you were asked during those meetings about your 9 interactions with Stormy Daniels; right?

10 A Yes.

16 Q You've invoked the privilege in your testimony at this 17 trial several times; correct?

20 District Attorney that we'll talk about in a little bit; right?

1902 7 A Yes.

1903 1 Q And then, at some point, you started to meet with the 2 District Attorney's Office; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And that was several years later, correct; time went 5 by? 6 A True.

7 Q Do you remember when the first meeting was? 8 A Not particularly. 9 Q Does 2021 sound about right?

10 A I don't recall. 11 Q And do you recall if the first meeting was actually 12 remote, I think by Zoom? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And the main person asking the questions during that 15 meeting was Mark Pomerantz; do you recall that? 16 A I do.

17 Q Do you recall, at some point in the meeting, 18 Mr. Pomerantz said to you: "You've -- You're obviously 19 concerned about making statements" --
21 THE COURT: Sustained.

22 MR. BOVE: May we approach? 23 THE COURT: Sure. 24 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 25 at sidebar:)
20 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

1904 1 THE COURT: Let me hear the objection.

2 MR. STEINGLASS: Well, since I don't know what 3 he's going to ask, it's a little hard for me to object. 4 But, I don't think he could possibly be getting 22 There was then a conversation that I would 5 into what Mark Pomerantz said to him, especially because 6 it sounded like he was getting into Mark Pomerantz's 7 impression of something the witness was saying, which is 8 something -- prosecutor's perceptions of witnesses' 9 perceptions -- is something you precluded in other 10 contexts. 11 So, I didn't want the question to be asked on the 12 record. 13 THE COURT: What were you going to ask? 14 MR. BOVE: I was going to ask -- I'm summarizing 15 whether he recalled Mr. Pomerantz saying he was choosing 16 his words carefully because there was extortion inferred.

17 The reason I'm asking that question is because of 18 the effect on the witness' state of mind in connection 19 with his subsequent interactions with the Government, 20 because the way that that meeting ended was he was 21 instructed to get an attorney.

23 like to probe, where he -- and I don't have to use 24 Mr. Pomerantz's name if that's offensive. I am happy to 25 take that out.

1905 1 But, lawyers -- a member of the District 2 Attorney's Office said: We're not looking at him for 3 extortion. 4 THE COURT: We're not looking at who?

6 So, there's a benefit.

8 attaches to the Grand Jury proceedings. 9 MR. STEINGLASS: So, let me see if I understand 10 this correctly.

19 in open court:)
20 THE COURT: Objection sustained. 21 MR. BOVE: May I continue?

22 THE COURT: Yes. 23 CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION 24 BY MR. BOVE:
25 Q You said something this morning along the lines of 7 It's not, sort of, the automatic benefit that 11 What Mr. Bove is trying to elicit, one prosecutor 12 expressed a view that seemed to suggest that that 13 prosecutor believed that Mr. Davidson's conduct approached 14 extortion, but then a subsequent person said, We're not 15 looking at you for extortion, so the internal -- 16 MR. BOVE: The same prosecutor.

17 THE COURT: Objection sustained.

18 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 5 MR. BOVE: Mr. Davidson.

1906 1 Michael Cohen could be an "aggressive" guy; right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q I think that was your word, "aggressive"? 4 A That's my opinion now. I think that was my word.

5 Q And you can be aggressive, too; can't you? 6 A I don't know.

8 A I suppose.

16 A Sure.

17 Q And that can be a State or Federal crime; right?

18 A True. 19 Q And as you sit here today, it's your belief, is it 20 not, that the statute of limitations on any extortion crimes 21 has run?

22 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 23 THE COURT: Sustained as to form. 24 Please be more specific.

25 Q As you sit here today, is it your belief that any 7 Q You don't know? 9 Q What does the word "extortion" mean to you?

10 A Extortion is the -- it's the obtaining of property by 11 threat of fear or force.

12 Q Compelling an action by force or coercion. 13 How's that? 14 A (Shrugs).

15 Q Is that accurate?

1907 1 exposure that you have to State or Federal extortion crimes is 2 excluded by the statute of limitations?

6 A I have not.

7 Q When you were negotiating on behalf of Ms. McDougal 11 A I suppose.

12 Q I mean, that's something any attorney would naturally 13 want to be doing in a negotiation like this; right? 14 You were making a demand.

15 A Well, I don't know what any attorney making a demand. 16 That's, I suppose, fair.

17 Q But, in your mind, you were concerned about avoiding 18 creating evidence of extortion; correct? 19 A Not particularly.

20 Q Well, one of the issues that you had to be sensitive 21 about was not to threaten that the payment needed to be made 22 prior to the election; correct? 23 A I don't recall that. 24 Q You were concerned about linking those two issues --
25 payment, election -- were concerned in written communications; 8 and on behalf of Stormy Daniels, one of your concerns was on 9 staying on the right side of the line with respect to 10 extortion; correct?

4 Q You're an attorney, and you have not thought about 5 that prior to your testimony?

3 A I have no opinion.

1908 1 right?

2 A That was not my concern. 3 Q Do you recall being asked about this issue in meetings 4 in 2023 by the District Attorney's Office?

5 A I do not. 6 Q Do you recall a meeting where you indicated that you 9 A You're asking me --
10 Q Do you remember saying that? 11 A I remember saying I do not recall.

12 Q And it's your testimony that you -- even today, you 13 don't remember whether or not you were concerned about linking 14 the election in these payments?

19 Q And you also testified that you agreed with 20 Mr. Steinglass, that those cases frequently involved 21 Non-Disclosure Agreements; do you remember that?

22 A Fair. 23 Q And in terms of media practices and the types of work 24 that you were doing in 2015 through 2017, there's nothing out 25 of the ordinary about a NDA agreement; correct?

15 A Correct. 16 Q You said on Tuesday that in the timeframe 2015 to 17 2017, your focus was on, I think you said, media cases; right?

18 A Somewhat.

7 could not recall whether the thought of election as a deadline 8 for getting stuff done had come up?

1909 1 A That's fair.

2 Q They're used all the time; right? 3 A Fair. 4 Q In many different contexts; right?

5 A Agreed. 6 Q They are enforceable; right?

7 A True. 8 Q They're litigated sometimes; correct? 9 A Agreed.

10 Q They are upheld often; right? 11 A Agreed.

12 Q And so, there's nothing strange to you about the fact 13 that your practice involved NDA's in 2015 through 2017; right? 14 A Correct.

15 Q As far as you know, that's during the time of the 16 media lawsuits during that period?

17 A As far as I know.

18 Q In 2016, you were pretty well-versed in getting right 19 up to the line without committing extortion; right?

20 A I don't understand your question. 21 Q My question is, that you had had several 22 representations that involved situations where you were making 23 demands on third-parties on behalf of your clients; right? 24 A True.

25 Q And you were asking for money and other benefits in 1910 1 those representations; correct?

2 A True. 3 Q And you knew you had to be careful so as to not 4 violate the law prohibiting extortion; right?

5 A True.

8 right? 9 A No.

10 Q Isn't it a fact that in connection with events in 11 2012, you were investigated by State and Federal authorities 12 for committing extortion against Terry Bollea, Hulk Hogan? 13 A That's true. 14 Q And in connection with that investigation, did you or 15 did you not familiarize yourself with the extortion offenses 16 that were applicable in Florida and under Federal Law at the 17 time?

18 A That's fair. 19 Q And so, getting back to my question, by 2016, you had, 20 in fact, familiarized yourself with where that line was; right? 21 A I had familiarized myself with the law. I'm a lawyer.

22 Q And you did everything that you could to get as close 23 to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing 24 it; right?

25 A I did everything I could to make sure that my 6 Q And in 2016, you had, in fact, familiarized yourself 7 with the law of extortion based on very specific experience; 1911 1 activities were lawful.

2 Q And that included not making overt threats connected 3 to the 2016 election; didn't it? 4 A Threats to who?

5 Q To Michael Cohen. 6 A No.

7 Q No?

11 Q You never linked these negotations to the 2016 12 election with anyone; is that your testimony? 13 A That's fair. 14 Q In 2010, you represented a woman named Dawn Holland; 15 right?

17 Q And Dawn Holland leaked information about the 18 treatment of Lindsay Lohan at a rehab facility; correct? 19 A It was reported that that's what she did.

20 Q And you had connections as TMZ at the time; right? 21 A True.

22 Q You still do; right? 23 A No. Well, perhaps. 24 Q Perhaps.

25 You helped Ms. Holland get that information posted at TMZ;
16 A Yes.

10 A I made no threats to anyone.

8 You made no threats to Michael Cohen relating to the 2016 9 election; is that the answer that you give?

1912 1 right?

2 A No. 3 Q TMZ posted information relating to this incident with 4 Ms. Lohan, including aspects of her confidential patient file 5 from the facility; right? 6 A I don't know.

7 Q It's your testimony that you don't even know what I'm 8 talking about? 9 A No. I'm answering your question.

10 Q So, I just asked, did TMZ post information from 11 Ms. Lohan's confidential patient file?

12 A I don't know. 13 Q You helped Ms. Holland get paid in connection with 14 what I just described; didn't you?

15 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Overruled.

17 A I helped Ms. Holland get paid?

18 Q Correct. That's the question. 19 A I don't recall.

20 Q You don't recall that TMZ paid Ms. Holland $10,000 21 around this time?

22 A I don't recall. 23 Q She was your client; right? 24 A At some point, yes.

25 Q Is it your testimony that she was not your client in 1913 1 connection with the incident I just described?

2 A No. 3 Q So, she was your client in connection with the 4 incident I just described; correct?

5 A Well, you're describing a few different incidents. 6 I don't know what you're recalling -- what you're referring 7 to.

10 treatment at a rehab facility. 11 A I don't recall that.

12 Q And you don't recall Ms. Holland getting paid $10,000 13 by TMZ? 14 A I don't recall that.

15 Q Do you know who Tila Tequila is? 16 A I do.

17 Q And in 2010, you took steps to broker -- steps to 18 broker a deal of a sex tape involving her; correct? 19 A I believe so.

20 Q And you were working on that -- what should I call it 21 -- "engagement" -- with a man named Kevin Black?

22 A Yes. 23 Q And at the time, he was sort of known as a sex tape 24 broker; is that right?

25 A I think that's fair.

8 Q What I am referring to is the posting of information 9 regarding Ms. Lohan on TMZ, and that information related to her 1914 1 Q Is that how he was making his living in 2010?

2 A I don't know. 3 Q You just said it was "fair" to characterize him as 5 living? 6 A That's correct.

7 Q Is there a distinction? 8 A Yes. 9 Q In connection with the Tila Tequila tape, you 10 represented the client; right? 11 A Client?

12 Q That's my question. 13 A I don't recall. 14 Q You don't recall representing Francis Hall?

15 A I do not. 16 Q Do you recall that Mr. Hall, who also goes by Francis 17 Thien, threatened Ms. Tequila that if she didn't pay him 18 $75,000, the tape would be published? 19 A I don't recall that.

20 Q You don't recall at the time of that transaction, you 21 were on a 90-day Bar suspension?

22 A I don't recall that. 23 Q You know who Charlie Sheen is; right? 24 A I do.

25 Q And you've represented some clients who you helped get 4 that, but you're not sure if that was how he was making his 1915 1 paid by Charlie Sheen; right?

2 A I've represented several clients who had claims 3 against Charlie Sheen. 4 Q And who you extracted sums of money from Charlie Sheen 5 on behalf of; correct? 6 A There was no extraction.

7 Q You took steps to cause Mr. Sheen to pay; correct? 8 A We asserted that there was tortious activity committed 9 and valid settlements that were executed.

10 Q And one of those settlements involved a client named 11 Karen Montgomery; right?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And she was your client in 2011; correct? 14 A I don't recall the year.

15 Q Do you recall that Mr. Black referred her to you? 16 A I do recall that.

17 Q And do you recall that you entered into an Engagement 18 Letter with her that required a 60 percent contingency fee? 19 A I don't recall that.

20 Q Do you recall that she had recently been under the 21 influence of methamphetamine at the time you got her to sign 22 the Engagement Letter? 23 A No, I don't recall that. 24 Q You don't recall she was barely completing sentences 25 when you got her to sign the letter?

1 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

2 THE COURT: Sustained. 3 Q In connection with that representation, Charlie Sheen 4 paid $2 million; right?

5 A I have no -- I'm not gonna answer that question.

8 Q Is it fair to say that your memory seems a little 10 A I've had over 1500 clients in my career. 11 You're asking me about events that took place many, many 12 years ago. 13 Q A $2 million payment is a typical payout for you on 14 one of these cases, so much so that you don't remember it; is 15 that your testimony? 16 A I don't remember a settlement from 13 years ago.

17 Q What about Capri Anderson? Do you remember her?

19 Q And do you remember extracting another settlement from 20 Mr. Sheen while representing her? 21 A Again, it was no extraction.

22 Q You got Mr. Sheen to pay; correct? 23 A Assuming arguendo that he did pay and there was a 24 Settlement Agreement, that settlement would be confidential, 25 and I would not discuss it here.

9 fuzzy around some of these issues?

6 Q You're -- $2 million was paid to your client; correct?

7 A I don't recall.

18 A I do remember her.

1916 1917 1 Q Look. We're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer 2 games with you. 3 I'm just here to ask questions and get straight answers. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 Q I'm not asking you to assume anything.

7 I'm asking what you remember. 9 Can you answer?

10 A In answer to what? 11 Q I'm not asking you to assume anything.

12 I'm just asking for truthful answers. 13 Okay? 14 A You're getting truthful answers, sir.

15 Q So, when I ask a question, I'm not asking you to 16 assume arguendo; alright. I'm just asking for what you 17 remember.

18 A I'm not going to discuss confidential matters. 19 Q Well, that's a different answer; isn't it?

20 Now you're invoking the privilege. 21 A No, I'm not invoking the privilege.

22 And if you're not here to play legal games, then don't say 23 "extract". 24 Q Do you remember Mr. Sheen paying your client, Capri 25 Anderson?

8 All right?

1918 1 A I'm not going to discuss that.

2 MR. BOVE: Judge, I ask that the witness be 3 instructed to answer the question.

6 at sidebar:)
8 I think we need to establish, first, that he's 9 definitely not asserting any kind of privilege.

10 MR. BOVE: Okay. 11 THE COURT: Once he says he's not asserting 12 privilege, you can ask him the question again. 13 If he refuses to answer, you can ask me for help. 14 MR. BOVE: Yes.

15 Thank you. 16 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 17 in open court:)
20 A Fair. 21 Q My question is, was there a settlement between 22 Ms. Anderson and Mr. Sheen in connection with that 23 representation? 24 A I'm not going to answer that.

25 Q When you say "that", you're not invoking a privilege; 18 Q So, I want to focus on your representation of Capri 19 Anderson; okay?

7 THE COURT: So, this is a sensitive area here. 4 THE COURT: Please approach.

5 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 1919 1 correct?

2 A I'm not going to answer that question based on 3 privilege and confidentiality. 4 Q And what privilege are you invoking?

5 A The attorney-client privilege. 6 Q So, what I'm asking for is details about 7 communications between you and your client and a third-party, 8 Mr. Sheen, and maybe his representatives, maybe not. 9 Do you understand my point?

10 A No. 11 Q Is it your position that those types of communications 12 are privileged in an adversarial negotiation context? 13 A Yes.

18 Q Let's focus on 2012. 19 Okay?

16 THE COURT: You can ask him another question.

17 He's asserting privilege.

20 A Yes. 21 Q Do you recall that Gawker ran a clip from a purported 22 sex tape regarding Hulk Hogan that year? 23 A I do. 24 Q Do you recall that, prior to that post, still images 25 from one of the images appeared on The Dirty; right?

14 MR. BOVE: Your Honor, I ask that the witness be 15 instructed to answer the question.

1920 1 A Yes.

2 Q That same website that in 2011 had the post about 3 Ms. Daniels' allegations; correct? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And you used your connections at The Dirty to help get 6 the Hulk Hogan stills posted; right?

7 A No.

13 Q And you indicated to them that the Gawker post was a, 14 quote, shot across the bow; right?

15 A I don't recall that. 16 Q Do you recall that during the negotiations of 17 Mr. Hogan's representatives, you said, "I'm an expert at doing 18 this type of thing"? 19 A I don't recall that.

20 Q Do you recall discussing this issue, the conversations 21 that you had with Mr. Hogan's representatives, with Michael 22 Cohen? 23 A I do not. 24 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, if we could bring up 25 People's Exhibit 255 in evidence and go to -- this can be 8 Q You had nothing to do with that? 9 A Nothing to do with it.

10 Q And at some point in 2012, you reached out to Hulk 11 Hogan's representatives; right?

12 A Yes.

1921 1 for everybody.

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 3 MR. BOVE: If you go to the page of Bates number 4 ending 214573.

5 If we could zoom in, please, on row 53 I think it 6 is.

7 Q Now, I think you said this morning these are messages 8 between you and Mr. Cohen; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q So, does this refresh your recollection that in 11 January 2018, you were communicating with Mr. Hogan [sic] about 12 your prior dispute with Hulk Hogan and communication regarding 13 that? 14 A I was communicating with Michael Cohen about Hulk 15 Hogan.

17 You were communicating with Michael Cohen about Hulk Hogan?

18 A Yes. 19 Q So, this communication refreshes you?

20 A Yes. 21 MR. BOVE: We can take that down.

22 Q I want to go back to focusing on October 2012, and you 23 had reached out to Hulk Hogan's representatives regarding this 24 Gawker post and the sex tapes; right?

25 A Yes.

16 Q Right.

1 Q At that time, you were acting as an attorney; correct?
2 A Yes. 3 Q You had clients; right? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Who possessed the tapes; right? 6 A Yes.

10 want to keep their gay identity undercover, so we approach 11 them, too."
12 Do you remember saying that? 13 A I do not. 14 Q Do you remember demanding a million dollars?

15 A I do not. 16 Q You made a monetary demand to Hulk Hogan's 17 representatives in order to not publish these tapes; correct?

18 A No. 19 Q Did you ask for money?

20 A There was a monetary demand made. 21 Q Was it for purchase, so that Hulk Hogan could purchase 22 the tapes, the right to the tapes? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Do you recall that the National Enquirer published 25 information relating to these tapes in 2015?

1922 7 Q And you said to Hulk Hogan's representatives, did you 8 not, "We got a lot of people, they get caught on tape. They're 9 not all celebrities. We have family men that are gay, and they 1 A No.

1923 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 2 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa 3 Magniccari relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie 4 Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following 5 page.)
1924 1 (Whereupon, the proceedings are continued from 2 previous page:) 3 **** 4 MR. BOVE: This is just for parties and the 5 witness and the Court. If we can take a look at Defense 10 Q. Take a look at that and let me know when you are done. 11 A. Okay. 12 Q. Did you have a chance to take a look? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Does this refresh your recollection that the National 15 Enquirer ran stories about the tapes in the Summer of 2015? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Did they?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. And do you recall that Dylan Howard had a byline on one 20 of those articles? 21 A. I do not. 22 Q. Can you take a look at Defense F27, please, and see if 23 that refreshes your recollection? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. So Dylan Howard did, in fact, have a byline on articles 8 CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION 7 (Displayed.) 6 Exhibit F27. If we can go to Page 2, please. 9 BY MR. BOVE:
1925 1 relating to the Hulk Hogan tapes, right?

2 A. In this article, yes. 3 Q. And that's because you referred this information to 4 him, correct?

5 A. No, that's not. 6 Q. It is just happenstance?

7 A. I don't know. 8 Q. You don't know? 9 A. No, I don't know if it's happenstance.

10 Q. Did you or did you not provide information to Dylan 11 Howard so he could break the story about the content of one of 13 A. No, I did not. 14 Q. Did you cause information to be disclosed to Dylan 15 Howard so he could publish an article in the National Enquirer 16 about the content of one of these tapes?

17 A. I did not.

18 Q. And there was an FBI investigation relating to this, 19 correct?

20 A. Yes. 21 Q. You practiced criminal law in the beginning of your 22 career? 24 Q. State and Federal?

25 A. Yes.

23 A. True.

12 the tapes?

1926 1 Q. So you understand, do you not, that the FBI needs 2 enough information to actually predicate a criminal 3 investigation? 4 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

6 Q. The FBI ran a sting operation targeting your meetings 7 with Hulk Hogan's representatives, correct? 8 A. They had an investigation, yes. 9 Q. When I say "sting operation," you know what I mean, 10 right? 11 A. Not technically.

12 Q. They set up a meeting where someone was recording what 13 you were saying in connection with the negotiations?

15 Q. That was at a hotel, right? 16 A. Yes.

17 Q. And the FBI was sitting a couple of doors down, 19 A. I don't know. They were in close proximity.

20 Q. They were in close proximity monitoring the situation, 21 right?

22 A. I presume so.

25 A. Yes.

24 authorities, correct? 23 Q. You know that this was also investigated by local 18 correct?

5 THE COURT: Sustained.

14 A. Yes.

1927 1 Q. And that there was a report issued relating to the two 2 investigations, and the local authorities? 3 A. There was a report issued. 4 Q. Do you recall that? 5 A. (No response.) 8 Q. If you can take a look at Defense F35, please. 9 I'm going to hand you a copy so you could flip through.

10 Have you had a chance to look at that? 11 A. It's 31 pages. I have looked at that. 12 Q. My question is: Does that refresh your recollection 13 that the Tampa Police Department issued a report relating to the 14 investigation that we have been talking about? 15 A. I didn't -- yes. 16 Q. Do you recall that in that report the Tampa Police 17 Department indicated that the operation --
18 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 19 THE COURT: Sustained. 20 Q. You can put the document to the side. 21 Thank you. 22 The Tampa Police Department referenced concerns about 23 extortion in connection with this investigation, correct? 24 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 25 THE COURT: I will allow it.

6 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, this is for the Court and 7 the parties and the witness.

1928 1 You can answer it.

2 A. They conducted an investigation, yes. 3 Q. An investigation relating to extortion, right? 4 A. I believe so. 5 Q. And there were conclusions about concerns relating to 6 extortion; just yes or no? 7 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 8 THE COURT: Sustained. 9 Q. And you were not ultimately charged, right?

10 A. True. 11 Q. But that experience gave you familiarity with extortion 12 law, correct? 13 A. Perhaps. I -- I don't know. 14 Q. Do you know who Gabriel Rueda is? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. And he had a dispute with CBS and Manny Pacquiao? 17 A. "Dispute" is loosely used.

18 Q. He felt that he was owed a finder's fee relating to one 19 of Mr. Pacquiao's fights, right? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. A big fight? 22 A. Yes. 24 A. Yes. 23 Q. With Floyd Mayweather? 25 Q. You tried to convince Mr. Rueda to settle that dispute, 1929 1 right?

2 A. I offered him a settlement. 3 Q. He felt he was owed millions and millions and millions 4 of dollars, right?

5 A. A hundred million dollars. 6 Q. One hundred million dollars?

7 A. Yes. 8 Q. You offered him $50,000, correct?

10 Q. You made a settlement offer to him, right? 11 A. Yes.

12 Q. And it involved a sum of money that was much less than 13 100 million dollars? 14 A. It was far less than 100 million dollars.

15 Q. On June 25, 2015, you told Mr. Rueda he was dealing 16 with powerful people who did not care if Rueda got hurt, right?

17 A. I never ever said that. I did not say that.

18 Q. You also threatened he would not be able to find work 19 in California if he did not accept your settlement, correct?

20 A. That's false. 21 Q. Now, I want to get back to the clients that you talked 22 about in this case. 23 A. Fair. 24 Q. Let start with Ms. McDougal. I think you said that 25 your attorney-client relationship started in June 2016, right?

9 A. No.

1930 1 A. I believe so.

2 Q. By that time, there was someone else leaking 5 A. I don't know about that, about leaking. Ms. McDougal 6 had a friend, and when your client was ascending in the polls, 7 one of Ms. McDougal's former friends attempted to publicize 8 Ms. McDougal's interactions with your client. 9 Q. That is Gary Stevens, right?

10 A. I don't know. 11 Q. Do you remember telling the District Attorney's office 12 that Ms. McDougal had a friend who was trying to publish a story 13 without her consent? 14 A. Telling whom? 15 Q. That there was a friend of Ms. McDougal's who was 16 trying to publish a story without her consent? 17 A. Who did I say that to?

18 Q. The District Attorney's office. 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. At the time, you said that you knew who you were 21 talking about, right? 22 A. I don't know if I ever heard that name Stevens. 23 Q. I think you testified on direct that your fee in 24 connection with the representation of Ms. McDougal is 45 25 percent; is that right?

3 information publicly about this alleged relationship between Ms. 4 McDougal and President Trump, right?

1 A. I believe so.

2 Q. You testified on direct that Jay Grdina had introduced 3 you to Ms. McDougal; is that right? 4 A. No.

5 Q. You knew Ms. McDougal for a while, but Jay came to you 6 about this particular representation?

8 Q. Jay Grdina had been a client of yours? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Jay has a brother, correct? 11 A. Yes.

15 A. I do. 16 Q. So James was married to McDougal, correct?

17 A. That's my understanding.

18 Q. There was sort of a referral chain for how you became 19 involved in 2016?

20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And you mentioned somebody named John Crawford; do you 22 remember that?

25 two?

1931 12 Q. Named James? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. If I call him James, you know who I am talking about?

23 A. Yes. 24 Q. I think you said he provided security at a meeting or 7 A. Yes.

1932

1 A. He was, I think, a retired police officer from Phoenix.

2 Q. He also owns some UPS stores in Phoenix?
3 A. True. That's my understanding, that he owned UPS 4 stores. 5 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, can we please take a look 6 at People's 279 in evidence. This can be for everybody.

7 Can we zoom in on the email, please. 8 (Displayed.)
9 Q. So I think we looked at this on Tuesday. This is 10 you submitting a proposed Engagement Letter to Ms. McDougal, 11 right? 12 A. Yes. 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. That JG, is that Jay Grdina? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Why did you include him on the BCC line?

18 A. I don't know. 19 Q. And this document was never executed, right? 20 A. I don't know if there was a Retainer Agreement that was 21 executed. 22 Q. Do you know if it's the one that is attached to the 23 email or a different letter? 24 A. I don't know.

25 Q. You said you got a subpoena at some point from the
13 Q. Do you see the BCC line?

1933 1 District Attorney's office?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And did you search your files for the signed version of 4 this letter? 5 A. I believe so. 6 Q. And is it fair to say you did not find one? 7 A. I provided whatever was located. 8 Q. My point is: There was nothing wrong in terms of your 9 relationship with Ms. McDougal that it wasn't signed?

10 A. It was my recollection that I had a fully executed -- 11 excuse me -- a Retention Agreement with Ms. McDougal. 15 Q. I am focused on Paragraph 4.2, where it seems to 16 indicate that the fee contemplated in this letter was 35 17 percent.

18 Do you see that? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Do you recall a subsequent negotiation that increased 21 your fee to 45 percent? 22 A. I don't recall that conversation. 23 Q. And now the difference between these two numbers, 35 24 and 45 percent, on the $150,000 payment, is 10 percent, about 25 15 grand, right?

13 Paragraph 4.2 and the subparagraphs. 14 (Displayed.) 12 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, can we take a look at 1934 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And some of the fee that you were paid was split, 3 correct? 4 A. No. 5 Q. So is it your testimony that Jay Grdina made nothing in 6 connection with the payment of the $150,000? 7 A. He was compensated. 8 Q. Out of the legal fees, correct? 9 A. No.

10 Q. What about John Crawford? 11 A. He was compensated as well. 12 Q. He was compensated out of your fee? Yes or no? 13 A. No. 14 Q. You know -- do you know that the California Ethnics 18 Q. You have been disciplined on that basis, correct? 24 Q. This was sent right around the time that you went to 25 Phoenix to meet with Ms. McDougal, Mr. Grdina, and Mr. Crawford, 16 right?

19 A. No. 20 Q. So we'll go back to the first page of the email. 21 Can you see it? 22 That is dated June 15, 2016?

15 Rules prohibit non-attorneys from being paid out of legal fees, 17 A. Correct.

23 A. Yes.

1 correct?

1935 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. Before the meeting, you had already talked to Dylan 4 Howard, right? 5 A. I don't recall. 6 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, if we can take a look at 7 People's 176A. 8 I would like to go to the page with the text 9 messages on June 7, 2016.

10 Zoom in on the rows beginning 11-111. 11 (Displayed.) 12 Q. Have you had a chance to take a look? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. These are messages dated June 7, 2016, between you and 15 Dylan Howard? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. In these messages, you indicated, "I have a blockbuster 19 Do you see that on the top? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. You were reaching out to Dylan Howard to tell him about 22 Ms. McDougal's allegations, correct? 23 A. Not necessarily. 24 Q. You were reaching out to Mr. Howard to get him 25 interested in the potential story, right? 18 Trump story."
1936 1 A. I think that's fair.

2 Q. And it would make -- it would make you look better when 3 you went to Phoenix to be able to say, "I have already got the 4 National Enquirer interested in this," correct? 5 A. I don't know about that. 8 potential story; is that your testimony? 9 A. No, that's not my testimony.

10 Q. So it was helpful to you to be able to say to Karen 11 McDougal and Jay Grdina, in mid June of 2016, you had already 12 communicated with the National Enquirer, right? 13 A. Maybe, or maybe not. Perhaps. 14 Q. And this is one of the ways your relationship with 16 A. I don't see that the two are related. 17 Q. You testified on Tuesday about a meeting that you had 18 with Ms. McDougal in Los Angeles. 19 Do you remember that? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. I think you showed some text messages. We eventually 22 got to the point where you remembered that the meeting was on 23 June 20, 2016? 24 A. I believe so. 25 Q. Mr. Howard travelled to Los Angeles for the meeting, 15 Dylan Howard benefited your law practice, right?

6 Q. It did not help you gain trust with the client to be 7 able to say that you had already generated interest in the 1937 1 right?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. At the meeting was also Ms. McDougal? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Jay Grdina? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Mr. Crawford, correct? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And the purpose of that meeting was for Dylan Howard to 10 sort of vet Ms. McDougal's story, right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. You knew he was going to take the information and his 13 observations and report back to AMI's leadership, right? 14 A. To David Pecker. 15 Q. To Mr. Pecker, the top of the totem pole of AMI? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. You were informed, were you not, the next day, AMI was 18 not interested? 19 A. Yes, I was informed at that time they were not 20 interested. 21 Q. I think we saw a text message where Mr. Howard wrote to 22 you that AMI was "immovable." 23 Do you remember that? 24 A. Vaguely. 25 Q. And the issue was, one of them, that AMI felt 1938 1 McDougal had not provided enough corroborating information, 2 right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Meaning, evidence to back up her story, correct? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And that is why shortly thereafter you texted 7 Mr. Howard, you said, "Ms. McDougal found her Blackberry," 8 right? 9 A. But he asked her to locate additional documents and --
11 Q. It was in response to that request you wrote to Mr. 12 Howard shortly after the meeting, "She found her Blackberry?" 13 A. Correct. 14 Q. There were efforts made to take information off that 16 A. I don't know about that. 17 Q. The Blackberry ended up not moving the needle for AMI
18 in terms of corroboration, correct? 19 A. I don't know. 20 Q. There was no conversation that you were a party to 21 where AMI said, "Oh, great, now that we know the Blackberry 22 exists, let's move forward with the story," right? 23 A. I never had that conversation. 24 Q. In this same month, June 2016, things had broken down 25 enough that you sent a message to Mr. Howard indicating you were 10 so, yes. 15 Blackberry, right?

1939 1 drafting a Declination Letter.

2 Do you remember that? 3 A. I don't recall that. 4 MR. BOVE: If we can take a look at Government 5 Exhibit 176A, Page 3. 6 Zoom in on 1115 and 56. 9 Q. Does this refresh your recollection that you told 10 Mr. Howard in June 2016 that you were drafting a Declination 11 Letter? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. You were, correct? 14 A. I don't recall. I -- I don't recall. 15 Q. At this point, Ms. McDougal started to negotiate with 16 other companies, right? 17 A. I don't know.

18 THE COURT: Is this a good time to stop? 19 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge. 20 THE COURT: Jurors, we'll start back up at 2:15. 21 Do not discuss the case among yourselves or with 22 anyone else. 23 Pleas keep an open mind as to the defendant's 24 guilt or innocence. 25 Please do not form or express an opinion as to the 7 (Displayed.) 8 THE WITNESS: Yes. Okay.

1940 1 defendant's guilt or incense.

2 Enjoy your lunch. 3 (Jury leaving courtroom.) 5 Thank you, sir. 6 You may step down. 7 (Witness leaving courtroom.) 8 THE COURT: Mr. Bove, I am not rushing you at all. 9 I want to get a sense of how much more you have.

10 MR. BOVE: I will make some adjustments at the 11 lunch break. I expect it's under an hour. 12 THE COURT: Thank you. 13 Enjoy your lunch. 14 (Whereupon, the Court took a luncheon recess.) 15 ***** 16 21 MS. NECHELES: There is one issue, if I could have 22 a few minutes to discuss. 23 I wanted to raise an issue about the Gag Order and 24 just some clarification before we start. 25 If I could hand up some articles here, and give a 4 THE COURT: Please be seated.

20 we bring the witness out? 19 Is there anything that we need to discuss before 17 A-F-T-E-R-N-O-O-N S-E-S-S-I-O-N .

18 THE COURT: Good afternoon.

1941 1 copy.

5 People like, the first one is entitled "Trump's 6 New York Prosecution is a Bogus Case by Bogus Prosecutors." 7 And these articles are by a number of legal 8 commentators, including Jonathan Turley and Andrew 9 McCarthy.

10 These articles are all articles which President 11 Trump would like to post on his Truth, but they all discuss 12 this case. They discuss witnesses who have testified. 13 They discuss what the aspects of the case are. 14 They're very critical of this case. They're 15 important for his election campaign. They're talking about 16 the kinds of issues that he has been raising. 17 But he has some concerns because they do mention 19 name. 20 We think they are perfectly fine, but we think 21 there is some ambiguity in the Gag Order. 22 So we're asking for your Honor to take a look at 23 them so that he knows he is not violating the Gag Order 24 when he posts this. 25 THE COURT: People? 18 witnesses. They mention the prosecutors in this case by 3 Your Honor, I just handed up a stack of newspaper 4 articles by legal commentators and others. 2 Thank you.

1942 1 MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, first of all, we've just 2 been handed this stack. If anything, we need to go through 3 them. 4 But it seems odd that they're asking the Court for 5 sort of an advanced ruling on these kinds of things. 6 I think the Gag Order is very specific. 7 So I guess my first request would be to have some 8 time to look at it. 9 We don't want to be in this position either. If 10 they're talking about witnesses in the case, people that 11 the defendant is not supposed to be talking about based 12 on the Gag Order -- I understand and fully respect that 13 there is a political campaign going on. There is also a 14 criminal case going on in this courtroom. That's what the 15 Order is seeking to protect. I think we need to really be 16 careful with this situation. 17 THE COURT: I appreciate what you are bringing to 18 my attention, Ms. Necheles. 19 I'm not going to give advanced rulings. I'm not 20 going to be in a position of looking at posts and 21 determining in advance whether you should or should not 22 post these on Truth Social as part of your official 23 campaign website. 24 There is no ambiguity in the Order. The Appellate 25 Division has already weighed in on that.

1943 1 We'll see where it goes from there.

2 At this point, this Court and the higher court 3 have found there is nothing wrong with the Gag Order. 4 I think the best advice you can give your client 5 is to do without, steer clear. 6 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I hear what you are 7 saying. I heard what the Appellate Court has ruled. I 8 think they're ruling in the abstract. I believe there is 9 ambiguity.

10 THE COURT: I am not going to argue with you. 11 If you have an issue, take it up to the Appellate Division. 12 Take it up to the Court of Appeals. I am not revisiting my 13 Order. I am not going to. 14 MS. NECHELES: What we're seeking a clarification 15 on, when the witnesses have testified, or when there is an 16 analysis of the case and it mentions witnesses, or it 17 mentions that the prosecutors made certain arguments in 18 this Court, or the prosecutors were appointed by a certain 19 Justice, these are people who are analyzing the case and 20 talking about it being a political hit. That is what 21 President Trump wants to be arguing at its core. 22 And I, frankly, don't know whether that violates 23 the Gag Order. 24 THE COURT: I am not going to give you an advanced 25 ruling on this.

1944 1 Let's get the witness.

2 I think, when it doubt, steer clear. That's all I 3 can say. 4 (Witness entering courtroom.) 5 *** 6 THE COURT: Good afternoon sir. 7 Let's get the jury. 8 THE CLERK: Do all parties stipulate that all 9 jurors are present and properly seated?

10 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. 11 MR. BOVE: Yes. 12 THE COURT: Good afternoon, jurors. 13 MR. BOVE: May I? 14 THE COURT: Yes. 15 CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION 16 BY MR. BOVE: 17 Q. Mr. Davidson, I would like to talk a little bit more 18 about the 2011 blog post. 20 Gina Rodriguez, right? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Who you said was Stormy Daniels' manager for a long 23 period of time, right? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Perhaps on and off at times? 19 You have testified a little bit about a woman named 1945 1 A. I'm not sure.

2 Q. But in 2011, Gina Rodriguez was Stormy Daniels' 3 manager, correct? 4 A. That's my understanding. 5 Q. And you referenced at times that Gina Rodriguez had a 6 boyfriend that was involved in some of these things, right? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And his name was Anthony Kotsev? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Am I pronouncing that right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Isn't it a fact that Mr. Kotsev actually wrote the blog 13 post that was put on The Dirty in 2011? 14 A. I don't know. He was an employee of The Dirty. 15 Q. You don't recall saying that to the Government? 16 A. I recall that. 17 Q. The Dirty was owned, in part, by James Grdina, right?

18 A. I don't think so. 19 Q. He worked there, correct? 20 A. James Grdina? 21 Q. Yes. 22 A. I don't know. 23 Q. And James Grdina is Karen McDougal's ex-husband, right? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. James Grdina and Jay Grdina are brothers, right?

1946 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And Jay Grdina brokered your connection to Ms. McDougal 3 in that representation? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And is also connected to Gina Rodriguez, right? 6 A. Jay? 7 Q. Jay, right. 8 A. I don't think so. 9 Q. So it's your testimony that Jay Grdina has never worked 10 with Gina Rodriguez? 11 A. I don't know. 12 Q. So let's focus then on that 2011 representation of 13 Stormy Daniels. 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. The reason that you were able to get that blog post 16 taken down is because Gina Rodriguez's boyfriend had written it, 17 correct?

18 A. I don't know who wrote it, but I don't think they were 19 dating at the time. 20 Q. It's your testimony that Gina Rodriguez did not -- was 21 not involved with Anthony Kotsev in 2011? 22 A. I don't know if she was. I don't think she would have 23 needed me, she would have called her boyfriend. 24 Q. You used this network of connections to get the blog 25 post taken down, correct?

1947

1 A. In addition to the Cease and Desist.
2 Q. You practiced law for a long time, right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. You won cases in court? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. This Cease and Desist Letter was not one of your 7 greatest litigation victories? 8 A. It was a form letter. 9 Q. It was a form letter created in that context because 10 you had connections to The Dirty? 11 A. I certainly followed the Cease and Desist up with a 12 phone call. 13 Q. Isn't it a fact that the reason that Ms. Daniels and 14 Ms. Rodriguez wanted that blog post taken down, they were trying 15 to negotiate a better deal with In Touch magazine? 16 A. That's a fact that I learned later, yes. 17 Q. They were using you in connection with them?

18 A. I don't understand your question. They were using my 19 efforts to create an exclusive opportunity with a different 20 publication. 21 Q. And that exclusive opportunity was more valuable to 22 Ms. Daniels, right? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. They were using you to make more money, right? 25 A. Yes.

1948 1 Q. Now, you testified about some public statements that 2 Ms. Daniels made in January 2018, correct? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. At around this time, Larry Flynt offered to indemnify 5 Stormy Daniels in connection with any litigation arising out of 6 the Settlement Agreement, correct?

7 A. There were others. I was not involved. It's my 8 understanding there were other terms as well.

12 A. Yes. 13 Q. Indemnify means he would be paying her legal bills, 14 correct?

15 A. True. 16 Q. You testified this morning about some stress that you 17 perceived Ms. Daniels to be going through in January 2018 18 relating to this agreement, right? 19 A. Yes.

20 Q. In fact, she had this opportunity to have her legal 21 fees paid if she wanted to fight the Agreement, right?

22 A. Yes. But you can -- even if someone is going to pay 23 your legal bills, it's still an obstruction in your life. Yes. 24 Q. From your perspective, this Settlement Agreement was a 25 valid legal document, right?

9 Q. But one of the terms, if there was going to be 10 litigation relating to the Settlement Agreement that you helped 11 to negotiate, he would indemnify her?

1949 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. You had negotiated it, right? 3 A. True. 4 Q. It had legal terms, right? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And it was certainly consistent with your beliefs about 7 your ethnical obligations, right? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. You didn't do anything wrong in connection with that 10 agreement, right? 11 A. I don't believe so. 12 Q. I want to talk a little bit about your relationship 13 with Michael Cohen. 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. You continued to work with him after the Stormy Daniels 16 settlement, right?

18 Q. On other matters? 19 A. Not with him. But I continued to certainly speak with 20 him, correspond with him. He was opposing counsel on another 21 matter. 22 Q. And he sent you some business, right? 23 A. He sent me work. 24 Q. He sent you a client? 25 A. He sent me a non-paying client.

17 A. Yes.

1950 1 Q. So it's not as if the experience with him was so 3 A. No, our relationship changed over time. 4 Q. And, in 2018, had you heard the name Summer Zervos?

5 A. I believe so.

7 A. I can't recall. 8 Q. What about Justin Best? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. That's the client he was talking about, right? 11 A. Yes.

12 Q. So this is a situation where Mr. Cohen referred you a 13 client? 14 A. Yes.

15 Q. And you accepted that, right? 16 A. Yes.

17 Q. Because you were continuing to work together, correct?

18 A. No. 19 Q. You were continuing to interact professionally, right?

20 A. That's fair. 21 Q. And you also had a client named Shera Bechard?

22 A. I had a client named Shera Bechard. 23 Q. She retained you in about November 2017, correct? 24 A. I'm not sure of the date.

25 Q. Late 2017, give or take?
6 Q. Did you discuss Summer Zervos with Mr. Cohen?

2 horrific that you ceased interacting with him, correct?

1951 1 A. I would have to look. That doesn't strike me as wrong.

2 Q. And she had made allegations about a sexual 3 relationship with a man named Elliott Broidy? 4 A. I think that's been publicly reported. 5 Q. Just so I understand the privilege analysis, if 6 something from your perspective -- if something is publicly 7 reported, you are comfortable reporting privileged conversations 8 about it? 9 A. No.

10 Q. You are aware of the public reports about Ms. Bechard's 11 allegations? 12 A. I was aware of the public reporting of her allegations. 13 Q. She was your client? 16 A. Ultimately. 17 Q. There was a Settlement Agreement, correct?

18 A. True. 19 Q. This Settlement Agreement was legal work for you, 20 right? 21 A. I don't understand the question. 22 Q. You were practicing law when you negotiated the 23 Agreement? 24 A. True. 25 Q. So was Mr. Cohen, as far you could tell?

15 Q. Mr. Cohen represented Mr. Broidy? 14 A. Yes.

1952 1 A. True.

2 Q. It resolved in a contract? 3 A. True. 4 Q. It probably had terms like the ones you negotiated on 5 behalf of Ms. Daniels, correct? 6 A. I would imagine.

7 Q. Maybe with one notable exception, that the dollar 8 figure was a lot higher right? 9 A. I don't recall.

10 Q. You don't recall that the settlement was for 1.6 11 million dollars to be paid in installments?

12 A. I don't recall. 13 Q. As you sit here today, you don't recall events from 14 2018; is that your testimony?

15 A. I don't recall specific dollar amounts in a Settlement 16 Agreement from six some-odd years ago.

17 Q. Even after this settlement between Ms. Bechard and 18 Mr. Broidy, you continued to communicate with Mr. Cohen, right? 19 A. I believe so.

20 Q. Well, I mean, you know -- so we looked at the text 21 messages, right?

22 A. Yes. 23 Q. You remember this morning, correct? 24 A. Yes, I remember this morning.

25 Q. The text messages from January 2018, right?

1953 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. They continued in February 2018, right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And March 2018, correct?

5 A. Yes. 6 Q. In the context of those discussions, did you ever talk 7 to Mr. Cohen about Stormy Daniels having "settler's remorse?" 8 A. I may have. 9 Q. And do you recall in that conversation also using the 10 word "leverage?" 11 A. No.

12 Q. Is "leverage" a word that you used in conversations 13 with Mr. Cohen? 14 A. I may have.

15 Q. And you did, in fact, in March of 2018, correct? 16 A. Use the word "leverage?"
18 Daniels? 19 A. I don't know.

20 Q. During meetings with the District Attorney's office, 21 they asked you questions about whether Mr. Cohen had ever 22 recorded your conversations, correct? 23 A. I don't recall if it was -- what agencies. It came up 24 at some point in an interview.

25 Q. And I think you said, did you not, "Yeah, I was under 17 Q. In a conversation with Michael Cohen about Stormy 1954 1 the impression that he did record some of these talks?"
2 A. Certainly, I recall a few conversations when I was 3 speaking with Mr. Cohen when his conversations were odd, and 4 that led me to believe that I was being recorded. 5 Q. I think you said the reason they seemed odd to you, he 6 was talking in a linear fashion? 7 A. Yes. Because, ordinarily, he was sort of all over the 8 place. In these particular calls, it was a very structured 9 conversation, which really wasn't his personality.

10 Q. Less pants on fire, more straightforward? 11 A. Maybe a little bit more self-serving. 12 Q. Do you recall saying to Michael Cohen on March 7, 2018, 13 "Sometimes people get settler's remorse, you know, and other 14 times people think that, hey, I need to resolve this case 15 before a date certain because this is when I have the most?" 16 A. No. 17 MR. BOVE: If we can bring up for the parties, the 18 Court and the witness, Defense Exhibit F15-AT. 20 I think the way this works, there is a dial in the middle. 21 I'm told if you put the volume up above two, 22 there's a risk of catastrophic damage to your ears. 23 Thank you. 24 Q. So we're going to play Defense Exhibit F158A over the 25 headphones. 19 There is also a set of headphones on the bench.

1 I'm going to ask you to listen to see if it refreshes 2 your recollection about whether you said what I just said. 3 A. Are you playing it? 4 Q. I think it might help, that's the receiver, whatever 5 you call this, it should come on. 7 A. If you could restart it. 8 (Whereupon, witness was given headphones to listen 9 to audio recording.)
10 MR. BOVE: Restart it, please. 11 (Whereupon, audio recording was played for the 12 witness and the Court only.) 13 THE WITNESS: Is this the beginning? 14 THE COURT: Play it one more time. 15 MR. BOVE: Start it from the beginning. 16 (Whereupon, the witness and the Court listened to 17 audio recording.)
18 MR. BOVE: Stop it. 19 Q. So, Mr. Davidson, it continues. We're going to go back 20 to it. 21 That was your voice? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Does that refresh your recollection that you said to 24 Mr. Cohen, "Sometimes people get settler's remorse, you know, 25 and other times people think, hey, I need to resolve this case 6 Any luck?

1955 1956 1 before a date certain because this is when I have the most."
2 What you just listened to, does it refresh your 3 recollection that you said that? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. You were talking about Stormy Daniels here, correct? 6 A. Probably. 7 Q. Just yes or no; were you talking about Stormy Daniels 8 with Michael Cohen on March 7, 2018? 9 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

10 THE COURT: Overruled. 11 If you could answer yes or no. 12 A. It certainly appears to be, yes. 13 Q. And do you see the reference to "before a date 14 certain?" 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. That's something you said to Mr. Cohen in March 2018, 17 right?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. And that is a comment that you were attributing in 20 substance to Ms. Daniels, correct? 21 A. Not necessarily. 22 Q. I am asking you: What was going on in your head at the 23 time? 24 A. What time?

25 Q. When you had said these things.
1957 1 A. This is 2018; yes? I don't know what time you are 2 referring to. 3 Q. When you said what is written on the page, were you 4 referring in substance to something that Ms. Daniels had 5 conveyed to you? 6 A. I don't believe so.

7 Q. And when you use -- do you see where it says 8 "hypothetically speaking?" 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. That was a code, right? 11 A. No.

12 Q. Because you were using the word "hypothetical," so you 13 could sit in a chair like this and say, "I'm not sure if I was 14 talking about Stormy Daniels?"
15 A. No. 16 Q. Do you recall saying during the same conversation with 17 Mr. Cohen, "Well, if things don't turn out the way that you 18 thought they were going to turn out, and now you're realizing 19 you have a lot more leverage, you tried to settle it twice?"
20 A. Can I see the transcript? 21 Q. Yes.

22 A. Thank you. 23 MR. BOVE: So we're going to bring up Defense 24 Exhibit F15-AT again.

25 (Displayed.)
1958 1 Q. I want to do whatever I can to refresh your 2 recollection. 3 Is the transcript sufficient? 4 A. That's fine. Thanks. 5 Q. Does looking at the transcript refresh your 6 recollection that you had said that to Mr. Cohen in March of 7 2018? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And you use the word "leverage," correct?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. And that was Ms. Daniels' goal, was it not, to create 12 leverage over President Trump? 13 A. No. 14 Q. Do you recall saying during that same conversation, 15 "If someone like Larry Flynt or someone else comes in and says, 16 I will give you 1 million dollars, but first you got to get out 17 of the Agreement, hypothetically speaking;" do you recall saying 18 that to Mr. Cohen on March 7, 2018? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. That was a reference to Larry Flynt? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Who made the offer to Ms. Daniels, right? 24 Q. Does that refresh your recollection that this entire 25 conversation is about Ms. Daniels? 23 A. Yes.

1959

1 A. Yes. But I think you are grossly mistaken about it.
2 Q. There is no question pending. 3 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection. 4 I would ask that the witness be allowed to answer. 5 THE COURT: You can go ahead and answer the 6 question. 9 potential breach, where Larry Flynt had offered to give 10 Ms. Daniels 1 million dollars plus indemnify her from any legal 11 costs because she wanted to get out of the Settlement Agreement 12 that she had entered into two years before. 13 Q. Which is shorthand for "settler's remorse," correct, 14 which was your phrase? 15 A. That's true. 16 Q. Now, at some point, Ms. Daniels got new counsel, right? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Michael Avenatti? 19 A. True. 20 Q. And Gina Rodriguez continued to work with Ms. Daniels 21 in that timeframe, right? 22 A. For a period. 23 Q. So for some period of time Ms. Daniels' legal 24 representation was Mr. Avennati, assisted in that agent capacity 25 that we talked about by Gina Rodriguez?

7 A. I think you are grossly mistaken about the date. This 8 is years after the settlement, and this is talking about a 1960 1 A. For some period of time.

2 Q. And, certainly, that was the case in, let's say, the 3 second third of 2018? 4 A. I don't know. It's my recollection that Miss 5 Rodriguez's tenure did not last for very long once Mr. Avennati 6 came in. 7 Q. Do you recall saying to Michael Cohen, "Avennati has 8 really driven a wedge, a serious wedge between Stormy and Gina. 9 Avennati is leaning on Gina, saying, you know, basically, we 10 know we're lying. We know we're full of shit in the media. We 11 know that she was never threatened in Las Vegas. We know all 12 these things." 13 Do you recall saying that to Mr. Cohen? 14 A. That sounds like something I recall. 15 Q. Yes or no; do you recall saying that to Mr. Cohen? 16 A. I don't doubt I said that. I don't have a specific 17 recollection of that quote.

18 Q. That's fair. 19 MR. BOVE: We'll listen it. You can put the 20 headphones back on, please. 21 I am going to ask Mr. Bernik to play Defense F17C, 22 which corresponds to the transcript. 23 (Whereupon, the witness, using the headphones, 24 played the audio recording.) 25 Q. Does that refresh your recollection that you did say 1961 1 those things to Michael Cohen on April 4th of 2018?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. That was your voice on Defense Exhibit F17C? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. In that same timeframe, April 2018, you did some public 6 interviews, right? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. I believe CNN? 9 A. I believe so.

10 Q. You talked with Michael Cohen about the questions and 11 answers during the interviews, right? 12 A. Can you rephrase your question, please? 13 Q. Did you speak to Michael Cohen about your CNN 14 interviews? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Do you recall saying this to Michael Cohen about one of 17 the interviews:
18 "The $130,000, was there ever any indication that the 19 money was coming from --" 20 Answer is: "No." 21 "Was there ever any indication that Michael Cohen 22 needed authority from Donald Trump before he made that payment?" 23 And I said: "No, it was never discussed." 24 Do you recall saying that to Michael Cohen? 25 A. Vaguely.

1962 1 Q. Go back to the headphones.

2 A. It's fine. 3 Q. I appreciate it. 4 MR. BOVE: Let me state it for the record. We're 5 now going to play Defense F17A, with the corresponding 6 transcript which is dash 18. 7 (Whereupon, audio recording was played for the 8 witness and Court only.) 9 A. I think the wrong transcript is up.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q. Please stop that there. 12 Does that refresh your recollection that you said to 13 Mr. Cohen: "Was there ever any indication that Michael Cohen 14 needed authority from Donald Trump before he made that payment? 15 And I said, No, it was never discussed." 16 You said that, right? 17 A. That's true.

18 Q. You also in that conversation with Michael Cohen said, 19 "And why would an attorney have ever asked opposing counsel what 20 kind of conversations they had with their client." 21 You said that, right? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And you believed that, right? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And the same way you invoked the privilege here, 1 correct?

1963 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And Michael Cohen didn't breach any privilege in 4 talking to you about the Stormy Daniels negotiations, did he? 5 A. Not that I am aware of. 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. You said that, right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. In this timeframe, around the time of the CNN 13 interview, April 2018, do you recall speaking with Michael Cohen 14 about Gina Rodriguez and Mr. Kotsev? 15 A. No. 16 Q. Do you recall saying to Mr. Cohen, "Gina Rodriguez's 17 boyfriend goes out in the media and tells the story that Stormy 18 Daniels, you know, in the weeks prior to the election was 19 basically yelling and screaming and calling me a pussy." 20 Do you recall saying that to Mr. Cohen? 21 A. I don't. 22 MR. BOVE: So if we could bring up the transcript 23 on the screen, please, Defense Exhibit F17-ET, and play the 24 corresponding audio, Defense F17-E, please. 25 (Whereupon, the witness, using the headphones, 6 Q. And in that conversation later, did you or did you not 7 say: "Look, it's the truth, Michael, you know that, but I think 8 that you and I both want the truth out there?"
1964

## 1 Played Audio.)

2 Q. Does that refresh your recollection that you said that 3 to Michael Cohen around the time of the CNN interview? 4 A. I don't know what date the CNN interview was, but I 5 said it on April 4th. 9 imagine. I remember hearing her on the phone saying: You 10 fucking Keith Davidson, you better settle this goddamn story 11 because if he loses this election, and he is going to lose, if 12 he loses this election, we all lose all fucking leverage. This 13 case is worth zero." 14 Do you recall saying that to Mr. Cohen?

15 A. I do.
19 A. I do. 20 Q. I would like you to take a look at the Agreement that 21 you negotiated on behalf of Ms. Daniels. People's 26 in 22 evidence. 23 This could be for everyone. 24 From your perspective, this is a legal document? 25 A. Yes.

6 Q. Do you recall also saying to Mr. Cohen, "I wouldn't be 7 the least bit surprised if he comes out and says, you know what, 8 Stormy Daniels, she wanted this money more than you could ever 16 Q. Do you remember at the beginning of my questions when I 17 asked about whether the election was used as a leverage point in 18 connection with the Stormy Daniels negotiations?

1965 1 Q. The type of Settlement Agreement that you've negotiated 2 many times over the course of your career, correct? 3 A. That's fair. 4 Q. You've negotiated nondisclosure provisions? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And you did that here on behalf of Stormy Daniels as an 7 attorney, correct? 8 A. Yes. Yes. 9 Q. There isn't fake language designed to hide something, 10 right? 11 A. I don't know. It's a very long document. It's not 12 fake language. 13 Q. It has copyright provisions, right? 14 A. A Transfer of Copyright. 15 Q. I don't know what that means, honestly. 16 It's a serious legal part of this agreement, right? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. So if we can take a look at Bates ending 021. 19 This is the Copyright Transfer, right? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. You have used similar documents like this before, 22 right? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. In the course of your practice on behalf of other 25 clients, right?

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. You did that here because you were trying to help 3 Ms. Daniels negotiate an Agreement, right? 4 A. This was the Agreement, yes.

5 Q. And these are valid terms from your perspective, 6 right?

7 A. Yes. 8 Q. As is the rest of the agreement? 9 A. I believe so.

10 MR. BOVE: If we could look at the Bates ending 11 020, please.

12 (Displayed.) 13 Q. This is the signature page, right? 14 A. Yes.

15 MR. BOVE: And can we zoom in on the signature, 16 please.

17 (Displayed.)
18 Q. And I think you said Mr. Cohen signed at the bottom, 19 right?

20 A. Yes. 21 Q. There is an "Esquire" by his name?

22 A. Yes. 23 Q. From your perspective, he signed this agreement as an 24 attorney, correct?

25 A. Yes.

1966 1967

1 Q. There is a blank for David Dennison?

2 A. Yes.
3 Q. You don't know one way or the other what happened with 4 this agreement after you sent it to Michael Cohen? 5 A. I do not. 6 Q. It's unsigned here, correct? 7 A. True.

11 Q. This is another signature page, correct? 12 A. What was the last page, Page 15? 13 Q. We'll back up one page, please. 14 A. It's just a continuation of the signature block. 15 Q. Look at 017 -- 016. This is the end part of the main 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Now, go back to the signature page, 017. 19 It's blank here as well in the DD space, right? 20 A. Yes. Yes. 21 Q. That's the initials for David Dennison? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. This is a practice that you used before, using initials 24 in the main body of the Agreement? 25 A. It's common.

8 MR. BOVE: If we can take that down and look at 9 Bates 017.

16 agreement?

1968 1 Q. You even used it with Hulk Hogan, right?

2 A. I believe so.

3 Q. This is unsigned, correct? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. You don't know one way or the other whether it was 6 signed by DD?

7 A. By DD; yes.

25 Q Hello, Mr. Davidson.

9 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

1970 1 A Hello.

2 Q On cross-examination, Mr. Bove asked you several 3 questions about a recorded conversation that you had with 4 Michael Cohen on April 4th of 2018.

5 Do you remember that? 6 A Yes.

9 A I believe so.

10 Q And was Michael Avenatti suing you and Michael Cohen 11 at the time --
12 A Yes. 13 Q -- that you had this conversation with Michael Cohen? 14 A Yes.

15 Q Would you like me to put or hand you copies of some of 16 the transcript segments that Mr. Bove showed you?

17 A Yes, please.

18 Q I'm going to hand you Defendant's F17-CT and 19 Defendant's F17-ET.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: AT. 21 MR. STEINGLASS: Dash ET.

22 (Whereupon, the documents are shown to the 23 defense and then shown to the witness.) 24 THE WITNESS: Thanks.

25 Q You have them?

7 Q And, at the time, as of April 4th of 2018, had Stormy 8 Daniels hired Michael Avenatti?

1971 1 A Yes.

2 Q Okay. 3 So, let's start with F17-CT. 4 Mr. Bove asked you if you said to Michael Cohen: "And now 5 that Avenatti has really driven a wedge, a serious wedge in 6 between Stormy and Gina, Avenatti is leaning on Gina and 7 saying, you know, basically we're lying, we know we're full of 8 shit in the media, we know that she was never threatened in Las 9 Vegas, we know all these things."
10 What did you mean when you said that? 11 A I meant that, uh, that Avenatti was trying to, uh, 12 persuade Gina's testimony. 13 Q So, were you in any way acknowledging that you were 14 lying?

15 A No. 16 Q Were you in any way acknowledging that Stormy Daniels 17 was never threatened in Las Vegas?

18 A No. 19 Q Is it your belief that -- or is it your meaning that 20 when you said that, you were talking about the things that 21 Avenatti was going to allege or was alleging?

22 A That's correct. 23 Q Similarly, Mr. Bove showed you, or read you, or played 24 for you, or all of the above, a portion of the same call and 25 gave you the transcript F17-ET.

1972 1 Can you take a look at that one, please?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And he asked you if you said: "I wouldn't be the least 4 bit surprised if he comes out and says" -- let me just stop 5 myself for one second to ask, who is "he" in that? 6 A Anthony Kotsev.

7 Q Okay.
17 A Yes.

18 Q Are you at all saying that Stormy Daniels said those 19 things?

20 A It was my understanding at the time that -- that this 21 was April 4th, and that Anthony Kotsev was about to give a 22 media interview, in sum and substance, in alignment with this 23 text. 24 Q Just to be very clear, you were not telling Michael 25 Cohen that Stormy Daniels was talking about the election and 8 "I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out and says: You know 9 what, Stormy Daniels, she wanted this money more than you could 10 ever imagine. I remember hearing her on the phone saying, you, 11 fucking Keith Davidson, you better settle this goddamn story 12 because if he loses this election, and he's going to lose, if 13 he loses this election, then we lose all fucking leverage and 14 this case is worth zero."
15 Mr. Bove asked you if you were discussing the Stormy 16 Daniels case when you said these things to Michael Cohen?

1973 1 how she's gonna lose her leverage after the election; it was 2 your understanding that those were things that Anthony Kotsev 3 was going to say? 4 A Correct.

5 Q You testified on direct examination that you had an 6 opportunity to review documents and exhibits that were 7 contained on a thumb drive. 8 Do you remember that? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Did you have a chance to listen to another recorded 11 conversation from October 16, 2017 between yourself and Michael 12 Cohen that has been marked for identification as People's 13 Exhibit 265? 14 A Yes.

15 Q Do you know who made that recording? 16 A Michael Cohen surreptitiously made the recording.

17 Q When you say "surreptitiously", did that mean you did 18 not know you were being recorded? 19 A I did not know I was being recorded.

20 Q Does that fairly and accurately depict a conversation 21 that you had with Michael Cohen on October 16, 2017?

22 A Yes. 23 MR. STEINGLASS: I offer it into evidence. 24 MR. BOVE: No objection.

25 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

1974 1 (Whereupon, the exhibit is received in evidence.)
4 Exhibit 267?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Is that a transcript of the recorded phone 7 conversation that we just admitted as People's Exhibit 265? 9 Q Have you compared the transcript to the recording 10 itself? 11 A I have.

12 Q Is it accurate? 13 A Yes. 14 MR. STEINGLASS: I offer that into evidence.

15 MR. BOVE: Can I have one moment to confer with 16 Mr. Steinglass?

17 THE COURT: Yes.

18 (Whereupon, Counsel confer.) 19 MR. BOVE: No objection.

20 Thank you, Judge. 21 THE COURT: People's 267 is accepted into 22 evidence. 23 (Whereupon, the exhibit is received in evidence.) 24 MR. STEINGLASS: What I would like to do, please, 25 is display People's 267, Pages 10 to 11, while I'm playing 8 A Yes. 2 Q Similarly, did you also have the opportunity to review 3 what has been marked for identification as People's 1 a portion of 265, from 11 minutes and 13 seconds into the 2 call through 13 minutes and 33 seconds into the call. 3 And we can display this to everyone, please. 4 (Whereupon, the audio exhibit is played in open 5 court and the exhibit is shown on the screens.) 6 Q So, the portions of that tape that are attributed to 7 "Keith", is that your voice? 8 A Yes.

22 A I attributed that to be a quote from Mr. Trump. 23 Q About what? "Did" what? 24 A The Stormy Daniels settlement.

25 MR. STEINGLASS: One minute, please.

9 Q And the portions of the tape that are attributed to 10 "Michael", is that Michael Cohen's voice? 11 A Yes.

12 Q I want to blow up a particular paragraph here at the 13 top of Page 11. 14 Do you see the paragraph we're blowing up?

15 A Yes. 16 Q When Mr. Cohen said to you, "I can't even tell you how 17 many times he said to me," who did you understand "he" to be a 18 reference to? 19 A Mr. Trump.

20 Q And what did you understand, "I hate the fact that we 21 did it," attributed to Mr. Trump, to be a reference to?

1975 1976 1 (Whereupon, the People confer.)
2 MR. STEINGLASS: No further questions. 3 THE COURT: Thank you. 4 Mr. Bove, anything else?

5 MR. BOVE: Yes, please. 6 RECROSS EXAMINATION
7 BY MR. BOVE: 8 Q Mr. Davidson, you don't know the day of that 9 recording; do you?

15 A I don't understand your question. 16 Q You have no frame of reference for when that was said 17 in the context of all the other events that you testified about 18 today; right? 19 A No, I have a pretty good understanding of the context.

20 Q My question is not the date, sir. 21 You don't know when the conversation occurred, as you sit 22 here; do you? 23 A Not offhand. 24 Q And you were asked questions by Mr. Steinglass about 25 the recordings that you and I discussed; right?

10 Q Where do you work? 11 A I work for the New York County District Attorney's 12 Office.

14 Office? 13 Q How long have you worked in the District Attorney's 15 A It will be ten years in July. 16 Q Where do you work in the DA's Office?

17 A HTAU. High Technology Analysis Unit.

18 Q What does HTAU do? 19 A Process all types of digital evidence that comes 20 through our Lab to this Office. We take extractions from this 21 type of evidence and produce reports for them.

22 Q How long have you worked at HTAU?

23 A It will be ten years in July. 24 Q Can you tell us a little bit about your educational 25 background?

9 BY MR. CONROY: 8 DIRECT EXAMINATION
1981 1 A I have a degree in psychology.

2 I've been in this field a number of -- 20 years. I have a 3 number of industry standard certifications, as well. 4 Q Can you tell us about some of your certifications?

5 A Certainly. One is a CCME, a Cellebrite Certified 6 Mobile Examiner. Another one would be a Certified Computer 7 Examiner.

20 Q When were you in Iraq? 21 A From April -- end of April '09 to when we closed, in 22 November of 2011. 23 Q And what were you doing over there? 24 A Same type of work as here.

25 Q What's your current role in HTAU?

8 Q Where did you receive that training? 9 A That training has been over the years that I've been 10 accompanied with this type of job. It comes from the company 11 itself, for Cellebrite. The other certification happens to be 12 an internal body of trainees and trainers. 13 Q Can you tell us about your experience in the field and 14 your work history?

15 A Certainly. So, before the ten years here, I worked two 16 years for Guidance Software. It was a company that created 17 EnCase. It's software that does forensics.

18 Two years prior to that, I was embedded in the military in 19 Iraq, doing the same type of work here.

1982 1 A I'm a Supervising Computer Forensic Analyst.

2 Q Can you just give a brief description of what computer 3 and phone forensics means? 4 A It means that when we get a device that is a computer 5 or phone, we then process that device. At that moment, we take 6 a digital copy of the entire evidence, preserve it, and then 7 work with that copy to perform an analysis of those devices. 8 Q Can you describe your day-to-day responsibilities as a 9 supervising analyst in HTAU?

10 A Besides the daily supervision of the Lab, keeping up 11 with technology, software, hardware. I am also an analyst, so 12 any type of cases that come my way, I may also perform the 13 extractions and produce reports for them. 14 Q What kinds of devices do you analyze on a day-to-day 15 basis? 16 A Cell phones, primarily. It could be computers, as 17 well, thumb drives, iCloud accounts. Actually, anything that 18 would contain digital media. 19 Q In the time you've been in HTAU, about how many 20 devices have you analyzed? 21 A Here, as of today, 3,392.

22 Q Approximately? 23 A Approximately. 24 Q How many of those are phones?

25 A Anywhere from 80 to 90 percent are phones.

1 Q So, thousands of phones?
1983

2 A Yes.
3 Q Does HTAU have a standard intake procedure for when 4 the Unit receives digital evidence?

5 A We do. 6 Q Can you describe that intake procedure that HTAU uses?

7 A So, once an intake email is set up from the attorneys 8 to our Department, typically, devices will come in either 9 pursuant to a Search Warrant or a Consent Form. Those devices 10 then come to our office. We will examine them, take pictures of 11 them, label them, keep records of those licenses, and then 12 produce Chain of Custody Forms, and then begin the extractions 13 and analysis. 14 Q Would it be routine to -- for the person doing intake 15 to know what authority HTAU has to do the search of the device? 16 A We don't do any devices without such.

17 Q That's where you mentioned Search Warrant or Consent?

18 A That is correct. 19 Q Briefly, what is a Search Warrant?

20 A A Search Warrant is authority from a judge that signs, 21 that allows us to examine the devices obtained for our Search 22 Warrant. 23 Q What is Consent? 24 A Consent, just simply, the owner of the device consents 25 to the examination of the device.

1984 1 Q Once the intake has been done, what happens to the 2 device? 3 A Once the intake is done, it is assigned an analyst. In 4 this case, it would have been me. We then look at the Search 5 Warrant or Consent Form, make sure all the numbers are correct, 6 and then proceed with the extraction of devices.

7 Q Would it be fair to say that the person who does the 8 intake is not always the person that does the analysis of a 9 particular device?

10 A Not always, that's correct. 11 Q Have you, yourself, extracted data from and performed 12 analysis on smartphones, including Apple iPhones? 13 A Yes, I have. 14 Q Can you tell us a little bit more about the extraction 15 process, specifically for a cell phone? 16 A Depending upon whether it's an Android or an Apple 17 iPhone, we then take it into a particular room. If we have a 18 PIN code to it, then we'll proceed with the extraction of the 19 device.

20 Q When you say, "If we have a PIN code," what do you 21 mean?

22 A In Consents, we are usually provided the PIN code. 23 Q You mean the password? 24 A That is correct.

25 Q What types of tools or programs do you use to extract 1985 1 data from smartphones or cell phones?

2 A As mentioned before, Cellebrite is one of them. 3 Graykey is another one. 4 Q What do those tools do when they're extracting 5 information from the phone? What does it extract? 6 A It extracts the entire content of the device and puts 7 it in a format that's readable by the format itself. 8 Q When you say "content of the device", is that data? 9 A That is all the data on those devices.

10 Q How do you read that data once its been extracted? 11 A We use, again, the software called Cellebrite to then 12 take the contents of those devices and put it into a meaningful 13 format.

16 A Anything that you would normally see on the device, 19 Q In that process, is any of the data on the phone 20 changed in any way? 21 A We're dealing with a live phone, so perhaps some 22 things in the background like software. But, for all intents 23 and purposes, things do not change. 24 Q Can -- withdrawn.

25 What kinds of data, specifically, can be extracted from a 14 Q Once it's in that format, what kinds of things can you 15 look at from the extraction?

17 your call history, your contacts, your text messages, videos, 18 pictures and such.

1 smartphone?

2 A Um, text messages, all types of software, call 3 history, log files, anything that is normally on a phone. 4 Q Can you get contact lists? 5 A You can. 6 Q Pictures?

7 A Pictures.

9 A Calendar entries.

10 Q Audio recordings? 11 A Audios.

12 Q Can you pull the phone number associated with the 13 smartphone? 14 A Absolutely. 15 Q The user name? 16 A The user name.

17 Q Can you get emails?

18 A You can. 19 Q And can you get downloaded apps? 20 A Yes, you may. 21 Q Can you also get something called metadata?

22 A You can.

23 Q Can you tell us a little about what metadata is? 24 A Simply, metadata is data about data. 25 To give an analogy, let's say you look at a book. Before 1986 8 Q Calendar entries?

1987 1 you open it up, you may see the title of it, maybe the author, 2 but you don't know who published it, who wrote it and when it 3 was done. You would simply open up the book cover, and that's 4 the information that would be considered metadata.

5 Q How is that metadata on the phone created? 6 A It's created by the year and/or the operating system 7 itself and applications. 8 Q And does that depend on what kind of metadata it is? 9 A It just depends on the artifact.

10 Q As part of your work in HTAU, were you assigned to an 11 investigation involving Donald Trump?

12 A I was. 13 Q Were you assigned to two devices to analyze as part of 14 that investigation?

15 A Yes, I was. 16 Q What kinds of devices?

17 A There are two iPhones. The first one is an iPhone 6s, 18 and the second one is an iPhone 7. 19 Q Did you understand the authority that HTAU had to be 20 in possession and look at those two phones? 21 A As mentioned before, it was a Consent.

22 Q And whose Consent, if you know? 23 A The Consent was Michael Cohen. 24 Q And do you know whose phones those were?

25 A They were Michael Cohen's.

1988 1 Q Did one of the phones that you received have a gold 2 case? 3 A It did. 4 Q Was that the 6s?

5 A That was. 6 Q Did you assign an identifier to that phone to use 8 A I did. 9 Q What was the identifier?

10 A CP-0001. 11 "CP" stands for cell phone.

12 Q Is that sort of a standard practice in a particular 14 A That's correct.

15 Q Is that okay if I call that "CP1" going forward? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Do you recall the last four digits of the phone number 18 for that phone? 19 A 0114.

20 Q Did you note the serial number of that phone? 21 A I did.

22 I don't recall it. 23 Q Is there something that could refresh your 24 recollection?

25 A Notes would, yes.

13 case, you would name any phone CP-001 through any phones?

7 within HTAU?

1989 1 MR. CONROY: Just for the parties and the Court 2 and the witness, could we display those notes? 3 THE COURT: Is there an identification of it? 4 Mark it for identification.

5 MR. CONROY: We could mark that as People's -- 6 just one moment, Judge.

7 (Whereupon, the People confer.) 8 MR. CONROY: If we could mark that as People's 9 511-A.

10 THE COURT: Thank you. 11 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' 12 screen and on the parties' screens.) 13 Q Mr. Daus, take a look at that. 14 Does that refresh your memory what the serial number for 15 the phone is? 16 A Yes, it does.

17 Q Tell us what it was.

18 A Delta, November, Papa, Quebec, Charlie, Zero, Hotel, 19 One, Golf, Ralph, Yellow, and Three.

20 Q And, if I may, to put that into the regular alphabet, 21 is that DNPQC0H1GRY3?

22 A That is correct. 23 Q Did the other phone that you received have a black 24 case?

25 A It did.

1990 1 Q Was that the iPhone 7?

2 A It was. 3 Q Was an identifier assigned to this phone? 4 A It was.

5 Q What was that? 6 A CP-0002.

7 Q Is that okay if I refer to that as "CP2" going 10 Q Do you remember the last four digits of the phone 11 number for that phone?

12 A 6866. 13 Q Again, do you remember the serial number for that 14 phone?

15 A I do not. 16 MR. CONROY: If we could pull up what I would deem 17 marked People's 15 -- People's 511-B, just for the parties 18 and the witness.

20 screen and on the parties' screens.) 21 Q Take a look at that, and tell us if it refreshes your 22 recollection. 23 A It does. 24 Q What was the serial number?

25 A F18T2PHHG7K.

19 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' 8 forward? 9 A Yes.

1991 1 Q Thank you.

2 MR. CONROY: You can take that down. 8 A Yes, they did. 9 Q Did you do the intake yourself?

10 A I did not. 11 Q Once you were assigned the phones, what did you do 12 with them? 13 A Once I received the phones, I kind of mentioned 14 before, I take them to what's called our F Room, our Faraday 15 Room. F-A-R-A-D-A-Y. It's a room that separates the room from 16 outside sources so there's no interference.

17 We'll then plug that into a device, hardware device, and 18 then proceed, after given the passcode, to extract the data 19 from the device.

20 Q Once you did all of that, did you end up with a full 21 forensic extraction on each of the data on CP1 and CP2?

22 A It was a full extraction. 23 Q We talked a little about this. In layman's terms, 24 could you explain for the members of the jury what "full 25 forensic extraction" means?

6 Q Did each of these two devices go through the intake 7 process, as you just described for us? 3 Q When you received the phones to forensically examine, 4 do you recall if CP1 and CP2 were powered on or powered off?

5 A They were off.

1992 1 A It's just an extraction from the beginning of the 2 storage device to the end of it, meaning it captures all the 3 data.

13 A Yes, it is. 14 Q How do you know that?

15 A I dated it and initialed it after examining it. 16 Q Are all of the exhibits on the thumb drive, except for 17 People's 248, which we'll come back to, an exact copy of 18 portions of data forensically extracted from either CP1 or CP2? 19 A Yes, they are.

22 are already in evidence. 23 One moment.

25 MR. CONROY: I'm sorry. It's 255 and 265, which 11 A I did.

12 Q Is that the same thumb drive that you reviewed?

20 MR. CONROY: This thumb drive, for the record, I 21 will note, contains People's 255 and People's 266, which 24 (Whereupon, the People confer.)
4 MR. CONROY: If I could hand the witness a thumb 5 drive that contains People's Exhibits 246 to 266. 6 (Whereupon, the thumb drive is given to the 7 witness.) 8 Q Mr. Daus, before testifying here today, did you have a 9 chance to review each of these exhibits that are marked as 10 People's 246 to 266 on the thumb drive?

1993 1 are both already in evidence.

2 Q Mr. Daus, when you reviewed those exhibits, did you 3 see redactions in many of the exhibits? 4 A Yes, I did.

5 Q Did you, as you were looking at the exhibit on the 6 thumb drive, look at both an unredacted and redacted copy of 7 each of the exhibits? 8 A Yes, I did. 9 Q Where there were redactions, were the exhibits, but 10 for the redactions, the same as the corresponding exhibit 11 without redactions?

12 A Yes, they were. 13 Q What kinds of information was redacted on the exhibits 14 that you were looking at with redactions?

15 A The parties' names. 16 Q Was it, primarily, personal identifying information, 17 names, email addresses, phone numbers, that kind of thing?

18 A Yes, it was. 19 Q Did you review each of these exhibits, except for 20 Exhibit 248, against the data that you forensically extracted 21 from either CP1 or CP2, depending which it came from, to make 22 sure that each of the exhibits contained exact copies of the 23 portions of data that you extracted from each of the phones? 24 A Yes, I did.

25 Q Other than People's 248, do People's Exhibits 246 to 1994 1 266 contain exact copies of data extracted from CP1 or CP2?

2 A Yes, they do. 3 MR. CONROY: Judge, at this time I'd like to 4 offer as -- into evidence People's 246, 247, 249 to 254, 5 256 to 264, and 266.

20 A Yes, they are.

23 MR. CONROY: You can pull this up for everybody. 24 You can pull up People's 259.

25 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
6 THE COURT: Any objections?

7 MR. BOVE: No, your Honor. 8 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 9 (Whereupon, the aforementioned exhibits are 10 received in evidence.) 11 Q Now, I want to, first, talk about the group exhibits, 12 numbers 249 to 251, 255, which was already in evidence, 257 to 13 260, and 262. 14 Are each of those Cellebrite reports created from the 15 extraction that you did on CP1? 16 A Yes, they are.

17 Q And are they all text messages with Michael Cohen as 18 one of the parties? And with respect to each of the exhibits, 19 are different parties corresponding with Michael Cohen?

21 Q I would like to pull up an example just to go through 22 what a report looks like.

1995 1 Q If you look at those, who are those texts between?

2 A The parties would be the owner of the phone, Michael 3 Cohen, and Hope Hicks. 4 Q And can you tell us the last four digits of Hope 5 Hicks' phone number? 6 A 0226.

9 First of all, is this format what you would see in one of 10 the Cellebrite Reports that you were talking about earlier? 11 A Yes, it is.

12 Q So, this was data extracted from the phone and then 13 put into a Cellebrite Report? 14 A That's correct.

15 Q Can you tell us about each of the columns, the header 16 columns on this exhibit?

17 A Certainly.

18 The first one is self-explanatory, the date. Your next 19 column is the time. Then the parties. The description is the 20 content of the message. And the source is just what particular 21 artifact it came from, being the native messaging app.

22 Q Okay. 23 That's sort of where the data lived on the phone? 24 A Yes.

25 Q When you say "description", that's the body of the 7 Q Now, could you just tell us a little bit about each of 8 the columns that's blown up there?

1996 1 text?

2 A That's correct. 3 Q I want to talk a little bit about the time here. 4 In your work, have you become familiar with different time 5 zones and how timestamps work on different phones and other 6 devices?

7 A Yes, I have. 8 Q Are you familiar with UTC? 9 A Yes.

10 Q What is UTC? 11 A Universal Time Coordinated. Basically stands for the 12 old way of weighing time. GMT, Greenwich Mean Time. 13 We're on an Earth with 24 Time Zones, so one place starts 14 with zero. There are a few zones that go around. New York here, 15 we're either two different times, depending upon when it 16 changes twice a year. So, it would be UTC minus 4 or UTC minus 17 5.

18 Q Meaning, if the time up there says 7:09:12 P.M. UTC 19 minus 4, what Time Zone is that time in?

20 A So, it's already converted to Eastern Standard Time, 21 so it's 7:09 PM.

22 Q And you mentioned the time change either being UTC 23 minus 4 or UTC minus 5. 24 Does that relate to Daylight Saving Time?

25 A Yes, it does.

1997 1 MR. CONROY: If we could now pull up People's 263 2 in evidence. 3 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 4 Q Is this a report of contacts from CP1?

5 A Yes, it is. 6 Q How many contacts were in -- on CP1?

7 A 39,745. 8 Q Is that unusual? 9 A That is unusual.

10 Q In what way? 11 A I've not seen contacts -- that many being on a phone.

12 Q What would be a more -- what would be an average 13 number of contacts that you would see when you do this kind of 14 examination of a phone?

15 A Maybe hundreds. 16 Q Hundreds.

17 Maybe thousands?

18 A Thousands. A thousand, at the most. 19 MR. CONROY: Can we pull up a few examples of the 20 contacts from the phone? 21 First, could we pull up -- this is three pages of 22 contacts that were on CP1 for David Pecker. 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 Q Is that what that is?

25 A Yes.

1998 1 Q Could we next pull up -- is this two pages of contacts 2 for Hope Hicks? 3 MR. CONROY: The next one. 4 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
5 A Yes, it is. 6 Q Could we also look -- is this the next 12 pages of 7 contacts for Allen Weisselberg? 8 A Yes, it is. 9 Q And, finally, could we pull up -- is this three pages 11 A Yes, it is.

12 Q New, if you recall, was this all the pages of accounts 13 for Donald Trump? 14 A No.

15 Q Do you remember how many pages of contacts for Donald 16 Trump were on CP1?

17 A I think there were ten.

18 Q We're not gonna pull up additional pages, but did the 19 contacts on CP1 also include contacts for Dylan Howard?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Keith Davidson?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Keith Schiller? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Melania Trump?

10 of contacts for Donald Trump?

1 A Yes.

2 Q Rhona Graff? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Jay Sekulow?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Larry Rosen?

7 A Yes.

8 Q Daniel Rotstein? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And Gary Farro? 11 A Yes.

12 MR. CONROY: Could we now quickly pull up what's 13 in evidence as People's 264? 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
15 Q Is this the contacts from CP2?

19 Q Is that more what you're used to seeing?

20 A Yes. 21 MR. CONROY: If we could next pull up People's 22 256. 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 Q Is this an example of emails that were pulled off of 25 CP1?

1999 16 A It is.

17 Q How many contacts were on this phone?

18 A 385.

2000 1 A They are.

2 Q I, again, just want to kind of walk through for the 3 jury the different columns that we see in -- is it okay if I 4 call this a Cellebrite Report?

5 A Yes, you can. 6 Q Can you walk us through the headers of the columns and 7 explain a little bit about what the information is in each 8 column? 9 A Certainly.

10 There's the date, the time, which is also in -- posted by 11 the date, the party, between the two parties sending and 12 receiving emails, the description, and the source, just saying 13 that it's from emails. 14 Q Who are the parties on this?

15 A From Patty to Michael Cohen. 16 Q What's Patty's email, the end of her email address?

17 A That's @Delaneycorporate.com.

18 Q Thanks. 19 MR. CONROY: If we could next pull up what's in 20 evidence as People's 253. 21 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screen.)
22 Q Taking a look at People's 253, is this a photograph 23 that you pulled up from CP1? 24 A It is.

25 Q Do you know who that is in that photograph?

2001 1 A I do.

2 Q Who is that? 3 A That's Michael Cohen. 4 Q Have you ever met Michael Cohen?

5 A I haven't. 6 Q Sorry?

7 A I have not. 8 Sorry. 9 Q How do you know that that's him?

10 A I watch a lot of news. 11 Q And do you know -- can you tell from looking at that, 13 A Looks like the White House. 14 MR. CONROY: If we could now pull up what's in 15 evidence as People's 252. 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
17 MR. CONROY: And if you could blow that up a 18 little bit. 19 Thank you.

20 Q Mr. Daus, what is this? 21 A This is, as mentioned before, the metadata about that 22 picture. 23 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 24 relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the 25 transcript continues on the following page.)
12 where that photograph was taken?

1 (The following proceedings are continued from the 2002 2 previous page.) 3 ******* 4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
5 BY MR. CONROY: 6 Q And can you tell us, what does that metadata tell us 8 If you could sort of explain that as you walk through the 9 columns?

10 A All right. So you have modified time, created time, 11 access time.

12 They are all on February 8th of 2017 at approximately 13 5:39 p.m. 14 Q Okay. And what does each of those things mean? 17 Q Okay. And does that mean that's when that photo was 18 created? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Okay. 21 MR. CONROY: If we could now pull up what's in 22 evidence as People's 254. 23 And if you could blow that up a little bit. 24 (Displayed.)
25 Q Is this a copy of a calendar invite?

7 about that picture?

15 A It just means that those are the dates, the times that 16 existed on that phone.

2003 1 A Yes, it is.

2 Q Again, a Cellebrite report? 3 A That's correct. 4 Q So this was extracted, this is part of your forensic 5 extraction of the phone? 6 A Yes, it is. 7 Q What -- can you tell us again the date, and sort of 8 walk us through the columns? 9 A As mentioned before, so date, time, and description, 10 February 8th, 2017, at 4:30 p.m., of a calendar event. 11 The description is called "Meeting with POTUS." 12 Q And, again, up there, can you tell us about the time 13 zone, you see UTC minus five. Can you tell us what time zone 14 this is in? 15 A Eastern Standard Time. This is before the time changes 17 This is February, so that's why it's minus five.

18 MR. CONROY: Could we now look at People's 261 in 19 evidence. 20 (Displayed.) 21 Q What is this report? 22 A It's another report of a call log from the WhatsApp 23 application that existed on the device. 24 Q What is a call log? 25 A A call log is just a log that identifies when calls 16 in March.

2004 1 were made.

2 Q And you said it was from an app called "WhatsApp?" 3 A That's correct. 4 Q What is WhatsApp? 5 A WhatsApp is an app, an encrypted app that users use to 6 communicate with each other. 7 Q And you said -- what is an encrypted app? 8 A It just means that the conversation between you and the 11 Q WhatsApp is an example of that type of an app? 13 Q Did you find other encrypted apps on either CP1 and/or 14 CP2? 16 Q Which ones did you find, if you remember? 17 A Telegram and Signal.

18 Q Now, if you recall, was People's 265, which is in 19 evidence and was already in evidence, an audio recording that 20 you extracted from CP2? 21 A Yes, it was. 22 MR. CONROY: Could we pull up what's in evidence as 23 People's 266. 24 And if you could blow that up a little bit. 25 (Displayed.)
9 next party is encrypted.

10 It can't be intercepted and/or vetted. 12 A It's an example. 15 A I did.

2005 1 Q What is People's 266?

2 A This is the information about the recording. 3 Q Is this the metadata for that recording? 4 A It is. 5 Q And what's the title of that recording? 6 A The title was labeled "Keith Davidson, October 16th, 7 2017." 8 Q And was that recording made, if you know, on 9 October 16th, 2017?

10 A It was. 11 Q And how do you know that? 12 A Based upon the application called "Voice Memos," how it 13 names the file itself and keeps track of the timestamp, that is 14 embedded within the file. 15 Q And do we see that same date in some of the other 16 columns? 17 A Yes, we do.

18 Q Including in the timestamp date column? 19 A That is correct. 20 Q And also the timestamp time column? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And, again, that's all metadata forensically extracted 24 A That is correct. 25 Q Now, can we look at People's 247. 23 from CP2?

2006 2 ********** 3 MR. CONROY: And if we could blow that up a little 4 bit.

5 (Displayed.) 6 Q Is this the metadata for this audio recording?

7 A It is.

11 A The title is entitled "New Recording 3," which 12 indicates that there are two previous recordings on the Voice 13 Memo app on the iPhone. 14 It's just an audio recording; it's on the app, which is the 15 audio recording software. 16 It gives the date and timestamp of September 6th, 2016 at 17 approximately 10:56:42 a.m. in the morning, Eastern Standard 18 Time, with a duration of two minutes and 51 seconds. 19 The Link is just the name of the file again.

20 And the end is just the source. 21 Every file has a source path where it exists on the device.

22 Q Now, People's 246 is an audio file. It's not a 23 recording that you were able to forensically extract from CP1; 24 right?

25 A That is correct.

8 Q And can you walk us through the columns here and walk 9 us through the title and what kind of file this is and the date 10 and time it's created?

2007

1 Q Did you have a chance to listen to People's 246?

2 A I did.
3 MR. CONROY: And if we could, just for the parties 4 and the Judge, take a look at what's marked or what's in 5 evidence as People's 248.

7 parties.)
6 (Displayed on the screen for the aforementioned 8 ******* 9 MR. CONROY: I'm sorry. What had been marked for 10 identification as People's 248. 11 Q Mr. Daus, do you recognize what that is?

12 A I do. 13 Q What is that? 14 A That's a transcript of that aforementioned audio.

15 Q Is it a transcript of approximately 46 seconds of the 16 audio file that is People's Exhibit 246?

17 A Yes, it is.

18 Q Is that recording longer than 46 seconds? 19 A It is.

20 Q So this is a transcript just of the last 46 seconds of 21 that recording?

22 A That's correct. 23 Q Did you have an opportunity to compare that transcript 24 to the last 46 seconds of that recording as you were listening 25 to it?

2008 1 A I have.

2 Q Is the transcript a fair and accurate rendering of the 3 words that you hear, what you listened to, the last 46 seconds 4 in People's 246? 5 A To the best of my ability. 6 MR. CONROY: At this point I would offer People's 7 248 into evidence. 8 THE COURT: Any objections? 9 MR. BOVE: No, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 11 (So marked in evidence.) 12 ********* 13 MR. CONROY: If we could now click People's 248 or, 14 actually, can you pull that down for a minute. 15 And if we could play People's 246 and then stop it 16 when we get to 46 seconds from the end, and then I will ask 17 to put the transcript up on the screens.

18 (Audio playing.) 19 MR. CONROY: Can we pull up the transcript. 20 (Displayed.) 21 MR. CONROY: And if we can play the last 22 46 seconds. 23 (Audio playing.) 24 Q And just so the record is clear, the metadata that we 25 just looked at, that was People's 247, is the date and time that 2009 1 that recording was created; is that right?

2 A It is. 3 MR. CONROY: One moment. 4 (Pause.) 5 MR. CONROY: Thank you, Judge. 6 Nothing further. 7 THE COURT: Any cross? 8 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge, thank you. 9 May I inquire?

10 THE COURT: Yes. 11 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. 12 ******* 13 CROSS-EXAMINATION 14 BY MR. BOVE: 15 Q Is it Mr. Daus? 17 A That's correct.

18 Q My name is Emil Bove. I represent President Trump. 19 It sounded like, to me, like you started your career in 20 forensics in Iraq? 21 A I didn't start it in Iraq, but before that actually. 22 Q You did some work over there. And I think you said 23 that that work is similar to what you are doing for the District 24 Attorney's office? 25 A That's correct.

16 Am I saying that right?

2010

1 Q But there are some differences; right?
2 A Yeah. 3 Q And, to me, one of the differences breaks down to the 4 difference between Intel collection and the presentation of 5 evidence in criminal cases; correct? 6 A Sure.

7 Q Do you know what I mean by "Intel collection?" 8 A A collection of things that are important for national 9 security.

10 Q Right. 11 And in Iraq you were doing that, essentially, on a 12 battlefield, more or less; right? 13 A In a lab, yes. 14 Q And it was important to get information to parties who 15 could use it as quickly as possible; right? 16 A Absolutely.

17 Q That is, in that setting, in the Intel setting, that's 18 probably the top priority? 19 A I would say.

20 Q And it's not necessarily a top priority in connection 21 with a criminal investigation; right?

22 A I do the same thing on every case. 23 Q Well, the integrity of the data matters more in a 24 criminal case than on a battlefield; doesn't it?

25 A I would say so, sure.

2011

1 Q Because different rights are at stake?

2 A Certainly.
3 Q And so, things that you might be able to do more 4 quickly outside the United States requires more caution in the 5 United States; right? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And that's the distinction that I'm trying to touch on. 8 There are some procedures that you follow here in the US 9 that are just different than what you were doing outside the 10 US? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q And you work in a Department now that -- how do you say 13 the acronym, HTAU? 14 A HTAU. 15 Q Which is basically a multimillion dollar cyber lab; 16 right? 17 A Yes.

18 Q Funded in part by the District Attorney's Office and 19 some others? 20 A That is correct. 21 Q And it sounded to me like you are basically, when you 22 are doing these phone reviews, you are operating in a secure 23 environment? 24 A Yes, sir. 25 Q I have seen pictures. It looks like a vault; right?

2012 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q There are some parts of this that are a SCIF? 3 A Sure. There are no signals coming out, so it would be 4 a SCIF. 5 Q And I'm guessing no windows and it has heavy doors; 6 right? 7 A Yes, that's correct. 8 Q And that is to prevent the devices that you are 9 working on from being manipulated while you are working on it; 10 correct? 11 A Yes. That's absolutely correct. 12 Q And the Director of HTAU is Steve Moran; right? 13 A He is. 14 Q And I think I've seen him say publicly that there is a 15 real concern that investigative targets can manipulate data and 16 their devices remotely? 17 A Yes.

18 MR. CONROY: Objection. 19 THE COURT: Overruled. 20 You can answer. 21 A Yes. 22 Q You agree with Mr. Moran; right? 23 A I do. 24 Q And so, here in New York, one of the top priorities for 25 the analysis and the forensics that you are conducting is 2013 1 maintaining the integrity of the data?

2 A Absolutely. 3 Q And it's important to maintain that integrity, because 4 it ultimately goes to the reliability and the evidence that you 5 present in a criminal trial setting like this; right? 6 A Yes. 7 Q That goes to how much weight the jury should put on 8 it? 9 A That's correct.

10 Q Evidence that has been subject to a risk of 11 manipulation is less reliable; isn't it? 12 A Certainly. 13 Q That's a basic principle of the forensic certifications 14 that you described; right? 15 A That is correct. 16 Q And so, in your field, there are processes and 17 procedures that are designed to maintain the integrity of the 18 data? 19 A Yes, there are. 20 Q So let's talk a little bit more about the different 21 steps in the process. 22 Let's start with device collection, which I think is the 23 first step; right? 24 A That is correct. 25 Q It sometimes is called the "acquisition phase?"
1 A That's correct.

2014 2 Q Meaning, how does law enforcement get the device that 3 you ultimately search; right? 4 A That's correct.

5 Q And that could happen in a lot of ways; right? 6 A Yes.

10 Q Execute a search warrant, seize a device, and bring it 11 to you; right?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Issue a subpoena and collect a device and bring it to 14 you; right?

15 A That's correct. 16 Q Or in this case, a device was delivered to you with an 17 authorization from Michael Cohen; right?

18 That's how it was acquired, the two devices were acquired? 19 A Yes, it was.

20 Q And if you got to pick from the kinds of just pure 21 forensics, the best case scenario would be that once acquired, 22 the device goes immediately in the vault; right? 23 A That's correct. 24 Q It is immediately secured, to be kept away from radio 25 waves; right?

7 Q Law enforcement can collect a device at a crime scene; 8 right? 9 A That's correct.

2015 1 A Yes.

2 Q And that -- I don't want to sound crazy, but that's 3 radio waves that we are talking about, the internet we're 4 talking about, phone signals; right? 5 A Phone signals, yeah. 6 Q So if you got to pick the top priority, it would be 7 let's get the phone or phones in the vault; right?

8 A Yes. 9 Q That can't always happen; right?

10 A It can't. 11 Q It can be your priority, but there are other people 12 involved in the investigation; right?

16 Q And so sometimes there is a lag time?

17 A There is.

18 Q Some delays in getting the device in the vault? 19 A Yes. 20 Q Some delays in getting the device protected from 21 manipulation?

22 A That's correct.

23 Q There are interim measures in your field for sort of 24 protecting the device while it's in that transit process; 25 right? 13 A That's correct. 14 Q They have other priorities; correct? 15 A That is absolutely correct.

1 A That's correct.

2016 2 Q I think you mentioned -- did you mention a Faraday 3 room? 4 A Faraday room, yes. 5 Q But there's also a Faraday bag? 6 A There is. 7 Q So sometimes you can get the device, throw it in the 8 bag, and it's protected from the radio signals; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q You can do it immediately? 11 A You can do it immediately. 12 Q And that is the soundest way to do a device 14 A The soundest way. 15 Q One of the considerations here in the acquisition phase 16 is chain of custody; right?

18 Q And you know what that means? 19 A Yep. 20 Q Chain of custody is the process by which who handles 21 the device is tracked; right? 23 Q Who acquired it; right? 24 A Yes. 25 Q Who brought it --
13 acquisition; correct? 17 A Yes.

22 A That's correct.

2017 1 A Who brought it.

2 Q -- back to your office; right? 3 A That is correct. 4 Q Who participated in the intake process; right? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And now, there are two sides of that. Somebody brings 7 the device and somebody accepts it, right, and so those are 8 links in the chain? 9 A Links in the chain.

10 Q The more secure the chain of custody, the more reliable 12 A One could ascertain. 13 Q But you believe that? I mean, you have been practicing 14 this for a long time; right? 15 A Certainly. 16 Q And you believe that to be true; don't you? 17 A Certainly.

18 Q That is correct? 19 A That is correct. 20 Q And a break in the chain of custody, it presents a 21 risk; right? 22 A It could be. 23 Q It could be a big risk, it could be a little one, 24 but it creates a risk; and I'm not trying to quantify it right 25 now?

11 the evidence; right?

2018 1 A That's correct.

2 Q But that's a basic principle of forensic analysis; 3 correct? 4 A A basic principle. 5 Q If there was a gap in -- of who was handling the 6 evidence at a certain time, that's an open question; right? 7 A Yes, it is. 8 Q Once the device is acquired and we get it into the 9 vault, we get it into that room, the next stage is to actually 10 look -- extract the data; right? 11 A Yes, it is. 12 Q And there are a couple of ways -- well, there are a few 13 ways to do that; right? 14 A Yes. 15 Q One is manual extraction? 16 A Uh-huh. 17 Q Which is not really an extraction at all, it's just 18 looking at what's on the phone physically; right? 19 A Yes, that's correct. 20 Q Basically, taking screen shots of what you can see in 21 the phone as, like, I would look at my own phone as I was using 22 it; right? 23 A That's correct. 24 Q And there is equipment for that that can help you take 25 better pictures, but you really are, ultimately, just taking 2019 1 pictures of what's on the screen?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And this is, would you say, the least sophisticated way 4 to acquire data from an electronic device? 5 A The less sophisticated. 6 Q And so you can't access metadata in a meaningful way; 7 correct? 8 A No, you can't. 9 Q And you can't recover items deleted by the user; right?

10 A You cannot. 11 Q You can't look at the coding of specific files, like an 12 image that you see on a phone; right? 13 A No. 14 Q So there are other ways to do this; correct? 15 A There are. 16 Q And another one is a logical extraction? 17 A Uh-huh.

18 Q And so for a logical extraction, you are pulling the 19 data off of the device, sort of in the same format that it looks 20 -- the same way Windows looks, right, a folder, a hierarchical 21 formation; right? 22 A Files, yes. 23 Q What was that? 24 A Files. 25 Q I didn't hear you.

2020 1 A Files. Files. Folders.

2 Q Right. And this is, again, similar -- if you are 3 looking at a logical extraction, it's similar to the way that 4 you might look at the way you operate your PC from a Windows 5 environment? 6 A The same.

10 Q And you pull the data off the phone; correct? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And it brings the data on in this file folder 18 Q The unallocated space is where -- I'm going to use 19 layman's terms and you will fix it up for me -- it's where the 20 deleted stuff goes to reside? 21 A An artifact, yes.

22 Q And an artifact is a piece of data of one of these 23 items that you are examining; right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q And when you do a logical extraction, one of the 9 A That's correct. 7 Q And so in that way, say you connect the phone to a 8 piece of equipment in your lab; right?

14 A It does.

15 Q And is one of the drawbacks to this logical extraction 16 that it doesn't look at the unallocated space; right?

17 A That's correct. 13 structure?

2021 1 drawbacks is you can't tell what the user deleted or has not 2 deleted; isn't that right? 3 A Correct. 4 Q Yes. It just pulls out the information that was 5 present at the time that it was acquired? 6 A That's correct. 7 Q And there is a better way? 8 A Yes, a better way. 9 Q A physical acquisition?

10 A Yes, a physical acquisition in some ways is more of an 11 older approach for Apple iPhones. 13 Q And in a full file system, you are basically pulling a 14 forensic image of the whole memory chip? 15 A Yeah, the whole memory chip; that's correct. 16 Q And you -- and it's a process that you connect the 17 phone to a piece of equipment that you have and it pulls the 18 data out, and there is a giant -- depending on how much metadata 19 is on the phone, a giant file; right? 20 A That's correct. 21 Q And when it gets onto that equipment, it's ones and 22 zeroes; right? 23 A That's correct. 24 Q And so you need something to parse the data? 25 A You do.

12 It's a full file system.

2022 1 Q Parsing the data means converting ones and zeroes into 2 the types of things that you and I are used to looking at; 3 right? 4 A Yes. 5 Q And so pictures, right -- we looked at that picture of 6 Michael Cohen at the podium; right? 7 A That's correct. 8 Q That came onto your machine as ones and zeroes and then 9 you had some equipment that converted it so that you could see 10 what the picture looked like? 11 A Yes. 12 Q Same thing with the phone logs; right? 13 A It's in the format on the phone, yes. 14 Q It's pulled out as ones and zeroes parsed on your 15 machine, and ultimately generates these reports that we are 16 looking at in evidence; right? 17 A It does.

18 Q When you are working with these -- just to back up for 19 one minute, so we just talked about three methods: Manual, 20 logical, physical. 21 You did all of those on both of these phones; right? 22 A I did a full file system on the phone, that's it. 23 Q You also -- someone from your staff did a manual 24 review; correct? 25 A When I turned -- when I got the device, I simply 2023 1 plugged it into the device, pulled the extraction and then put 2 it away into evidence. 3 Q So there were other people from HTAU who worked on the 4 phone and did searches? 5 A There is. They are part of the investigative team, but 6 not at HTAU. 7 Q So it -- and I am just trying to understand 8 process-wise. 9 Is it possible that someone outside of HTAU did manual 10 searches on these device? 11 A Whoever had the phone before, some other agency, if 12 that's what you are asking. 13 Q Well, the FBI searched both of these phones before you 14 did; right? 15 A I heard that they did. 16 Q You know that they did; correct? 17 A I heard that they did, yes.

18 Q And we are going to talk about that. 19 But what I want to focus on right now is just what happened 20 when the phones were acquired at the District Attorney's office; 21 okay. 22 A (Nods head.) 23 Q Let's talk a little bit about the file, the BIN file, 24 the image that's pulled off. 25 A It's called the zip file.

2024 1 Q The zip file, that's pulled off of the extraction.

2 When a file is that big and it's pulled off in that way, 3 there is some risk that the data can degrade; is that correct? 4 A So once the data is pulled off, it's then hashed or 5 checks are done, which means that entire file gets a very unique 6 number that says this is the hash that contains all these 7 contents. If anything was affected, that hash file would 8 change. 9 Q Thank you. That's right where I was going.

10 So the hash value associated with the particular giant zip 11 file is like a digital fingerprint; right? 12 A It's a digital fingerprint. 13 Q Maybe even more detailed, like DNA for us; right? 14 A Sure. 15 Q If you trust the hash system you are using, if one of 16 those files with ones or zeroes changes, it's a different hash 17 value; correct?

18 A That's correct. 19 Q And this is a way to check on an ongoing basis the 20 integrity of the data that you are working with; right? 21 A Absolutely. 22 Q And it's a way to ensure that over points in time 23 during the acquisition and review process that the data itself 24 has not been manipulated; right? 25 A Each time you look at it, it hashes or verifies it each 2025 1 time you look at it.

2 Q That is an automatic process; right? 3 A It's automatic. 4 Q Just the checkmark, yes, the hashes match; correct? 5 A That's correct. 6 Q And that's because these hashes, if you are really 7 being secure about it, they are very, very long sets of numbers 10 Q You don't want to spend a lot of time checking those 11 numbers and letters one by one; right? 12 A You do not. 13 Q The computer does it for you. But it's as if, say, 14 fingerprints that match. If the hash is the same, these are the 15 same two types of -- this is the same file; right? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q And so you testified today about some of the artifacts 18 that you extracted from two phones that were acquired from 19 Michael Cohen; right? 20 A Yes, I did. 21 Q And these artifacts are segments of a much broader set 22 of data that was pulled off of each phone; correct? 23 A They are just segments. 24 Q That's because you are able to, once the data is 25 parsed, you can use the program to select what the pieces of it 8 and letters; right? 9 A Yes, they are.

2026 1 are that you want to highlight; right?

2 A You can. 3 Q So we have certain excerpts, but not the whole phone; 4 correct? 5 A That's correct. 6 Q You pulled certain excerpts that you were instructed to 7 pull by the Prosecutors; right? 8 A Of course. 9 Q And you don't know, do you, why they picked certain 10 things and not others? 11 A I'm not part of the investigative team. 12 Q And you are not a part of the investigative team, and 13 there are also situations where the evidence raises questions, 14 but they are not your questions to answer; right? 15 A That's correct. 16 Q And so, just as an example, we played -- I'm sorry, not 17 "we," -- the Government played a recording from September 6th of 18 2016, that was the metadata associated with that file; right? 19 Do you remember that? 20 A Yes, it was. 21 Q And there was a transcript associated with that, and we 22 put that up on the screen and as we listened. The audio cuts 23 off; right? 24 A Towards the end, yeah. 25 Q And you don't have firsthand knowledge of why it cuts 2027 1 off; right?

2 A I don't. I mean, I heard a phone call was coming in, 3 that's all I know. 4 Q So somebody gave you some instructions -- 5 A That's correct. 6 Q -- about why the phone was cut off; right? 7 A Yes. 8 Q But, as a result, you know that that wasn't the whole 9 conversation; correct?

10 A That's correct. 11 Q And you don't know what was going on before or after; 12 right? 13 A I do not. 14 Q And you were instructed, were you not, to check the 15 phone itself, the physical device, to see if there was incoming 16 or outgoing calls on it around the time of that recording?

19 Q You -- at one point you prepared a report, did you not, 20 of all incoming and outgoing calls on CP1, the device from which 21 that recording was extracted? 22 A Yes, those reports were pulled after. 23 Q And you found a call around the time of the recording 24 on the physical device; correct? 25 A I wasn't specifically asked to look at that.

17 A Look at -- I wasn't instructed, per se, to look at the 18 calls coming in at that time.

2028 1 Q But, you do know that the recording cuts off. And you 2 don't know what happened after that; right? 3 A Just that it cut off. 5 A That's correct. 6 Q I want to now get back to the actual acquisition 8 These came to HTAU on January 23rd of 2023; right?

10 Q And I'm being a little imprecise. There are two 11 iPhones; right? 13 Q If I say CP1 and CP2, you will know what I mean? 14 A I will. 15 Q And at the time these phones came to HTAU, is it your 16 testimony that you were not provided with the copies that the 17 FBI had seized?

18 A Yeah, I did not receive those. 19 Q You did not have access to the data that the FBI seized 20 from these devices in 2018; did you? 21 A I did not. 22 Q And you did not ask for that data; did you? 23 A I did not. 24 Q And you didn't ask any questions about what the FBI had 25 done to the devices in 2018; correct?

7 process for these two devices. 9 A They did come to our Office, yes.

12 A That's right.

4 Q And you don't know what was going on before that?

2029 1 A That is correct.

2 Q And there -- this acquisition process, there are so 3 many different ways to do it, some of the acquisition processes 4 are more invasive than others; right? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Well -- 7 A Manually looking at a device is invasive. 8 Q And so, just to clarify, when I was using the term 9 "manual" earlier, I mean, taking some pictures on the top of the 10 phone? 11 (Indicating.) 12 A That's correct. 13 Q There are also really invasive methods, other types of 14 methods; right? 15 A Right. 16 Q Rip the phone apart; right? 17 A For Androids, not for Apple iPhones.

18 Q And that's a specific situation where you really can't 19 do a second search; right? 20 A That's correct. 21 Q And in addition to there being acquisition processes 22 that are particularly invasive, there is room for user error in 23 the acquisition process; right? 24 A Sure.

25 Q And so, if somebody makes a mistake at one point in the
2030 1 acquisition, that can affect the data; correct?

2 A It could. 3 Q And that is why, for example, you are in these Faraday 4 rooms; right? 5 A Uh-huh. That's correct. 6 Q That's why you received a lot of training; right? 7 A That's correct. 8 Q And there is at least, at least a risk that a prior 9 acquisition and extraction could impact the data that you looked 10 at in 2023; isn't there? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q And you didn't talk to the FBI about the methods they 13 used; did you? 14 A I did not. 15 Q And as far as you know, nobody at this table did? 16 A As far as I know. 17 Q It's an open question?

18 A That it is. 19 THE COURT: Is this a good time? 20 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge. 21 THE COURT: All right. Jurors, we are going to 23 Before you leave, and before I give you the 24 required admonitions, I did want you to know that it was 25 brought to my attention that one of your fellow jurors has 22 stop here. Call it a day.

2031 3 quarter to four. 4 I just want to let you know now so you can plan 5 ahead. 6 Jurors, I ask you to, please, not talk amongst 7 yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the 8 case. 9 Please continue to keep an open mind.

10 Do not form or express an opinion about the 11 defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is 12 in and I have given you my final instructions on the law and 13 you begin your deliberations. 14 Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss 15 with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or 16 benefit in return for supplying any information concerning 17 this trial.

19 knowledge involving an attempt by any person to improperly 20 influence you or any member of the jury. 23 And do not use any program or electronic device 24 to search for and view any location discussed in the 25 testimony. 18 Report directly to me any incident within your 21 Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed 22 in the testimony.
