STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 5 Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Matthew 6 Colangelo, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis.

9 THE COURT: Good morning, Counsel.

10 Good morning, Mr. Trump. 11 THE COURT: First, I want to thank you all for 12 working out your schedule so that you could be here at 14 As you know, there were a couple of issues that 15 came up over the weekend. I wanted to be able to address 16 them before the jury got here, so they wouldn't have to 17 wait. 13 8:45. 18 As a result of some of those issues, which we'll 19 discuss momentarily, and upon further consideration, as 20 you know, it's become apparent that we're not going to be 21 able to sum up tomorrow.

22 The details of the scheduling for the rest of the 23 week will be discussed later. 24 But, right now, it's looking much more like we're 25 going to be finishing up everything that's evidence, 7 MR. BLANCHE: Todd Blanche, joined by Emil Bove, 8 Susan Necheles, and President Trump seated to my left.

3993 1 testimony, pre-charge conferences this week, so that we 2 can have summations first thing Tuesday, without a break, 3 and then we can have the charge and begin deliberations. 4 It was either have a long break now or have a 5 long break then. 6 And, unfortunately, the calendar is what it is.

7 So, let's begin with the issue that you brought 8 to my attention regarding Defense Exhibits. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Good morning, your Honor.

10 Initially, Mr. Blanche had provided us 17 11 exhibits to which we had a number of objections.

12 He has since then pared them back. 13 We have objections now only to two. 14 We just worked out this morning with Mr. Blanche 15 a redaction to one, which had embedded hearsay, which we 16 had an objection to.

17 Now we have just one exhibit we have an objection 18 to, which we believe is hearsay. Defense Exhibit B1005. 19 I can hand it up.

20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is given to the Court.) 21 MS. HOFFINGER: This is entirely hearsay, your 22 Honor. It's a third person reporting in an email about 23 what Mr. Costello said in a meeting. 24 So, certainly, if Mr. Costello testifies, he can 25 testify to the substance of the meeting.

1 But, this is hearsay, and we object.

2 THE COURT: Give me one second to read it.

3994 3 (Whereupon, the Court reviews the exhibit.) 4 MR. BLANCHE: 1005 is an email from 12 That is direct impeachment against what Mr. Cohen 13 testified to, both on direct and on cross, on Tuesday and 17 Letter, and they were still working things out. 18 We are not offering this for the truth, but it's 19 certainly impeachment we can offer and cross him on it.

20 THE COURT: It would be the truth of the 21 statement you're impeaching him with; right?

22 MR. BLANCHE: Well, it depends how he answers it. 23 THE COURT: Well, how he answers it, at that 24 point the cat is out of the bag, the jury heard it.

25 So, how do you get past the hearsay argument? 15 He testified that he didn't feel like he clicked 16 with Mr. Costello, they had given him an Engagement 9 with the discussion, I know you have my cell, and that 10 you're involved on multiple fronts, I'm glad we can help 11 bring you some peace.

14 Thursday.

5 Mr. Costello's partner to Mr. Cohen following their 6 initial communications.

7 What Mr. Citron says to Mr. Cohen about what he 8 had talked to Mr. Costello about is they were very pleased 3995 1 MR. BLANCHE: Impeachment evidence, you're 2 allowed to impeach with hearsay evidence. There's nothing 3 wrong with that.

6 for the truth of the matter asserted.

14 THE COURT: Which meeting are you referring to, 15 specifically? 16 MR. BLANCHE: This is the initial meeting, when 17 they first met. 23 partner, Mr. Costello, about their views of how the 24 meeting went with Mr. Cohen, which is, potentially, 25 different than what -- not "potentially" -- that's 11 So, if he testifies something different happened 12 than what this email suggests -- it's not to say this 13 email is right. 18 There was a couple of phone calls, your Honor, 19 and they met at a hotel with Mr. Cohen, and then there was 20 a follow-up phone call. 21 And so, what this -- what this email is about, 22 apparently, is Mr. Citron's communication with his 4 THE COURT: Not for the truth. Not for the truth.

5 MR. BLANCHE: Well, I'm not offering this email 7 I'm offering it because there, presumably, will 8 be testimony -- unless he says something different 9 today -- that what happened at the meeting is different 10 than what this email suggests.

3996 1 different from what Mr. Cohen testified to last Tuesday 2 and last Thursday. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, Mr. Citron's opinion of 4 their efforts to provide him with some comfort is not an 5 impeachment of Mr. Cohen's view of how he felt the meeting 6 went and his views about whether he wanted to retain him.

9 Again -- this is opinion, also. This is a 12 comfort. 13 This doesn't disclose what's in Michael Cohen's 14 mind and how he felt about the meeting and how he felt 15 about retaining or not retaining the firm. 16 MR. BLANCHE: It's to Mr. Cohen.

17 This isn't an email amongst partners talking 18 about something. 23 the People directly, of views of the person. 24 THE COURT: There's another layer of hearsay 10 lawyer's opinion, pitching a client, saying: We would like 11 to give you some comfort; allow me to give you some 20 THE COURT: Expressing Mr. Citron's opinion. 21 MR. BLANCHE: To Mr. Cohen.

22 There's a lot of emails admitted, including by 19 This is an email to Mr. Cohen.

7 Whether it's impeachment or not, this is still 8 hearsay, so it should not be admissible.

25 here. It wasn't sent by Mr. Citron. It was sent by Diana 3997 1 Porcello on behalf of Mr. Citron. There's another layer of 2 hearsay. 3 At this point, at this moment, I'm not going to 4 allow it in.

5 It expresses the opinion, arguably, of Mr. Citron 6 or Mr. Costello.

14 Those all come in.

15 Of course, whether those are the truth depends 16 on -- whether Mr. Cohen believes that's a truthful 17 statement depends on his answer or on what he wrote in 18 response to such an email, potentially; right. 19 The fact that there isn't a response to this 20 email and the fact that he will be allowed to say whether 21 this is true or not is consistent with the other emails 22 that have already been admitted around this relationship. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I just don't see it. 24 In other words, he's going to opine on whether 25 they had a view as a firm, whether they could pitch work 7 It doesn't express the opinion of Mr. Cohen. 8 I don't think you can impeach him on this. 9 MR. BLANCHE: The People offered several exhibits 10 that were emails to Mr. Cohen like this one that expressed 11 some sort of opinion by the author; right. Meaning, the 12 author is saying to Mr. Cohen: We met, or, here's what I 13 did after what you directed me to do.

3998 1 for him where they say: I'm glad we can give you some 2 comfort. 3 They may have been on different playing fields on 4 how they felt about the meeting.

5 The exhibits admitted were admitted, and they 6 were on Mr. Cohen's state of mind on why he made decisions 7 on how to act for a period of time and, including, why he 10 THE COURT: I don't see any probative value for 11 impeachment purposes here at all.

12 Nowhere in this email does it express Mr. Cohen's 13 state of mind. 14 You can certainly ask him some follow-up 15 questions if you like. 16 Right now, this is double hearsay, and it's not 17 Mr. Cohen's state of mind. 18 So, I'm not going to allow it. 19 Please hand this back down.

20 MR. BLANCHE: Assuming it's okay with the Court, 21 I'll show him the email and ask him a series of questions 22 and, depending on his answers, potentially, offer it at 23 that point. 24 THE COURT: What kind of questions would you ask 25 him?

8 did not tell the truth for a period of time, including to 9 Mr. Costello.

3999 1 MR. BLANCHE: For example, confirm he didn't 2 respond to this email; and, arguably, it would be an 3 admission by silence.

23 wants to take up?

4 There's dozens and dozens of emails back and 5 forth amongst Mr. Cohen and Mr. Costello and Mr. Citron 6 over a two or three-month period.

7 So, him receiving this email, testifying last 8 week that this wasn't his impression, the jury has a right 9 to see how he reacted to him being told at the time about 10 what the lawyers' impression was of the meeting. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: I would object.

12 They shouldn't be able to show him this. 13 Again, this is a third person's opinion -- 14 THE COURT: So, once you start asking the witness 15 these questions out of the presence of the jury, the jury 16 doesn't see the email; right. So, now, they're all sitting 17 there, wondering what is going on, what are you talking 18 about. They won't understand that testimony. It's going to 19 be confusing.

20 So, I'm not going to allow it. 21 I'm prepared to rule on the expert witness issue.

22 But, is there anything else that either side 24 MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, I don't know if you want 25 to do this now or at another time. There's a couple of 4000 1 additional points that we want to raise about the charge, 2 but we can wait until we have the pre-charge conference if 3 that's preferable. They're minor points. 4 THE COURT: Actually, let me go through this 5 first, and then we'll decide if we can take that up. 6 On Thursday, May 16th, the Defense made an 7 application to this Court regarding the scope of 19 terms.

8 permissible testimony from their expert, Brad Smith, who 9 the Defense intends to call to testify regarding Campaign 10 Finance Law. Defendant pointed to this Court's decisions 11 on Motions in Limine and, in particular, to this Court's 12 ruling that the expert could testify as to general 13 definitions and terms that relate directly to the case, 14 such as, for example: campaign contribution, relative 15 individual campaign contribution limits, expenditure, and 16 coordinated expenditure.

17 Defendant specifically requested permission to 18 elicit testimony from Mr. Smith about the three separate 20 First, the term, "For the purpose of influencing 21 an election for Federal office."
22 As I understand it, in order to define this term, 23 the expert would rely upon legal precedent, including the 24 Supreme Court's decision in Buckley and the D.C. Circuit's 25 decision in Orloski.

4001 3 other things, testimony regarding the Federal Register 4 Provision that discusses the FEC. 7 I won't go into the "Press Exemption" here 8 because you both submitted your exceptions as to that.

13 But, an expert is not permitted to present or 14 interpret the law.

15 However, it seems to this Court that it will be 16 impossible for Mr. Smith to testify about these three 22 In his argument on Thursday, Mr. Bove offered 23 that Mr. Smith would only testify as to very basic matters 24 and, at a bare minimum.

25 See Thursday's transcript on Page 238.

1 The second term is the, "Irrespective Rule."
2 Here, the Defendant would like to elicit, among 5 They would also like to rely upon agency advisory 6 opinions and agency adjudications.

9 Ordinarily, expert testimony is permissible to 10 assist the jury in understanding topics that are beyond 11 the ken of the average juror. For example, DNA evidence, 12 blood splatter evidence, and countless other fields. 17 subjects without invoking, discussing and interpreting the 18 application of Federal Law in the form of legal precedent, 19 advisory opinions, agency adjudications, and even the 20 purpose and intent behind the creation of some of these 21 rules.

4002 1 However, it is difficult to reconcile how an 9 If Mr. Smith is permitted to testify to these 2 expert would testify to the very basic topics and, yet, 3 have to rely on Supreme Court decisions, other legal 4 precedent, advisory opinions, agency adjudications, and 5 even the Federal Register to explain how and why the 6 provisions were developed.

7 Clearly, this would virtually all fall under the 8 umbrella of legal opinion.

10 subjects, the People would have to be given an opportunity 11 to offer an expert to testify as to these same legal 12 principles, as well. 13 The jury would then hear my instructions on the 14 law, as well as the instructions from two others. As 15 Mr. Colangelo pointed out on Thursday, the jury would hear 16 legal instructions from three different people: the 17 Defense expert, the People's expert, and the Court. 18 As Mr. Bove alluded to last week, there is no 19 question this would result in a battle of the experts, 20 which will only serve to confuse and not assist the jury. 21 Indeed, Mr. Smith has been precluded from 22 testifying about similar matters in the Southern District 23 of New York by Federal District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan 24 in the matter of United States v. Bankman-Fried. There, 25 Judge Kaplan found the testimony was improper precisely 4003 1 because it sought to instruct the jury on matters of law.

2 Likewise, Mr. Smith was precluded from testifying 3 about similar subjects in United States v. Suarez in the 9 The same holds true here.

10 The fact that both parties have submitted 15 The proposed jury instructions are just that: 16 proposals.

17 The Court will hear argument, consider the 18 submissions, and then decide whether to accept one 19 version, or the other, or a combination of both, or 23 jury instructions regarding the "Irrespective Rule" and 24 "For the purpose of influencing an election for Federal 25 office". 20 possibly neither. The Court may craft its own instructions 21 or decide that no instruction is necessary at all.

22 Therefore, I again invite you to submit proposed 4 Northern District of Ohio. In Suarez, the Court ruled that 5 the proposed testimony was irrelevant because, quote: 6 Whether the law is commonly misunderstood does not weigh 7 on whether the defendant in this case intended to violate 8 Campaign Finance Laws.

11 proposed jury instructions does not change this Court's 12 prior rulings on the Omnibus Motions and the Motions in 13 Limine and does not in itself make relevant what is not 14 relevant.

4004 1 I believe you both already submitted proposals 2 for the "Press Exemption". 3 Having said that, that does not, necessarily, 4 mean I will use either one or the other. I may not 5 instruct the jury on either one of those rules. 6 As far as what the expert can testify to, I
7 direct you back to Page 3 of my decision. 8 He can testify as to what the FEC is, its 9 purpose, background as to who makes up the FEC, what laws, 20 sub-phrases or sub-definitions. 21 I invite both sides to come to the charge 22 conference prepared to argue these issues, and I also 23 invite you to submit written proposals in advance of the 24 charge conference.

25 Any questions about that?

10 if any, the FEC are responsible for enforcing, and general 11 definitions and terms related directly to this case, such 12 as "contribution", "expenditure", and "independent 13 expenditure". 14 By "general definitions", I mean just that.

15 Where the FEC has defined a general term, the expert can 16 refer to that definition, but he cannot interpret it.

17 I also do not want the expert to delve into 18 defining words or phrases contained within a word or 19 phrase he is already defining. In other words, no 4005 1 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.

2 Thank you. And we appreciate the guidance. 3 I think the challenge for us is, is that the 23 telling the jury what legal terms mean. 24 I do think things changed a little bit when both 25 sides proposed additional instructions on FECA.

4 phrases that your Honor referred to, "For the purpose of 5 influencing an election" and the regulatory phrase that we 6 all described as the "Irrespective Rule", those are just 7 absolutely critical to the jury understanding the 8 Government's allegations in this case. 9 And so, coming into the trial, our plan and our 10 hope, based on your Honor's ruling, was that we would give 11 the jury guidance on those issues through Mr. Smith, on 12 the understanding -- on the understanding, your Honor, 13 that in The Trump Organization trial you had not 14 instructed the jury down to the level of a 175.10 15 predicate and, also, on the understanding that in pretrial 16 motion practice, I think under People v. Mackey, if I
17 remember correctly, the Government had taken the same 18 position. 19 So, that was our strategy coming into the trial, 20 understanding that there is some tension in that strategy, 21 with us needing the jury to understand what those terms 22 mean, but also the traditional role of the Court in 4006 24 I am wondering if you are willing to give us any 25 sense on the way you're leaning, if you're going to 1 To be clear, our instructions we submitted last 2 week do include instructions related to the terms at 3 issue, "For the purpose of influencing a Federal election" 4 and "Irrespective Rule", especially because the 5 "influencing" conduct is part of the texts of 6 "contribution" and "expenditure", as the Court knows.

7 The tough spot that we're in right now, I think, 8 is that your Honor has not indicated a firm intention to 9 instruct the jury on FECA. And so, we're in a place where 10 we're -- we understand the Court's ruling. 11 You have our position.

12 We're restricted in what Mr. Smith could say. 13 And, frankly, Mr. Smith reading the texts of 14 those statutory definitions is not going to help the jury 15 grapple with the issues that these charges present and 16 that the Government, from their new theory of this case, 17 presents. 18 I know it's not the best position, for a lawyer 19 to be asking questions to the Court. It usually goes in 20 the other direction. I understand that. 21 But, we are trying to make decisions about our 22 defense, how to present it. It impacts closings and the 23 charge conference.

4007 3 obviously, we would come to the pre-charge conference, 23 The problem that you have, as I see it, is that 24 your client can't testify to these definitions without 25 invoking the law.

1 instruct the jury on the FECA issues. If that's the case, 2 that would be helpful for us to understand, because, 4 both sides, armed up with authorities and the authorities 5 they cited. From our cite, they would sound like whatever 6 in our best world Mr. Smith would say to the jury. And we 7 would, ultimately, resolve that at the charge conference. 8 The issue for us, what would be helpful in terms 9 of clarity is anything you can give us is the Court's 10 intention on instructing the jury on these issues. 11 I think it's undisputed among the parties that 12 it's appropriate the way the Government constructed the 13 predicate and the underlying activity. 14 THE COURT: I think at this point, beyond -- as 15 you already referred to the way I instructed the jury in 16 the People v. The Trump Organization, I can tell you, when 17 it comes to these types of matters, I often think that 18 less is better. 19 I think that is -- you must remember, the People 20 are not required to prove these offenses beyond a 21 reasonable doubt; therefore, that reduces the need or the 22 burden to define every term and every phrase.

4008 16 review.

17 He's a former Commissioner of the FEC. He has an 18 authoritative view on what these things mean. 19 Is that based on interpretations of the law?

20 Yeah. He's a lawyer. That makes sense on the basis for it. 21 We were not going to get into the details based 22 on the Valeo and Orloski arguments on Thursday. 23 That's one issue. 24 I want to clarify. If there were no restrictions, 25 what we would do, ideally, when we're presenting our 4 opinions or how these matters have been interpreted, how 5 the law has been interpreted, he might be able to take the 6 stand and do that. But he can't. Not the way I see it 7 right now. 8 MR. BOVE: Sensing the signals you gave us on 9 Thursday, in working with Mr. Smith this weekend, I was 10 pretty clear with him: We're not talking through Buckley 11 v. Valeo. We're not going to talk to this jury about 12 Orloski. 13 This was my idea working with him last night: 14 What we want is for you to explain to the jury what these 15 terms mean, and we won't get into the bases of your 1 You haven't told me that he can.

2 If you were to tell me that he can take the stand 3 and, without relying on legal precedent or advisory 4009 4 And then, multiple times in that testimony he 5 will include in that definition, "For the purpose of 6 influencing the election."
7 And then I would elicit: What does that term 8 mean?

20 MR. BOVE: I understand that. 21 So -- so -- I completely understand that point.

22 I do think, though, that we're still in a very 23 tricky situation, because the way the Government has 24 structured these business records charges -- I understand 25 we're not going to have a pre-charge conference now. But, 11 And he would not say: My understanding is based 12 on this and that and this, and then it would be the 13 Government's -- 14 THE COURT: You're offering him as an expert.

15 MR. BOVE: Right. 16 THE COURT: A lawyer, an expert in this field.

17 Therefore, he doesn't have to say he relied on a 18 Supreme Court decision. He's still presenting the law with 19 the authority of a legal expert.

9 And he would explain his answer as an expert, 10 offering an opinion about what the term means.

1 defense case, is I would ask a series of questions: What 2 does expenditure mean? What does contribution mean? The 3 terms your Honor outlined.

4010 1 there's one point that I want to make. This is a 2 fundamentally different charging structure than what 3 happened at the prior trial.

6 that.

7 THE COURT: Forgive me for interrupting you. 8 How they structured it in their proposal at this 22 And so, otherwise, it's just an agreement to try 23 to win an election. 24 That's why I think that statute has not been 25 applied very many times.

9 moment carries no weight. The Court could very well decide 10 I agree with you a hundred percent, that the way that they 11 presented it is not appropriate.

12 I'm not sure that I agree with you that there's a 13 change in theory. 14 But, I do see what you're talking about when 15 you're talking as to structure in their proposed charges. 16 MR. BOVE: My point is, what makes this case 17 different, then, is that the predicate for the 175.10 18 charge, this New York Election Law conspiracy, that 19 conspiracy to influence the election, to promote a 20 candidate, the statutory language is: "only unlawful if 21 there is unlawful activity."
4 At the prior trial, I think the predicates were 5 really substantive charges, and the jury got a sense of 4011 1 There is a -- the charges in this case require a 2 showing of a predicate; and then for that, on the 3 Government's theory today, as of the proposed 4 instructions, there is a -- there has to be a predicate of 5 the predicate. 6 THE COURT: All right.

11 Motions in Limine remains the same. I offered guidance in 14 position would be.

21 case, their case in chief.

22 You're asking me for further guidance, but that's 23 precisely why we have a pre-charge conference, so that you 24 know exactly what you can use on summations.

25 It would be inappropriate for me to tell you 7 Just to clarify, when you refer to being in a 8 difficult position, I want to be clear, the Court has not 9 changed its position from day one. My decision on the 10 Omnibus Decision remains the same. My decisions on the 12 those motions. And, therefore, you've known for months -- 13 this is not new -- you've known for months what my 15 If you had concerns about these specific topics 16 and you wanted an earlier ruling, you could have come to 17 me -- just relax. 18 You could have come to me for an earlier ruling 19 some time ago. But you didn't. And now, you've waited 20 until the People are basically done with their direct 4012 1 right now what my charge is going to be without hearing 2 from both sides what the recommendations are. 3 MR. BOVE: I understand, Judge. 4 What has changed, the reason that we didn't come 5 to you, say, at the February hearing on this is because at 6 that point in the Government's theory of the case, FECA
25 But, the way it's structured now -- we did, 7 was still a 175.10 predicate on our understanding. 8 I think that's the way that your Honor described 9 it in the Omnibus rulings.

10 From what -- from our perspective -- I understand 11 what you're saying.

12 From our perspective, what is new is FECA is now 13 buried under the New York Election Law predicate. 14 What makes that difficult, we submit, is that the 15 Government has to establish there was intent -- intent to 16 defraud and intent to conceal a crime.

17 That New York Election Law charge is only a crime 18 if people who were part of that conspiracy, there was an 19 agreement, and it had to be to violate the law.

20 So, there is no 175.10 predicate -- this is our 21 argument -- unless there's a FECA violation or -- I know 22 about the tax and the business records charge. We'll talk 23 about that at the charge conference and when we talk about 24 the sufficiency of the Government's case.

4013 1 respectfully, learn about that when the People submitted 2 their instructions. So, it was recent, in fairness to us. 3 THE COURT: Again, it's just a proposed 4 instruction. That's all it is.

12 theories. I ruled that they could not use one of those 13 four theories, and there were three theories left. 14 To the extent it's your opinion -- and I think 22 THE COURT: It's all right. 23 MR. BOVE: From our perspective, the way -- 24 however your Honor is going to treat the Government's 25 proposal, the way the Government's proposal is structured 9 THE COURT: I can tell you that I'm going to be 10 consistent with my earlier rulings. 11 If you recall, the People initially had four 15 there's some merit to your argument -- that it appears 16 there might not be one theory and that the others are 17 being kind of inserted to that one theory, I can tell you, 18 the Court has taken note of that. 19 MR. BOVE: So, the only point I'm making -- this 20 is a very long windup. I'm sorry. 21 We appreciate you being here.

5 MR. BOVE: I can't imagine your Honor is going to 6 put to the jury a theory that's different than the one the 7 People are explaining of the case. 8 That's all I mean.

4014 1 adds significance for the need for this jury to understand 2 what FECA obligated people to do and did not obligate 3 people to do. 4 We're not seeking to offer testimony from 5 Mr. Smith like the testimony from Suarez you referenced, 6 that the law is confused and -- that's not what we want to 7 do. 8 Fundamentally, our issue and our concern right 11 THE COURT: Why don't we do this. I'd like to 24 means -- that's a part of the Election Law violation.

25 We specifically said: The evidence is sufficient 9 now is that these two -- it's the phrases at issue, For 10 "the purpose of influencing election" --
12 give them a chance, as well. Give me an offer of proof 13 what he would say. Tell me what he would say in response 14 to those questions, and I'd be in a better position to 15 determine whether it's an appropriate response or not. 16 Let me hear from the People.

17 MR. COLANGELO: Three quick points. 18 First, to respond to the argument that any aspect 19 of the People's Election Law violation theory is new, we 20 briefed this quite explicitly in Opposition to the 21 Defendant's Omnibus Motion, which we filed November 9th of 22 last year. In that Opposition, I'm looking at Page 25, we 23 identified violations of FECA as among the unlawful 4015 1 to support the conclusion that Defendant and others 2 conspired to promote the election of any person to a 3 public office by entering into the scheme, specifically 6 including by violating FECA through the unlawful, 23 I think, in some ways, what Mr. Bove just said, 24 asking your Honor for a preview of what you will do in the 25 charge conference, is to say: If your Honor is not 7 individual and corporate contributions by Cohen, Pecker 8 and AMI, and by falsifying the records of other New York 9 enterprises, and mischaracterizing the nature of their 10 payment for tax purposes. 11 So, dating back at least six months, we have been 12 clear to the Defense and to the Court that the Election 13 Law object crime relied for its unlawful meanings theory, 14 the unlawful FECA violations, unlawful false filings of 15 business records, and tax violations. 16 So, there's nothing new at all about the unlawful 17 means argument in our Election Law theory. 18 The second point I would make, as the Court has 19 just said, the Judge should and will charge on appropriate 20 legal definitions in the charge conference, and the 21 Defense is not entitled to have an expert front-end that 22 process.

4 for the purpose of influencing the 2016 presidential 5 election, and that they did so by unlawful means, 4016 5 instruction. 6 We agree with Your Honor's conclusion this 20 So, it's very hard to see how -- beyond the 21 barest definition included in the text alone, with nothing 22 more, it's hard to see how any testimony here could 23 proceed within the appropriate boundaries the Court has 24 set and could proceed within those boundaries without 25 inviting responsive testimony for the battle of the 1 inclined to include those definitions, that's why they 2 need the expert to testify. 3 That's a back-door way around what your Honor 4 ultimately decides as to what is an appropriate legal 7 morning that the Court should review the legal 8 submissions, hear arguments at a pre-charge conference, 9 and then decide what the charge should be.

10 Obviously, we're interested in hearing any other 11 offer of proof, as well.

12 I think Mr. Bove just said: Precisely because 13 Mr. Smith is a lawyer and a law professor and a former 14 Commissioner of the FEC, his entire experience in 15 understanding how these terms apply is based on 16 interpretation.

17 I think the transcript will show Mr. Bove just 18 said his understanding of how these terms are defined is 19 based on interpretation.

4017 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1 experts the Court is concerned about. 2 Thank you.

4018 1 Proceedings 2 1 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were 3 2 preceded by a sealed discussion at sidebar.)
4 3 (Whereupon, the following proceedings are held at 5 4 sidebar:)
6 5 MR. BLANCHE: So, as it stands right now, we 7 6 have, potentially, Mr. Smith; potentially, Mr. Costello; 8 7 and then our paralegal to put in one phone chart, which is 9 8 very quick.

10 9 We, obviously, need to think about Mr. Smith.

11 10 Honestly, we're going to think about 12 11 Mr. Costello, depending how this morning goes.

13 12 There's still a lot up in the air.

14 13 That's where we're at.

15 14 THE COURT: Okay.

16 15 Do you think this changes things at all as far as 17 16 the scheduling, or are we still on the same track?

18 17 MR. BLANCHE: I'll let everybody speak.

19 18 I think the problems you identified yesterday 20 19 remain, no matter who testifies or who does not testify 21 20 today, because even if we're finished and everybody rests 22 21 by the afternoon today, we're still on a tight schedule to 23 22 have a full charge conference with complicated issues, 24 23 have your Honor make a decision, tell us what the decision 25 24 is going to be, sum up tomorrow -- I don't need to restate 26 25 the same things -- spill over to Thursday. You may charge 27 Laurie Eisenberg, CSR, RPR
28 Senior Court Reporter 4019 1 them or maybe not.

2 THE COURT: Just so you know, I was just handed a 3 note, telling me that the alternate who had to leave by 4 one o'clock on Thursday has canceled his appointment, so 5 we no longer have to stop at one o'clock on Thursday. 6 I don't know that that really changes much, 7 because in the back of my mind, one of the options was 8 just to continue without him, anyway. 9 I don't think that changes much.

10 Look. You've all worked really hard on this case, 11 well before we stepped foot in this courtroom.

12 I don't think that we should rush through the 13 jury charges and the pre-charge conference. 14 We want to get this right. We all want to get it 15 right. 16 I want to hear your arguments. I want to be able 17 to research it. 18 I want to give you the proposed charges with as 19 much notice as possible so you can prepare your 20 summations. 21 Believe me, I would hate to be down from today 22 until next Tuesday. I've never done that. But, I think 23 that's what's in the best interest of the case. 24 MR. STEINGLASS: Can I ask a quick question -- of 25 course, we're fine with that.

4020 1 Obviously, we all want to get it right. 2 I agree with that.

3 Are you thinking about the charge conference 4 tomorrow, or are you thinking about the charge conference 5 this afternoon?

6 Does it depend on when the testimony ends? 7 THE COURT: It depends.

8 If the testimony ends sometime today, I think we 9 can have the charge conference tomorrow afternoon, so we 10 can all prepare for it.

11 I think I definitely want to have it before 12 Thursday.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: I totally agree. 14 Tomorrow, at the latest, would be perfect. 15 THE COURT: We'll shoot for tomorrow afternoon.

5 4 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 6 5 in open court:)
7 6 THE COURT: Let's take a short ten-minute break.

8 7 We'll start up around 9:30.

9 8 (Whereupon, a recess is taken.)
10 9 ************************************
11 10 THE CLERK: Remain seated.

12 11 Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.

13 12 THE COURT: Going back to my request that you 14 13 submit the proposals, what I would like is for one side or 15 14 the other to draft a proposal as to each one of these 16 15 theories, give it to the other side. Then I can get 17 16 redline version of it and see where you differ.

18 17 Because, the safer course may be, at the end of 19 18 the day, to keep things as simple as possible for the 20 19 jury.

21 20 And, if the two sides can agree on the 22 21 definitions of these terms, that's all the better.

23 22 You decide who wants to draft it and who wants to 24 23 do the redline. You can send it to me.

25 24 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.

26 25 THE COURT: Let's get the witness, please.

28 Senior Court Reporter 4022 1 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

2 (Whereupon, the witness, Michael Cohen, having 3 been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the 4 witness stand and testifies as follows:) 5 THE COURT: Good morning, Mr. Cohen. Welcome 6 back.

7 I remind you, you're still under oath.

8 THE WITNESS: Good morning, your Honor. 9 THE COURT: Let's get the jury, please.

10 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 11 Jury entering.

12 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 13 are present and properly seated.) 14 THE CLERK: Do all parties stipulate that all 15 jurors are present and properly seated? 16 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

17 MR. BOVE: Yes.

18 THE COURT: Thank you. 19 Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. 20 Counsel, you may inquire. 21 MR. BLANCHE: May I?

22 CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION
23 BY MR. BLANCHE: 24 Q Good morning, Mr. Cohen. 25 A Good morning.

4023 1 Q So, we ended last Thursday. Since that time until 2 right now, how many reporters have you talked to about what 3 happened last week? 4 A I didn't speak to reporters about what happened last 5 week. 6 Q You didn't speak to a single reporter about what 7 happened last week? 8 A I have spoken to reporters who just called to say 9 hello, to see how I'm doing, to check in. But I did not talk 10 about this case. 11 Q So, the reporters you spoke with just greeted you and 12 asked how you were doing, didn't speak at all about your 13 testimony last week? 14 A Correct.

15 Q Now, you -- prior to your testimony -- let's focus on 16 2024.

17 So, just since the beginning of this year, you talked to 18 reporters pretty extensively about this case; correct? 19 A I have, yes.

20 Q Again, just focus on this year. 21 Did you -- how many times did you meet with the Prosecutors 22 of this case, again, just this year, in 2024? 23 A More than a dozen. 24 Q More than a dozen.

25 Like, more than 12, but -- 20 times?

4024 1 A It's possible, yes.

2 Q Well -- and I'm not looking for an exact number, but 3 is it closer to 20 or closer to 12? 4 A Probably closer to 20.

5 Q Were those meetings all more than an hour? 6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q Were some of them more than two hours? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q When is the most recent time you met with them?

10 A Approximately ten days ago.

14 Q When you met with the Prosecutors -- again, just 15 focused on this year, 2024 -- they asked you questions similar 16 to what they asked you last Monday or Tuesday; right?

17 A They asked me questions, yes, sir.

18 Q Right. 19 But, that wasn't my question to you.

20 They asked you questions similar to the questions they 21 asked you on the stand on Monday and Tuesday of last week; 22 correct? 23 A The same topics, yes, sir. 24 Q Well, the topic you testified to hasn't changed in 25 your prep with them for a long time; right?

13 A Yes, sir.

11 Q So, you testified on Monday -- you started to testify 12 on Monday of last week. Was it over the prior weekend?

4025 1 A Correct.

2 Q So, my question is different than the way you're 3 answering. 4 When they asked you questions last Monday and Tuesday, 5 okay, when Ms. Hoffinger asked you questions, you had heard 6 those questions from her before, during prep; correct?

7 A Some of them. Not all of them.

12 Q So, you heard many questions last Monday or Tuesday 13 that you were hearing for the very first time? 14 A Yes, sir.

15 Q How about documents?

19 People; right?

20 A That's correct. 21 Q And there were some emails and documents, I assume, 22 that you were shown in prep that you were not shown last week; 23 meaning you went over them in prep, but they, ultimately, 24 weren't shown to you by the People last week; right?

25 A Correct.

10 A (Shakes head). I can't tell you. There were many 11 questions that I have not heard before.

16 The documents that you were shown by the People last Monday 17 and Tuesday and the emails and text messages and the records 18 and the invoices, you had reviewed those in prep with the 8 Q What's a question you were asked last week that you 9 were hearing for the first time?

4026 4 A Correct, sir.

5 Q Maybe not more than 20 times. 6 Any time you prep to be under oath, you meet with your 7 lawyer and other people, and you prep; right? 8 A Yes. 9 Q That includes when you testify before Congress?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q Do you know someone named Dan Goldman?

12 A I know Dan Goldman; yes, sir. 13 Q Who is Dan Goldman? 14 A Dan Goldman is a member, now, of Congress.

15 Q He's met with you in prep for certain testimony, as 16 well?

17 A Congressional testimony, yes.

18 Q Which Congressional testimony was that? 19 A House Oversight Committee.

20 Q So, that was the one in February of 2019; is that 21 right?

22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q How many times did you meet with him? 24 A I believe, twice.

25 Q You know he's a former Federal Prosecutor; right?

1 Q The prep you're talking about for this trial -- maybe 2 not to the same extent -- but, any time you would testify under 3 oath, you would prep for it; right?

4027 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q During the testimony you gave in February of 2019, 3 that's one of the times when you lied; right? 4 A Yes, sir.

5 Q Now, I'm gonna start, briefly, with the time in 6 October of 2016; okay.

7 So, we're going back to the few weeks leading up to when 8 you put money in and then paid the NDA with Ms. Daniels; okay. 9 So, early October until October 26th; okay.

10 You said last week, correct me if I'm wrong, that there was 11 significant urgency to the Daniels situation at that time; 12 right? 13 A Correct. 14 Q And that issue, the Ms. Daniels issue was taking a lot 15 of your time; right? 16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q And when you spoke with President Trump during that 20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q Whether it was on the phone or in person; right?

22 A Correct. 23 Q But, you'll agree with me, right, that you had a lot 24 going on, both in your personal life and with President Trump, 25 in those first few weeks of October; right?

18 time, you testified last week that many of the times you spoke 19 with him, it was about that issue; right?

4028 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q Do you recall dealing with a meaningful issue with 3 respect to your taxi medallion business and whether you should 4 invest or restructure loans? Do you remember doing that at the 5 time? 6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q You were doing that with Mr. Freidman? He was, 8 possibly, part of that deal?

19 $7 million, that ultimately closed at the end of October of 20 2016? 21 A Yes, sir.

22 As I said, it was a sale. 23 Q And that was with your brother? 24 A Yes, sir.

25 Q Now, you also were working -- you testified last week 9 A No, sir. That's incorrect.

10 Q We'll come back to that. 11 You were also dealing with a loan -- I think it was a 12 loan -- correct me if I'm wrong -- on one of your investment 13 properties that you have with your brother; is that right? 14 A I had an investment property with my brother, but 15 there was no loan. 16 I believe it was a sale.

17 Q Well, do you recall in the October timeframe working 18 on -- working with a lawyer to close a deal that generated 4029 1 about your work for the National Diversity Coalition for 2 President Trump. 3 There was a fair amount of work going on in October with 4 respect to that, as well; right?

5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q Do you recall, right around October 26th and the 7 week before, getting an endorsement from a family member of 8 Dr. King? 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q And that was very important, for sure; right? 11 A It was very important.

12 Q Do you also recall working pretty closely in that time 13 period, early October to October 26th, with Mr. Pecker, but not 14 on anything to do with what you testified about, with a 15 separate litigation involving iPayment? 16 A I do. Yes.

17 Q In that case, a lawyer named Marc Kasowitz was 18 involved; right? 19 A Correct.

20 Q And another lawyer that you knew was involved, as 21 well; right?

22 A (Shakes head). I don't -- 23 Q You don't recall? 24 A No, sir.

25 Q We'll come back to it.

1 What about, do you remember, at that same time period 2 leading right up to the 26th, helping one of President Trump's 3 sons -- daughters, Tiffany Trump, with a potential extortion of 4 photographs; do you remember that?

5 A I do. 6 Q That was leading up -- right up to the 25th and the 7 26th of October; right? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q In connection with that issue, do you remember having 10 a conversation with Mr. Pecker about that? 11 A Yes, sir.

12 Q And a conversation with the General Counsel of AMI 13 about that? 14 A Yes, sir.

15 Q And then, we talked about the issue with the harassing 16 phone calls last week; right.

17 That also happened in that time period, leading up to the 18 26th; right? 19 A Yes, sir.

20 Q So, I started talking about the taxi medallion issue. 21 Do you know somebody named John Lydon? L-Y-D-O-N.

22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q Who is that? 24 A He is a mortgage broker, bond broker out of Florida.

25 Q Was that the person that you were working on a 4030 4031 1 potential deal with in the first few weeks of October of 2016?

2 A Yes, sir. 3 Q What's the name of his company? 4 A Resolution Consultants. 9 Q That was right when you were talking to him about, 10 potentially -- about a deal with respect to some loans around 11 some of the medallions that you had investment in, or they were 12 your medallions? 13 A No, sir. 14 I spoke to Mr. Lydon about I had a mortgage on a property, 15 and I was looking to sell that mortgage to him.

19 piece of real estate --
20 Q Go ahead. 21 A -- in Florida that I had a first-position lien on.

22 Q You're sure that the deal didn't have something to do 23 with the New York City medallion portfolio, an overview of the 24 portfolio as of August 31, 2016?

25 A No.

5 Q So, his Florida entity that he runs his business out 6 of is called the same thing that you called your LLC when you 7 opened it up in early October? 8 A Yes, sir.

16 Q Using Mr. Lydon?

17 A Yes, sir.

18 It didn't have to do with medallions. It had to do with a 4032 1 I believe Mr. Lydon had to do with a mortgage that I had on 2 a piece of real estate in Florida. 3 Q So, if I can show you what's been marked for 14 Q That's Mr. Lydon's wife?

15 A I believe so, yes. 16 Q Do you have any doubt?

17 A I do not.

18 Q So, you see that communication from her, saying, "The 19 New York City medallion portfolio overview as of 8/31," and 20 then there's an attachment, a spreadsheet? 21 A Yes, sir.

22 MR. BLANCHE: We can take that down. 23 Q Do you recall receiving a text a few days later from 24 John, from Kerry's husband, saying that he wanted to talk to 25 you about that over the weekend?

11 his screen.)
12 Q Do you see that text message from someone named Kerry? 13 A I do.

6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 7 the witness and the parties.) 8 MR. BLANCHE: If we can focus on September 28th 9 of 2016.

10 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 4 identification, just for you and for the parties and the Court, 5 B130.

1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q And then you -- we don't have to go through every 3 communication. 4 You had multiple communications around that issue into 5 October; correct? 6 A Correct.

7 Q And you talked to him on the phone about it, as well? 8 A Yes, sir.

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q And then, do you recall your conversations with 20 Mr. Lydon, again, during that time period in early 21 October 2016, he was asking you to find somebody to help invest 22 with you, to find a client who has the funds to invest with 23 you; do you recall that? 24 A Yes, sir.

25 Q And the client was Mr. Freidman; right?

9 Q If we can put up just for you and the parties and the 10 Court B132, which is an October 13th email. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 12 the witness and the parties.) 13 Q Take a look at that, and see if you remember that and 14 that it was a medallion acquisition proposal that you were 15 discussing. 16 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 17 his screen.)
4033 4034 1 A No, sir.

2 Q So, let's take a look, if we can -- well, let's step 3 back for a minute. 4 You were contacting -- communicating with Mr. Freidman 5 regularly during that time, as well; right? 6 A He was the medallion operator for medallions; yes, 7 sir.

10 A Yes. 11 Q If you can now take a look at what's been marked for 12 identification as B133. 13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 14 the witness and the parties.) 17 I highlighted some of those at the top.

18 Those are all medallion loans that were part of your 19 relationship with Mr. Freidman; right?

20 A No, sir. 21 Q No?

22 A No, sir. 23 Q What were they part of? 24 A I don't know.

25 I was never partners with Mr. Freidman.

8 Q So, it's fair to say you were, obviously, 9 communicating with him a lot; is that fair?

15 Q This is part of the deal that you were working on with 16 Mr. Lydon involving Resolution Consultants.

4035 1 Q What do you mean by that?

2 A Mr. Freidman was a licensed New York City medallion 3 agent, and he was running my medallions, both in New York as 4 well as some in Chicago. 8 A No, sir. 9 MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down.

10 Q We can show you B144, which is an October 14th email. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 12 the witness and the parties.) 13 Q Take a look at that. 14 Take your time reading it, and see if that refreshes your 15 recollection about whether Mr. Freidman was part of that deal. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, Judge, just as to 17 characterizing the testimony.

18 THE COURT: Let's see if it refreshes his 19 recollection.

20 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 21 his screen.)
22 A Sir. 23 MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down. 24 Q Does that refresh your recollection about who is the 25 funder that you were interested in getting for that deal?

5 Q So, the spreadsheet that Mr. Lydon sent to you that 6 went to October, that doesn't refresh your recollection whether 7 Mr. Freidman was part of that deal?

4036 1 A No, sir.

2 Q Well, do you recall right after receiving that email, 3 you called Mr. Freidman regularly on that day? 4 A I spoke -- yes, I spoke to Mr. Freidman.

5 Q Now, during that time period, do you recall any issues 6 with Mr. Freidman because of his financial situation?

7 A Because of the entire taxi industry financial 8 situation. 9 Q Well, I'm not -- I'm not talking about the entire 10 industry. 11 I'm asking you whether you were having issues with 12 Mr. Freidman paying you during that time period? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q Checks were bouncing?

15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q You were having a hard time getting checks from him?

17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And there was a ton of communication about that at 19 that time; right?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q Do you recall whether he was also going through 22 something personal during that time? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q What was he going through?

25 A Marital problems.

4037 3 A I tried. 4 Q What did you try to do?

5 A I tried to assist in bringing them back together, as 6 well as talking to him about potential lawyers.

7 Q Did you help him find a place to live? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Was that --
10 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I'm going to object at 11 this point.

12 THE COURT: Please approach. 13 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 14 at sidebar:)
15 MS. HOFFINGER: I understand we're going into 16 some areas that he was busy in October.

17 But, to go into some other person's personal 18 marital issues and whether he assisted him, I don't see 19 how that's relevant.

20 THE COURT: Where are you going with this, 21 Mr. Blanche?

22 MR. BLANCHE: Mr. Cohen, in October, was 23 dealing with a tremendous number of issues, including 24 Mr. Freidman, who, the Court will recall, very quickly 25 after that gets into a lot of legal trouble coming out of 1 Q Did you, in that time period, help him with respect to 2 his marital problems?

4038 1 his financial problems.

2 During this time, there is a series of 3 communications we're about to talk to him about, where 11 MR. BLANCHE: Because he, eventually, cooperates 12 and testifies against him in the Southern District of New 13 York. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: So what?

15 Are you suggesting Mr. Cohen can't do more than 16 one thing at a time as a lawyer for a company?

17 THE COURT: Keep it to three more questions about 18 him being busy. 19 MR. BLANCHE: All right.

20 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 21 in open court:)

7 A I did.

11 A Yes, sir.

17 the -- you needed to find an LLC for the Karen McDougal payment 18 and for all of the materials that AMI had on President Trump, 21 A No, sir.

22 Q Now, I want to talk for a few minutes about the 23 iPayments litigation. 24 What do you recall about that litigation?

25 A I don't recall the specifics of it.

8 Q And is that all during that same time period, meaning 9 the first few weeks of October, meaning around and up until 10 October 26th and maybe a little bit after; right?

12 Q Did you have -- the Resolution Consultants deal that 13 you were working on, did that deal ever close? 14 A No, sir.

15 Q So, when you opened Resolution Consultants in early 16 October, your testimony is that you opened this because of 19 the company wasn't because you were considering doing this deal 20 with the Resolution Consultants in Florida?

1 Q Do you remember an individual named Michael Sirota?

4040 2 A Sirota. 3 Q Sirota. 4 Who is Mr. Sirota?

5 A Mr. Sirota is a partner over at a law firm called 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q And that litigation was filed the very last day of 11 September 2016; correct?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And do you remember what that litigation was about? 14 A Again, I do not.

15 Q Do you remember whether another colleague of yours 16 named Marc Kasowitz represented the other side of that 17 litigation?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q And that was when, at least for part of that time, you 20 were in London, visiting your daughter and celebrating your 21 anniversary; correct?

22 A Correct. 23 Q And you recall having communications with Mr. Sirota, 24 at that point when you were in London, about this litigation?

25 A Yes, sir.

7 Q Do you recall him being Mr. Pecker's attorney in 8 connection with this litigation?

6 Cole Schotz.

4041 1 Q Ultimately, you tried to play a role in settling that 2 litigation; right? 3 A Yes, sir. 4 Q And one of the reasons you did that is because of your 5 friendship with Mr. Pecker? 6 A Yes, sir. 7 Q Is one of the reasons you did that because of 8 your relationship with Mr. Sirota and your relationship with 9 Mr. Kasowitz?

10 A They are all friends, yes, sir. 11 Q They are all friends of yours? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And you communicated to them about that in October; 14 right? 15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q Do you -- but you also were at least exploring the idea 17 of getting a job at iPayments; correct?

18 A It was floated, yes, sir. 19 Q And that was -- when you say "it was floated" -- during 20 that time period it was floated; right? 21 A Yes, sir. 22 Q So, all of this was within the few weeks during that 23 time around October 26th? 24 A Yes, sir. 25 Q Now -- and we talked about this for a few minutes at 4042 1 the beginning of your testimony today, but you worked with an 2 individual named Pastor Darrell Scott on the National Diversity 3 Coalition; right? 4 A That's correct. 5 Q And, at the time, I believe you testified last Tuesday, 6 this was a pretty big, big deal for you and for the campaign; 7 right? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q And the week of October 26th, in fact, on October 25th, 10 you were sent a video link about Dr. King's niece's support for 11 President Trump; right? 12 Do you remember that? 13 A I do. 14 Q And the niece is a doctor herself; right? 15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q So, this was a big deal for you; right? 17 A It was a big deal for everyone.

18 Q So, including you? 19 A Yes, sir. 20 Q And on October 26th, you -- so, that's the day that you 21 caused the -- that the payment was made to Ms. Daniels' 22 attorney; right? 23 A Correct. 24 Q You talked on multiple times that day with folks 25 associated with Dr. King's statement and the fact that she was 4043 1 now going to be supporting President Trump; right?

2 A That's correct. 3 Q She actually participated in an event later on that 5 A I do. 6 Q Do you recall you and Pastor Scott trying to 7 immediately put her on the Board or whatever leadership position 8 you all had at the time; is that right? 9 A That's correct.

10 Q And all that was happening the week of the 24th, 25th 11 and 26th; right? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And then, I mentioned this earlier with President 14 Trump's daughter, do you recall on October 25th -- so, the day 15 before -- do you recall her communicating with you that she had 16 concerns about somebody trying to blackmail her? 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And do you recall that you handled it immediately? 19 A Yes, sir. 20 Q You spoke with Mr. Pecker? 21 A Yes. 22 Q You spoke with the -- with, obviously, with Miss Trump 23 about it -- with Tiffany Trump about it; correct? 24 A Yes.

25 Q And you then, later, spoke with the General Counsel at
4 week; do you recall that?

4044 1 AMI; correct?

2 A Correct. 3 Q And that was all to figure out a way to shut this down; 4 right?

5 A Correct.
6 Q And that all happened in the afternoon and evening of 7 October 25th; correct? 8 A Correct. 9 Q Are you sure about that?

10 I could show you documents. 11 A No, I believe it's correct. 12 Q So, do you remember -- now I'm talking about the 26th, 13 the day this all happened. You testified on direct that you had 14 two phone calls with President Trump that morning, at 8:26 and 15 at 8:34. 16 The 8:26 call was three minutes and one second; the 8:34 17 call was one minute and twenty-eight seconds.

18 Do you remember talking about that? 19 A I do. 20 Q Correct? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Now, you testified on direct that the reason why you 23 wanted to speak with President Trump on that day was to make 24 sure that he approved of what you were doing, you needed his 25 approval for this, and that was the sum and substance of the 1 conversation.

2 You wanted the deal -- you wanted Ms. Daniels to not be 3 able to sell her story to The Daily Mail, and you were about to 7 Q And that's still your testimony today? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Now, do you remember what was happening in the 10 campaign, what President Trump was doing on October 26th? 11 A Sir, I don't understand your question.

12 Q Well, do you have a recollection of what President 13 Trump was doing on the 26th in connection with his campaign; 14 rallies, interviews or anything else?

15 A He was doing rallies basically every day. 16 Q All right.

17 But, do you have a specific recollection of what he was 18 doing on that day? 19 A No, sir.

20 Q So, let me show you what has been marked for 21 identification, just for you, the Court and the parties, B168.

22 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 23 Q And I don't know that you've ever seen this before, so 24 I'm not showing it to you like you have.

25 I'm just showing it to you to see if it refreshes your 4045 4 go across the street and do it, so you wanted his blessing; 5 right? 6 A That's correct.

4046 1 recollection.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Q Well, do you remember that morning, okay, so the 5 morning of the 26th, that President Trump was going to sit down 6 and do an interview with ABC News right after 9:00? 7 Does that ring a bell? 8 A No, sir. 9 Q Does it ring a bell, though, if I reminded you that it 10 wasn't just President Trump, it was going to be his entire 11 family that was sitting down with Mr. Stephanopoulos, so not 21 A I am. 22 Q Do you recall, for a time period, President Trump owned 23 that; right? 24 A Yes, sir.

25 Q Do you recall October 26th being the day that there was
14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: Sustained. 16 Q That doesn't ring a bell, Mr. Cohen? 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. The objection is sustained. 19 Q Do you recall -- are you familiar with the Post Office 20 Building in Washington, D.C.?

12 just President Trump, but also his children and Melania Trump as 13 well?

4047 1 an opening ceremony for that?

2 Do you remember that? 3 A No, sir. 4 Q So, but you do have a specific recollection, it sounds 5 like, that on those two phone calls, you just talked about the 6 Stormy Daniels deal; that's it? 7 A Because they were important to me. 8 Q So was fixing Tiffany Trump's situation important to 9 you?

10 A It was important that I take care of it, but it was not 11 personally important to me. 12 Q But that wouldn't have been something you updated her 13 father about when you spoke with him the next morning? 14 A No, sir. 15 Q No? You wouldn't have updated him about any -- well, 16 let me ask you this: At the time, that was right around the 17 time that there was still fallout from the Access Hollywood 18 tape; correct? 19 A Correct. 20 Q So, if there was going to be meetings and interviews 21 that day, you don't think you would have spoken with President 22 Trump about anything involving that issue, just about Stormy 23 Daniels? 24 A My recollection is that I was speaking to him about 25 Stormy Daniels because that was what he tasked me to take care 4048 1 of and that's what I had been working on.

2 Q Do you recall ever speaking with President Trump about 3 the fact that he was opening a hotel in the old Post Office in 4 Washington, D.C.?

5 A Yes, we've had conversations about that. 6 Q Even before it was opened; right?

7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q But you wouldn't have talked to him about that on that 9 day?

10 A No, sir. 11 Q Just about the Daniels situation?

12 A As I recall, yes. 13 Q Now, I want to talk for a few minutes now about 14 the Retainer Agreement -- the meeting that you had with 15 Mr. Weisselberg in January 2017 and you talked about -- you met 16 with him, you brought the statement that showed that you had 17 transferred $131,000, and then there is writing from you and 18 there is writing from Mr. Weisselberg; correct? 19 Do you know what I'm talking about?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q And I believe your testimony is that the way that the 22 $35,000 a month -- the way that that number was kind of 23 developed was $130,000 for the payment to Ms. Daniels; right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q $50,000 from the Red Finch polling situation?

1 A Yes, sir.

4049 2 Q That's 180; right?

3 A Correct.
4 Q And then your testimony is that Mr. Weisselberg said, 5 "Let's gross that up and double it," which brings you to 360? 6 A That's correct. 7 Q And then Mr. Weisselberg said that you are getting 8 another $60,000 bonus?

10 Q And that adds up to 420 or 35,000 a month; right? 11 A Correct. 12 Q But you were shorted a hundred thousand on your bonus 14 A Correct. 15 Q So, for many years you had gotten 150,000, and in 2016 16 you got 50; right? 17 A That's correct.

18 Q So, the 50,000 that you got back from Red Finch, you -- 19 well, you only paid the Red Finch owner 20,000; right? 20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q So, you were getting some -- he was a friend of yours 22 or you knew him; is that right? 23 A I knew him. 24 Q And he was giving you a hard time because he hadn't 25 been paid and The Trump Organization wasn't going to pay him; 13 that year; right?

9 A Yes, sir.

4050 1 right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q And so, you went to a bank and cashed two checks for 4 him; is that right? 5 A No, sir. 6 Q Well, how did you pay him the $20,000? 7 A I went across the street from my home to TD Bank, and I 8 just took out cash over a couple of days. 9 Q So you went and withdrew cash.

11 A I just didn't want to take it out, the $20,000. 12 Q What were the increments that you took it out in? 13 A I don't recall, sir. 14 Q But, at some point, after a couple of days, you have 15 20,000 in cash, and you meet up with him. 16 Where? 17 A He came to the office.

18 Q And you had, what, like a duffel bag of cash? Like, 19 where was the cash? 20 A No, sir, it was in a small bag. 21 Q What kind of bag? 22 A A small brown paper bag. 23 Q A brown paper bag? 24 A Yes. 25 Q So, you had 20,000 in a brown paper bag; you met 10 Why did you do it over a couple of days?

4051 1 with him, and you gave him $20,000 to take care of that $50,000 2 bill? 3 A Yes. 4 I don't recall if it was exactly 20,000, but he came to the 5 office and I gave him the cash. 6 Q And when was that in relation to the meeting that you 7 had with Mr. Weisselberg in January of 2017? 8 A Substantially before. 9 Q "Substantially," like a year?

10 A Ummm, yes, sir. 11 Q More than a year?

12 A It could have been a couple of months more. 13 Q Okay. 14 So, at some point in late 2015 or early 2016 that happened?

15 A I believe so. 16 Q So, you paid him back his 20,000, and you were square 17 with him; right?

18 A He would have liked the additional 30,000 as well. 19 Q Well, we -- fair enough.

20 But, you said before, in meetings with prosecutors, that 21 that ended that dispute, that ended that issue with him; right?

22 A Between us, yes. 23 Q Well, who else would it have been between? 24 A Mr. Trump and Red Finch.

25 Q So did -- are you aware of Mr. Trump and Red Finch 4052 1 having ongoing litigation or issues after you gave him $20,000?

2 A No, sir. 3 Q Because you were the connect; right? 4 A I was, yes. 5 Q And it was your friend that owned the company? 6 A Again, someone who I knew, yes. 7 Q It's all right,. 8 I'm sorry. I'm calling him a friend. 9 Someone you know owned the company.

10 And so, you knew when you gave him $20,000, that was the end 11 of it; right? 12 A No, sir. He still wanted the full amount, but this was 13 enough to placate him for the time being -- I still needed his 14 service and I still needed his availability, so I accepted the 15 request, which was to give him at least certain monies that he 16 was out-of-pocket on. 17 Q And then Mr. Weisselberg says: Okay, what do we owe 18 you? 19 You say: 50,000 for Red Finch. 20 And Mr. Weisselberg says: Let's gross that up, and makes 21 that 100,000; right? 22 A That's correct. 23 Q So, at what point did you give -- well, let me ask it a 24 different way. 25 You never gave the $30,000 that was owed to the guy that 4053 1 owned Red Finch; did you?

2 A No. No, sir. 3 Q So you stole from The Trump Organization; right? 4 A Yes, sir.

5 Q And you didn't just steal the $30,000, right, it was 6 actually, because it was grossed up, it was $60,000?

8 Q Meaning, if you had been honest with Mr. Weisselberg 9 and said, "I'm only owed 20,000," and he grossed that up, that 10 would have been 40, not a hundred; correct? 11 A Correct.

12 Q And you told multiple prosecutors in the District 13 Attorney's Office that story; right? 14 A Yes, sir.

15 Q Did you ever have to plead guilty to larceny? 16 A No, sir.

17 Q Have you paid back The Trump Organization the money 18 that you stole from them? 19 A No, sir.

20 Q And, by the way, you were in communication with 21 Mr. Weisselberg, coming up with a plan to cover up the $130,000 22 payment; right? That's your testimony? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q And in the middle of that conversation, you lie to him 25 about how much money you are owed from the Red Finch 7 A Yes, sir.

4054 1 transaction?

2 A The transaction with Red Finch had gone on, as I 3 stated, for a long time prior. 4 He knew of the $50,000 that was owed to Red Finch. 5 And when we were sitting down and making the calculations, 6 that's when he asked me: It's 50,000 for Red Finch? 7 And I said: Yes. 8 Q You didn't just say, "Yes;" you actually wrote "50,000" 9 on that sheet of paper; right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q So, my question before you gave us that answer was -- 12 was a very simple question: 13 In the middle of this conversation that you are having with 14 Mr. Weisselberg and you are figuring out when to -- how to cover 15 up this $130,000 payment, right, you lied to him about how much 17 A Correct.

18 Q And to this day, you've never fixed that; right? 19 A No, sir. 20 Q And you've talked about that incident on multiple 21 occasions with the District Attorney? 22 A I have. 23 Q And, moreover, when you had testified last week, on 24 Tuesday, about what you just said, you didn't say you stole from 25 The Trump Organization; did you?

16 you owed, you need reimbursement for Red Finch?

4055 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

2 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 correct? 3 Q But you did steal from The Trump Organization; 7 A I'm sorry? 8 Q You did steal from The Trump Organization based upon 9 the expected reimbursement from Red Finch; correct?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q Now, I want to understand that meeting a little better. 12 Your testimony is that you have a conversations with 13 Mr. Weisselberg? 14 A (No response.) 15 Q That you are going to come up with -- you are going to 16 gross this up, add $60,000, to get you to $420; right? 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And then, at the time you think, I'm going to get paid 19 at one time, but you shortly thereafter learn that it's going to 20 be 12 payments of $35,000; right? 21 A Correct. 22 Q And you are told by -- well, by Mr. Weisselberg just to 23 call it a retainer? 24 A That's correct.

25 Q And you are told: Just send in an invoice, and we will
5 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Overruled.

4056 1 get you paid; right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q We will send it monthly? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q But, your testimony, I think -- correct me if I'm 6 wrong -- is that there was never an expectation that there would 9 Q And, by the way, you had never had a Retainer Agreement 10 when you worked for Trump Org; right? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q We went over this last week. 13 But, you never had one with the personal work you were doing 14 for President Trump; right? 15 A Correct. 16 Q You never had one for any of the work that you were 17 doing for any of his children; right?

18 A Correct. 19 Q And the clear deal between you and Mr. Weisselberg was 20 that you weren't going to have one going forward; right? 21 A This was for reimbursement; correct. 22 Q Right. Correct. 23 Because if you weren't going to be paid for being his 24 lawyer, this was just some big coverup, some big reimbursement 25 for the $130,000; right?

7 be a Retainer Agreement; right? 8 A Correct.

4057 1 A Correct.

7 Mr. Weisselberg about your role as President Trump's Personal 8 Attorney? 9 A No, sir.

10 Q So, the conversations you had with Mr. Weisselberg 11 about the Retainer Agreement and that there would be no Retainer 12 Agreement were all in that meeting? 13 That meeting -- I'm sorry, that was a terrible question. 14 So, the conversations that you had with Mr. Weisselberg 15 about the Retainer Agreement and the fact that there would not 16 be one all took place in the meeting you had with him alone and 17 the meeting you had with President Trump; is that your 18 testimony? 19 A Yes, sir. 20 Q And, now, if you would have had a Retainer Agreement, 21 that Agreement would have been between you and your client; 22 right?

23 A Correct.
24 Q And who would your client have been? 25 A It would have been Mr. Trump.

2 Q I want to show you -- let me ask you this. Except for 3 that one conversation with Mr. Weisselberg about that, and then 4 you guys go in and talk to President Trump about it, supposedly, 5 right, do you remember that, except for those two conversations, 6 did you have other conversations before that with 4058 3 correct?

1 Q So, you -- there was never going to be a scenario where 2 you were going to have a Retainer Agreement with the Trump Org; 4 A Correct. 5 Q Or with Mr. Weisselberg? 6 A Correct. 7 Q Or even with The Trust; right? 8 A Well, it couldn't have been with The Trust. 9 Q Well, don't you recall during that time that there was 10 a separation between President Trump and the Trump Org because 11 he was going to be President? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And the way that that was dealt with was the Trump Org 14 and all of the assets got put into a Trust? 16 Q And that was to separate President Trump being 17 President and his company; that was going to be run by his sons; 18 correct? 19 A And Mr. Weisselberg, yes. 20 Q So, his company -- the President was President, and 22 correct? 21 his sons and Mr. Weisselberg were going to run the company; 23 A Correct. 24 Q So, your personal relationship, your Private Attorney 25 to President Trump relationship wasn't going to be with you and 15 A Yes, sir.

4059 1 The Trust; it would be with you and President Trump; right?

2 A Yes, but The Trust controlled his cash flow, so I would 5 Q I'm sorry,. 6 I didn't ask you where the funds would come from,. 7 I'm saying your attorney-client relationship, your Retainer 8 Agreement, that would have just been between you and President 9 Trump?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q That was my only question. 12 A Understood. 13 Q The payment could have come from, as it often does, 14 from other sources? 15 A Correct. 16 Q But, the attorney-client relationship and the Retainer 17 Agreement is between you and President Trump; right?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q But, that's not what happened here, right, because you 20 and Mr. Weisselberg decided that there would be no Retainer 21 Agreement; right? 22 A Hmmm. Can you rephrase the question? 23 Q I will withdraw the question. 25 Exhibit D260 just for you, the parties and the Court.

3 suspect that somewhere along the line, maybe that's where the 4 funds would come from, I didn't know the answer.

24 I'm going to show you what has been marked as Defense 4060 1 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.)
2 Q And take a look and see if you see your email, 3 Mr. Weisselberg's email, and then the date of that, January 4 31st, 2017. 5 Do you see that? 6 A I do. 7 Q And that's your email. You can only see part of it, 8 but that looks like your email; correct? 9 A Correct.

10 Q I mean, if you take a look at the lower chain with 11 someone named Nelson Ornelas. 12 And you are forwarding that -- that rings true, that this is 13 an email that you forwarded Mr. Weisselberg? 14 A Yes, sir. 15 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B260, your Honor. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 17 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

18 (So marked in evidence.) 19 ********* 20 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put that up on the screen 21 for everybody. 22 And then if we can blow up, first, when it was 23 sent. So, just the first page, the header. 25 MR. BLANCHE: No. Not that. 24 (Displayed.)

5 Correct? 6 A That's correct.

7 Q So, by this time, you had had your meeting with him 8 about how this coverup payment would work; right? 9 A Correct.

10 Q You had already started your role as President Trump's 11 Personal Attorney?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And this is basically your last day at Trump Org. or 14 maybe right around this time was your last day at Trump Org; 15 right? 16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q Okay.

18 And you are forwarding an email -- I'm sorry. 19 Allen is responding to an email that you sent him, 20 Mr. Weisselberg, at 6:07 at night; right? 21 A He is sending me an email, yes.

22 Q Responding to an email that you send him lower down; 23 right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q Okay.

4062 1 MR. BLANCHE: Can we look at the first two lines 2 of the actual text of that email? 3 (Displayed.) 4 Q Can you go ahead and read that out to the jury, please? 5 A "Thank you. You never stopped in for a bro hug. 6 Anyway, please prepare the Agreement we discussed so we can pay 7 you monthly." 8 MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down. 9 Q Why would you have had to prepare an Agreement so that 10 you could get paid monthly if, as you said last week, you -- and 16 But you just testified four minutes ago, and then you 17 testified last Tuesday, that you and Mr. Weisselberg had a deal 18 that there would never be an Agreement because it was all a 19 coverup; right? 20 That was your testimony last week, and that was your 21 testimony a few minutes ago; yes? 22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q All right. 24 MR. BLANCHE: So, can we put up People's Exhibit 1, 25 please.

11 again a few minutes ago, there was never an expectation that you 12 were going to have an Agreement? 13 A It was in order to get the reimbursement of the $35,000 14 per month back. 15 Q Oh, I understand that.

4063 4 (Displayed.)

2 A Because they were the Trustees of The Trust. 7 A I'm sorry, your question is confusing. 8 Q A few minutes ago when you talked about how your 9 retainer would be with President Trump, but a third source may 10 provide payment; correct? 11 A Correct. 12 Q And for the first three months, that's exactly what 13 happened here; right? 14 The Trust paid you, it didn't come out of President Trump's 15 personal funds; right? 16 A Correct. 17 Q And then the remaining nine months the checks were 18 signed from President Trump's personal account; right? 19 A Correct. 22 A Correct. 23 Q And as that email just indicated, not surprising to 24 you, it would have been approved by Eric and Don; right? 25 A Either Eric or Don, in association with Allen 20 Q But the first two checks for the first three months 21 were signed by representatives from The Trust; right?

6 personal account; right? 3 Q So, that was what you were talking about a few minutes 4 ago, right, where you -- there could be a payment plan where the 5 money comes from The Trust as opposed to President Trump's 4065 1 Weisselberg.

2 Q So, is it fair to say that once you became President 3 Trump's personal attorney in 2017, every single email you sent, 4 your signature block said the same thing; fair? 5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q Every time you sent an email, whether it was to a 7 potential client; right? 9 Q Whether it was to a friend?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q Whether it was to the Trump Org. sending an invoice, it 12 always said Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump; 13 right? 14 A Yes, sir. 15 Q And, by the way, that's the same job you had had for a 16 decade; right? 17 A Yes, except not to the President, CEO of the Trump 18 Organization as Special Counsel, but now it was Personal 19 Attorney to the President of the United States. 20 Q But what I mean is, his job changed, meaning President 21 Trump's job changed, your job didn't; right? 22 A Correct. 23 Q So -- and, again, at that time in 2017, as you were 24 rolling out to be Personal Attorney for President Donald J. 25 Trump, you told everybody that that was happening; correct?

8 A Correct.

4066 1 A Not everybody, but I certainly was proud of the role, 2 and I announced it. 3 Q You told TMZ? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q You told the New York Times? 6 A Yes, sir. 7 Q You actually gave them a little scoop on it; is that 8 fair? 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q And as to that fact, you went on TV and you told 11 Sean Hannity about it? 12 You announced it; right? 13 A I did. 14 Q And what you said, repeatedly, at the time, was that 15 you were going to remain in the same role you always had, right, 16 which is, you were going to be the Personal Attorney to the 17 President of the United States; right?

18 A Correct. 19 Q And that's what you did; right? 20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q So, I want to show you and the parties and the Court, 22 B261. 23 And I'm going to ask you if you see that email and, if so, 24 do you recognize it? 25 (Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.)
4067 1 (Pause while witness reads the document.)
2 Q Do you recognize that email? 3 A I do, sir. 4 Q Is that your good-bye email to the Trump Organization?

5 A It was.

16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q It went to everybody at The Trump Organization; 18 correct? 19 A Correct.

20 Q And, here, you again tell everybody at The Trump 21 Organization that you are starting a new job to be President 22 Trump's Personal Attorney; right? 23 A Correct. 24 Q If you look at the third paragraph, the paragraph that 25 starts: "I will be in and out of the Office."
6 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B261.

7 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 8 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 9 (So marked in evidence.)
10 ********* 11 MR. BLANCHE: We are going to display that for 12 everybody. 13 Q We are not going to read the email, but this is the 14 email that you sent on January 27th, 2017; right?

15 (Displayed.)
4068 1 MR. BLANCHE: If we can blow that paragraph up.

2 (Displayed.)
6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q And you say what an honor it was. And you agree with 8 that; right? 9 A I do.

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q But then you say you are going to miss everybody? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And then give them a way to contact you; correct? 16 A Correct.

17 MR. BLANCHE: And we can take that down.

18 Q And then you started doing legal work for President 19 Trump; right?

20 A Excuse me? 21 Q Well, once you -- you changed roles, so you leave The 22 Trump Organization and you start as President Trump's Personal 23 Attorney, you continue to do what you were doing in January, in 24 February of 2017, right, helping President Trump with his 25 personal legal issues; right?

10 Q And that you are going to be -- have productive and 11 exciting times with President Trump; right?

5 President Donald J. Trump." Correct?

3 Q And you write: "It is for this reason that I am truly 4 excited to begin my new position as Personal Attorney to 4069 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q You had a matter with Marc Kasowitz representing 3 President Trump; right? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q You were -- you and he were actually lead counsel on 6 that case; right? 7 A I think Marc Kasowitz was lead counsel. 8 Q Well, let's take a look at B176 just for you, the Court 9 and the parties.

10 MR. BLANCHE: And then we can go to the next 11 page. 12 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 13 MR. BLANCHE: Actually, let's go to Page 15. I'm 14 sorry. 15 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 16 Q Take a look at Page 15, and, actually, the bottom.

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q So, isn't it true, that both you and Mr. Kasowitz were 20 both lead counsel on that matter? 21 A Yes, sir. 24 Mr. Kasowitz's time; right? 25 A Yes.

17 Hold on one second.

22 Q And that was, at the time, a relatively active matter 23 that was taking a fair amount of your time, and it looks like 4070 1 Q Now, do you recall discussions with --
2 MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down. 3 Q Do you recall in discussions with the people that were 4 working at the White House, like Hope Hicks, working with you 5 to find a lawyer to represent President Trump in certain 6 matters? 7 A I'm sorry. 8 Can you ask that again. 9 Q Well, is -- so one of the things that you did as 10 President Trump's attorney was to help him find a lawyer to 11 actually work the case; right? 12 A One? 13 Q One of the things? 14 A Yes. 15 Q So, in the case that we just talked about with 16 Mr. Kasowitz, you were co-lead counsel with him; right? 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q But, in some other cases you maybe wouldn't have 19 handled the case yourself if it wasn't your area of expertise, 20 but you would represent President Trump in getting a lawyer to 21 help him; right? 22 A Correct. 23 Q And do you recall doing that in January and February of 24 2017 for President Trump? 25 A Yes.

4071 1 Q For example, there were issues at the time with 2 reporters potentially making defamatory statements against 3 President Trump; right? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q And you helped -- that was part of your job, right, to 6 help with that? 7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q And you have met regularly with counsel, including 9 Mr. Kasowitz, in February as well, on not only the case you were 10 lead counsel on, but some other matters as well; right? 11 A Yes, sir. 12 Q And there was -- I mean, just so the jury understands, 13 and to help us understand, that was a case that actually had 14 legal filings that had to be made; right? 15 A Yes. 16 Q So it wasn't just, like a threat of litigation, there 17 was ongoing litigation with legal filings; right?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q And you were part of that? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Your role changed, is that fair; is that what you 22 said? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Okay. So, certainly, talking about January and 25 February, you were actively a part of that; correct?

4072 1 A Yes.

2 Q And then the filings in March, you helped with the
3 filings; correct? 4 A I reviewed the documents, yes. 5 Q Well, is reviewing the documents helping with the 6 filings? 7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q All right. Do you recall helping President Trump even 9 serving subpoenas on Government agencies, like helping figure 10 out how to serve a subpoena on a State Department? 11 Do you recall helping with that?

12 A No, sir.
13 Q Well, let's take a look at B237 and just review that, 14 for the parties and the Court. 15 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 16 MR. BLANCHE: If we can just blow up the text so 17 that Mr. Cohen can see it a little bit easier.

18 Thank you. 19 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 20 MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down. 21 Q So do you recall working with Mr. Kasowitz around 22 subpoenas that had been issued, including the State Department? 23 A I received the email from them, yes. 24 Q Well, when you received an email like that and you were 25 President Trump's attorney, would you have known something about 4073 1 it?

2 A Yes. 3 Q So, that was just my question, whether that was one of 4 the things that you were doing at that time, was helping 5 President Trump with that type of issue? 6 A Yes, sir. 7 Q Now, in May of 2017, a Special Counsel was appointed 8 named Robert Mueller; right? 9 A Correct.

10 Q What, if anything, did that -- what, if any, effect did 11 that have on your attorney-client relationship with Mr. Trump, 12 if anything? 13 A It did not. 14 Q So, at some point, though, later in the year, did the 15 fact that there was a Special Counsel investigating President 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And that's because there were false claims made by 19 you? 20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q Now, President Trump appointed or named Mr. Kasowitz, 22 at least initially, to be his lawyer for that; right?

23 A Correct.
24 Q And you were part of that process; right? 25 A (Witness indicating with a quizzical look.)
16 Trump affect your relationship with President Trump?

4074 1 Q Well, you were -- the process of selecting 2 Mr. Kasowitz, did you play a role in that? 3 A No, sir. 4 Q How did you find out about it? 5 A I don't recall. 6 Q Were you happy, sad or indifferent, that Mr. Kasowitz 7 had been appointed as President Trump's Personal Attorney for 8 that?

10 Q Because you had a good relationship with him? 11 A Yes, sir. 12 Q And did you continue to work with Mr. Kasowitz in his 13 representation of President Trump in connection with the Mueller 14 investigation? 15 A Not that I recall. 16 Q So that was a separation; right? 17 So you were aware that Mr. Kasowitz was selected.

18 Mr. Kasowitz was representing President Trump and you weren't 19 really a part of that; right? 20 A No, I was not. 21 Q But you were still Special Counsel -- Personal Counsel 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q You also did a fair amount of work for -- legal work 25 for the First Lady in 2017; correct?

9 A Probably happy.

22 to President Trump; correct?

1 A I did legal work for the First Lady.
4075

2 Q There was an issue with Madame Tussauds; correct?
3 A Yes. 4 Q And you helped with that?

5 A I reviewed the Agreement, yes. 6 Q And reviewing the Agreement is helping with that?

7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q You also met with the First Lady on many occasions, at 17 A No, sir.

18 Q Well, was the Madame Tussauds a legal issue? 19 A That was.

20 Q Was there a -- do you recall there being a trademark 21 issue that arose involving Melania during that time period?

22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q And did you help with that situation? 24 A I did.

25 Q And, again, that's legal work you were performing for 9 least in February and March and April of that year; right?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q Did you meet with the First Lady in New York?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q Because she was still in New York at that time? 14 A Yes, sir.

15 Q And part of your role in meeting with her was helping 16 her with legal issues or potential legal issues; correct?

4076 1 the First Lady; right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q But you separately met with her on multiple occasions 4 for non-legal work as well; right?

5 A Personal matters. 6 Q And did you view that as part of your job?

7 A Yes, sir.

15 Q Well, that's what you did; right? 16 A That's what I did, yes.

17 Q And your job was being President Trump's lawyer; 18 correct? 19 A Yes, sir.

20 Q So, at some point, and we talked about this a little 21 bit on Thursday, but at some point were you advised that you 22 shouldn't have contact with President Trump because of the 23 Mueller investigation? 24 A Not that I recall.

25 Q So you don't recall being -- saying to the President 8 Q So, part of your job had always been or at least for 9 many years had been not only doing legal work, but helping 10 President Trump and his family with an array of issues; right? 11 A Correct.

12 Q And that's what a lot of lawyers do; right? 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 14 THE COURT: Sustained.

4077 1 that you were advised that you could not speak to President 2 Trump in and around May of that year? 3 A I don't recall that, no, sir. 4 Q And, to be clear, the Retainer Agreement that you 5 entered into with Mr. Weisselberg and -- 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 Q The Retainer Agreement that you discussed with 9 Mr. Weisselberg, okay, that led to you being paid $35,000 a 10 month in 2017; correct?

13 Q Well, how much were you paid every month in 2017 from 14 President Trump personally?

15 A That would have been nine checks. 16 Q Nine checks --
17 A At $35,000 a piece.

18 Q And the other three checks came from The Trust -- 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

20 THE COURT: Sustained. 21 I'm sorry, can you ask that again?

22 Q The other three checks came from The Trust; correct? 23 THE COURT: You can answer.

11 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

12 THE COURT: Sustained.

24 THE WITNESS: I can answer?

25 THE COURT: You can answer if you know the answer.

4078 1 A Yes.

2 Q So the first check was for $70,000, which was for two 3 months; right? 4 A Yes, sir.

5 Q And then the second check from The Trust was for March 12 Q And that was the Agreement that was struck; correct? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q You also did a ton of consulting work in 2017; right?

15 A I did consulting work, yes. 16 Q Well, did you do a little bit of it or a lot of it?

17 A I don't know how to define a little or a lot. I had 18 consulting clients, yes. 19 Q How many?

20 A Six in total. 21 Q How much were you paid in 2017?

22 A Approximately $4 million. 23 Q From those six clients? 24 A Yes, sir.

1 clients?

2 A Yes, sir. 3 Q You signed with them in January of 2017; does that 5 A I don't recall if it was January of 2017. 6 Q No problem. 7 MR. BLANCHE: Can we show the witness what has been 8 marked for identification as B188 just for the witness, the 9 parties and the Court.

10 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 11 ********** 12 Q Take a look at that, and then we can discuss it. 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q Does that refresh your recollection that it was 16 A It does. 17 MR. BLANCHE: We can take that down.

18 Q And they paid you $50,000 a month? 19 A Correct. 20 Q For how long? 21 A For one year. 22 Q So 12 months, $50,000 a month; right? 23 A Correct. 24 Q What work did you do for AT&T? 25 A Consulting and advisory work.

4080 1 Q So what does that mean? What actual work did you do 2 for them? 5 Q What time period of the year was this? 6 A (Witness indicating.) 7 Q What time period? 8 So you signed with them in January. At what point are you 9 advising them on this?

10 A Throughout that year. 11 Q Approximately how many communications did you have with 13 A Approximately 20. 14 Q And were those communications of all sort, meaning 15 email, phone calls, and in-person meetings? 16 A Yes, sir. 17 Q So over the course of 12 months, you had 20 18 communications with AT&T, and they paid you $600,000; right? 19 A Yes, sir. 20 Q And there's nothing wrong with that; correct? 21 A I don't see it. 22 Q I'm not saying there are, I'm just asking you? 23 A I don't believe so. 24 Q And who -- what is Columbus Nova? 25 A Columbus Nova is a fund; that was also a client.

3 A I advised them on the issue that was taking place where 4 they wanted to acquire, I believe, it was Time Warner.

12 them during the year?

4081 1 Q When did you sign with Columbus Nova?

2 A I believe in February of 2017. 3 Q Let's take a look at B18O -- well, could it have been 4 January? 5 A It could have been January as well. 6 Q January 25th, 2017; right? 7 A Sounds correct. 8 Q And they paid you $80,000 a month; right? 9 A Correct.

10 Q How long did you work for Columbus Nova? 11 A The Agreement was supposed to be for one year. 12 Q Well, "supposed to be," it sounds like it was -- was it 13 longer or shorter? 14 A Shorter. 15 Q How long did they end up cutting the Agreement? 16 A Well, it was a little more than six months, I believe. 17 Q How many communications did you have with them over 18 that six-month period of time? 19 A More than a hundred. 20 Q And those hundred communications were of all sorts, 21 email, phone calls, in-person meetings? 22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q Why did that relationship come to a halt? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 25 THE COURT: Sustained.

4082 1 Q Well, let me ask you this: There is nothing wrong with 2 you and/or another party signing an agreement and then saying, 4 A That's correct. 5 Q By the way, you never told President Trump that you 6 had -- and we are going to go through some more that you had -- 7 had all these consulting arrangements; did you? 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 9 THE COURT: Overruled.

10 You can answer. 11 A In fact, it was Mr. Trump who introduced the CEO of 12 AT&T to me, that's how I ended up obtaining him as a client. 13 Q So, let me ask that question again. I didn't ask you 14 who introduced you to your clients. 15 My question was whether along the way you told President 16 Trump that you had all these -- that you had six consulting 17 Agreements --
18 A I did not specifically tell President Trump that, no. 19 Q And -- well, you know at some point he found out; 20 right? 21 A I believe so, yes. 22 Q And you know that he was frustrated that you had signed 23 a deal with AT&T; correct? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 25 THE COURT: Sustained.

3 we are not going to work together anymore; right?

4083 1 Q What about Novartis?

2 Did you have a relationship with Novartis? 3 A I did. 4 Q They hired you in March of 2017; correct? 5 A Correct. 6 Q And they paid you $100,000 a month; correct? 7 A Correct. 8 Q And that was a one-year deal? 9 A Correct.

10 Q So, you were paid 1.2 million by Novartis? 11 A Correct. 12 Q And you testified in front of Congress that you had six 14 A I think -- maybe more than that, but, yes, it was not 15 significant. 16 Q Well, if it was more than six, but not significant, 17 what number in your head today are you thinking?

18 A It could be six. 19 Q So that would mean that you were paid $1.2 million for 20 six communications, that's $200,000 a communication; correct? 21 A Correct. 22 Q And that's the deal they entered into; right? 23 A It is. 24 Q And what I mean by that is when you hire -- when you 25 enter an Agreement with AT&T or Novartis or Columbus Nova, it's 13 communications with them; is that right?

4084 1 a Consulting Agreement, they can use you as much as they want; 2 right? 3 A Or as little or -- 4 Q Or as little as they want.

6 A They could have.

7 Q And under the Agreement, you would have had to talk to 8 them; right? 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q Same with all of them? 11 A Same with all of them.

12 Q That's the way that a Retainer Agreement works; right? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q Meaning, it's not conditioned on the quantity of work 15 that is done? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Q Well, a Retainer Agreement with Novartis -- 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

20 THE COURT: I will allow it. 21 Q It's a Consulting Agreement --
5 So if AT&T wanted to call you every day, they could?

22 THE COURT: I'm sorry? 23 Q A Retainer Agreement with Novartis -- 24 THE COURT: Actually, you are right.

25 Sustained.

4085 1 Q Well, what types of decisions do you think about when 2 you are trying to figure out whether to sign with a -- as a 3 consultant, whether you should represent a company? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 5 THE COURT: Overruled. 6 A I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand the question. 7 Q I mean, we talked about different prices: Novartis was 8 $100,000 a month; Columbus Nova was $80,000 a month; AT&T was 9 $50,000 a month.

10 What type of -- what goes into your strategy or decision 11 making when deciding what the right number was? 12 A It was based upon my communications with them. 13 Q Meaning, both sides talked about what the expectations 14 were, including how much to pay a month? 15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q And were there clients that you started talking to that 17 you ultimately didn't agree to work with?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q And that happens a lot; right? 20 A It happened quite often. 21 Q So, you also had retainers with Avenue Ventures; is 22 that right? 24 Q What is Avenue Ventures? 25 A Avenue Ventures was a gentleman who, his name is Imaad 23 A No, sir.

4086 1 Zuberi, who I had met during the course of the campaign.

2 And the things that Mr. Zuberi was asking of me were not 3 things that I would agree to do, which dealt with lobbying or 4 Government relations. 5 And so I never agreed to represent him. 6 Q So you weren't their consultant? 7 A No, sir. 8 Q What about Korea Aerospace? 9 A KAI. Yes, sir.

10 Q Were you their consultant? 11 A Yes, sir. 12 Q How much did they pay you a month? 13 A I believe it was $100,000 a month. 14 Q For how long? 17 Did they -- were they your client the entire year?

18 A No, sir. 19 Q How long? 20 A Ummm, six, seven months, I believe. 21 Q So, in the six or seven months, how many communications 22 did you have with them? 23 A Approximately a dozen. 24 Q What about BTA Bank? 25 A Yes, sir.

16 Q And so, that's 1.2 million. 15 A For one year.

4087

1 Q Was that one of your clients?
2 A Yes, sir. 3 Q How much did they pay you a month? 4 A I believe it was supposed to be $150,000 a month. 5 Q When you say "supposed to be," it sounds like they 6 didn't pay you $150,000 a month? 7 A No, sir. 9 A I believe for two or three months.

10 Q So, they paid you $450,000 and then the relationship 11 went away or what happened? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q How many communications did you have with BTA Bank in 14 that two or three months? 15 A Again, approximately 20 communications. 16 Q Now, so we talked, I think, just about just about six. 17 Did you --
18 A There was one additional. 19 Q Go ahead. What was the one additional? 20 A A gentleman by the name of Franklin Haney, who, again, 21 I had met through Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, who had a nuclear 22 facility that he had purchased from TVA, Tennessee Valley 23 Authority, and he was trying to obtain assistance with financing 24 on the re-activation of this nuclear facility to create both 25 jobs as well as to lower the cost of energy substantially.

8 Q How much did they pay you?

4088 1 Q How much did he pay you a month?

2 A He paid me an initial retainer amount, I believe it was 3 $50,000, but he had offered more, I was to receive 15 percent 4 carry interest in the company if I was successful. 5 Q And what timeframe did you represent him in 2017? 6 A Towards the end. 7 Q So, you had the Retainer Agreements that we just talked 8 about, you had a retainer -- President Trump was paying you 9 $35,000 a month; correct?

10 A Correct. 11 Q And then in 2018 -- I want to move into 2018, early 12 2018 is when the Stormy Daniels' payment leaked; correct? 13 A Correct. 14 Q And you told multiple people when it first leaked that 15 President Trump knew nothing about the payment; correct? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q Do you know somebody named Andrew Albstein?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q Who is Andrew Albstein? 20 A He's a real estate attorney. 21 Q And he's a longtime friend of yours? 22 A Yes, sir. 23 Q Do you remember going with him in 2018 to visit 24 somebody who was in jail by the name of Steven Croman? 25 A Yes, sir.

4089 11 right?

12 A I'm sorry, one more time, please. 13 Q When you went to visit him in jail, it was right after 14 the story had been leaked that you had made the payment to 15 Stormy Daniels; correct? 16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q And do you remember saying that both of them --
18 insisting to both of them that President Trump knew nothing 19 about it?

20 A I don't recall specifically saying that, but it would 21 have been what I would have said at that time, yes, sir.

22 Q And, do you remember saying that you had made the deal 23 and President Trump did not know? 24 Do you remember saying that?

25 A No, sir.

8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q And this was around the time or right after the time 10 that the story of you making the payment had been released; 5 Q And so, you and Mr. Croman went to -- I'm sorry, you 6 and Mr. Albstein went to visit Mr. Croman, who is in jail here 7 in New York City?

1 Q Steven Croman was a mutual friend of the two of yours; 2 is that right? 3 A I went to college with Steve Croman and continue to 4 this day to be friends.

4090 1 Q Would it have surprised you that you made that 2 statement at the time? 3 A No, sir. 4 Q Do you remember saying that you even called Melania, 5 the First Lady, and told her that President Trump didn't know 7 A No, sir.

11 Q But you don't recall saying that to the -- to your 12 friend, Mr. Albstein, and the gentleman who was in prison? 13 A Correct. 14 Q Do you remember being told at the time that you should 15 keep that quiet? Meaning, keep it quiet what you knew or didn't 16 know about the payment? 17 A Not that I recall, no, sir.

18 Q Well, putting aside whether you were told that, I guess 19 you didn't keep it quiet; right? 20 A I did not. 21 Q You spoke to -- again, we talked about it a lot, but 22 you spoke to Ms. Haberman and told her that President Trump 23 didn't know about it; right? 24 A Yes, sir. 25 Q And you also -- and you said that on the record; right?

8 Q Well, did you call the First Lady and say that 9 President Trump didn't know about it?

10 A Not that I recall, no, sir.

6 about it?

1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q You recorded conversations with multiple reporters 3 where you told them you didn't know; correct? 4 A No, sir. 5 Q Do you recall a conversation with a reporter named 6 Suzanne Kianpour with the BBC? 7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q Do you recall recording a long conversation with her in 9 early February about the payment?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q And do you recall telling her that there is no way you 12 had told President Trump about it at the time? 13 Do you remember telling her that? 14 A Sounds correct, yes. 15 Q Now -- and you didn't tell that reporter you were 17 A No, sir.

18 Q Do you remember telling her, and, again, I'm talking 19 about Ms. Kianpour, that your wife and kids had just found out 20 two weeks earlier? 21 Do you remember saying that? 22 A I don't. 23 Q Well, if you said that, would that have been true? 24 A Yes, sir. 25 Q And then -- and so, just up until April of 2018, 4091 16 recording her; correct?

4092 1 April 17th is when the FBI raided your house; right?

2 A April 9th. 3 Q I'm sorry. Thank you. April 9th. 4 You had told anybody who asked, that President Trump knew 5 nothing about the payment at the time; correct? 6 A That's what I said, yes. 7 Q You said that to reporters? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q You said it to friends?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 Q And until at least recently in 2018, you had said it to 12 family; correct? 13 A Correct. 14 Q And then April 9th the FBI raided your hotel room, 15 apartment, TD Bank and office; correct? 16 A Correct. 17 Q And a week later you went and met with a lawyer named 18 Bob Costello on April 17th, 2018; correct? 19 A No, sir. 20 Q No? 21 A No. 22 Q What do you recall? 23 A I received communication from Jeffrey Citron asking to 24 set up a meeting with him and Bob Costello in order to discuss 25 possible representation of me.

4093 1 Q Right.

2 So on April 17th, you went and had a meeting with Mr. Citron 3 and Mr. Costello in a conference room in the hotel you were 4 staying at; correct? 5 A Yes. They came to me. 6 Q And it was about a two-hour meeting? 7 A I don't recall how long. 8 Q Do you -- you said last week that you thought that they 9 brought a Retainer Agreement that day; is that right?

10 A I believe that they brought some form of Retainer 11 Agreement, yes. 12 Q Are you sure that it was that first meeting and it 13 wasn't several days later, like April 20th or several days 14 after, that they brought in the Retainer Agreement? 16 Q But it was early on? 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q Fair. 19 Now, do you recall -- well, let me back up. 20 After that initial meeting, is it fair to say that you have 21 multiple communications with Mr. Costello over the next several 22 months? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q How many do you think that you had on the phone? 25 A On the telephone?

15 A It could have been.

4094 1 Q Yes. On the telephone?

2 A Ten. Maybe, maybe a few more. 6 A Correct. 7 Q On -- now, after that first meeting, a few days later, 8 on April 23rd, do you remember Mr. Costello calling, following 11 Do you remember that? 12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q So I want to show you what has been marked for 14 identification as B106. Just for you, the parties and the 15 Court. 16 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 17 **********
18 Q I'm sorry, I said 106. I meant 1006. 19 (Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.) 20 ********** 21 Q Take a look at that email. And the top half is 3 Q And those would have been between like, around the time 4 that you had met with him the first time and then whenever you 5 stopped talking to them, a few months later; right? 9 up with you, saying that he had spoken to somebody that you had 10 asked him to speak to?

22 redacted. 23 But take a look at that email and see if it's an email from 24 Mr. Costello to you. 25 A Yes, sir.

1 Q Is that an email from Mr. Costello to you on 2 April 23rd, 11:44, a.m.? 3 A It is. 4 MR. BLANCHE: And we offer it. Part of it is 5 redacted, the upper half is redacted. 6 THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. 7 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B1006. 8 THE COURT: Any objection? 9 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.

10 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 11 (So marked in evidence.) 12 ********* 13 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put it up on the screen, 14 please. 15 (Displayed.) 16 MR. BLANCHE: If can you blow up the two paragraphs 17 and then the first four or five lines.

18 Q So that's an email from Mr. Costello to you on Monday, 19 April 23rd, 2018, at 11:44; correct? 20 A Correct. 21 Q "Attorney-client privileged communication. Michael," 22 it says: "I spoke with the person you asked me to and he said 23 that he would find out exactly how the matter ended up in the 24 SDNY, and in particular who in Main Justice approved this." 25 Do you see that?

4095 4096 1 A I do.

2 Q And who did you ask him to discuss about that? 3 A I believe it was Rudy Giuliani. 4 Q But you asked Mr. Costello to find out from 5 Mr. Giuliani why the case was in the SDNY and who approved it; 6 right? 7 A Correct. 8 Q Now, by the way, this is right after -- a few weeks 10 A Correct. 11 Q And, at that point, you didn't really know why they 12 searched your office, hotel room, apartment; correct? 14 A No. 13 You didn't know? 15 Q You later found out they were looking at bank records; 16 right? 17 A Amongst other things.

18 Q Amongst other things. 19 But they were looking at -- part of their probable cause for 20 the search warrant was Mr. Freidman; right? 21 A Yes, sir. 22 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan 23 Pearce-Bates relieved Lisa Kramsky as the official court 24 reporter.) 25 **********
9 after your -- the search warrant; right?

4097 1 M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche 2 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
3 2 Q The guy that you were in business with -- not in 4 3 business with.

5 4 The guy that you had loaned tax medallions to for many 6 5 years?

7 6 A I had leased taxi medallions to him.

8 7 Q Now, if we look at the rest of that email, it looks 9 8 like -- well, what Mr. Costello says to you, is that he thought 10 9 he would have no problem tracking that down, and that he might 11 10 have the answer the night before, but that hasn't happened, 12 11 right?

13 12 So, Mr. Costello is telling you he asked the question 14 13 and he is waiting for an answer back, right?

15 14 A Correct.

16 15 Q So, let's look now -- if I can show you what's been 17 16 marked for identification as B-1008.

18 17 MR. BLANCHE: Just for the -- just for the 19 18 witness, the parties and the Court.

20 19 (Displayed.)
21 20 Q Take a look at that email and tell me whether you 22 21 recognize it?

23 22 Now, while you are looking at it, Mr. Cohen, for 24 23 reasons that they were produced, you will notice that they are 25 24 reversed.

26 25 Does that make sense?

27 Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
 Principal Court Reporter
4098 1 Meaning, the bottom email is actually sent on May 16th 2 at 12:16, and the top email is sent May 15th at 1:42. 3 Do you see that? 4 A I do.

5 Q But do recognize an email, the top email, from you to 6 Mr. Costello, Mr. Citron and a bottom email from Mr. Costello 7 to you? 8 A I do. 9 Q And the top email was sent, like I said, on the 15th, 10 but the bottom was sent on the 16th, correct? 11 A Correct.

12 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B-1008. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 14 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

15 (Document is received in evidence.) 16 MR. BLANCHE: If we can show that to the jury.

17 And, actually, blow up the bottom email first, 18 which is -- sorry. 19 Can we get out of that and blow up the top email?

20 (Displayed.) 21 Q This is an email from you, right, to Mr. Costello?

22 And it says, Bob, as I have stated in the past, when 23 the right time comes, and now is not the right time, we will 24 advance our conversations regarding this issue. Too many hands 25 right now with all varying viewpoints and ideas, right?

4099 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q You asked Mr. Costello to reach out to Mr. Ryan. 3 Mr. Ryan is your lawyer from McDermott Will and Emery 4 at the time, right?

5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q He was representing you in the Mueller investigation?

7 A As well as the Congressional. 8 Q And the Congressional investigation. 9 And then you say to Mr. Costello that he can reach out 10 to you, but you do not want him communicating on your behalf 12 A Yes, sir. 13 MR. BLANCHE: We can pull that out. 14 Q And then he writes back to you.

15 Mr. Costello writes back to you the next day, 16 May 16th, and he is trying to reassure you, correct?

17 A Correct.

18 Q Now, at that point they wanted to -- they, meaning Mr. 19 Citron and Mr. Costello, wanted to speak with you again, right?

20 A Correct. 21 Q And you indicate that confirms that you asked 22 Mr. Costello to reach out to Mr. Ryan, right? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q And then they claimed they won't pester you, correct?

25 A Correct.

11 with anybody, correct?

4100 1 Q So, would it surprise you to learn that you actually 2 communicated on the phone, either you calling Mr. Costello or 3 Mr. Costello calling you, 75 times? 4 A It seems excessive, but possible.

5 Q And do you -- what it -- would it surprise you to 6 learn that there were multiple calls that lasted longer than a 8 A No, sir.

11 A No, sir.

18 A I don't know if I initiated them or responding to a 19 request to call him or just accepting his phone call.

20 Q Well, just try to -- the best of your recollection, 21 based on your recollection, do you recall you initiating more 22 phone calls or Mr. Costello initiating more phone calls? 23 A To the best of my recollection, I believe Mr. Costello 24 reached out more to me.

25 Q Did you -- and I want to make sure I understand your 9 Q That you spoke over nine hours over the course of a 10 few months with Mr. Costello, would that surprise you?

12 Q Do you remember having a phone call over Memorial Day 13 weekend with Mr. Costello that lasted an hour and a half? 14 A I don't recall that, if that was Memorial Day weekend.

15 Q Do you remember weekend calls that lasted a long time? 16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q And you initiated a lot of those calls, correct?

7 half hour?

4101 1 testimony from last week, those nine hours of calls that you 2 had, how many times did you meet with him personally? 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 4 THE COURT: Overruled. 7 A I believe it was once or twice. 8 Q So, the two times you met with him, and all of the 9 phone calls you had with him, you understood at the time that 10 those were privileged communications, right? 11 A Yes, sir.

12 Q Because you hadn't signed an Engagement Letter, right? 13 A No, sir. 14 Q But that doesn't mean that a conversation isn't 15 privileged? 16 A Anticipation of potential representation.

17 Q So, the signing of -- the fact that you had not signed 18 an Engagement Letter with Mr. Costello didn't mean that those 19 phone calls weren't privileged and didn't mean that those 20 meetings weren't privileged, right? 21 A Correct.

22 Q Now, I am going to show you another email. 23 MR. BLANCHE: Which we can show the witness, 24 parties and the Court, B-1003.

25 (Displayed.)
5 Q How many times, if you can recall, did you meet with 6 Mr. Costello in person?

15 Q This is an email on April 19th from Mr. Costello to 16 you saying, I am sure you saw the news. Rudy is joining the 17 Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which 18 would be very well useful -- very, very useful for you and Bob 19 Costello.

20 MR. BLANCHE: And then, if we can go to the 21 statement back.

22 Q This is from you, Mr. Cohen. 23 You say, Robert, great news for Rudy. I know I owe 24 you a call. You have been working for lawyers all along and 25 just now coming up for air, correct?

8 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 7 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B-1003.

4103 1 A That's correct.

2 Q After the first time you met with Mr. Costello, Rudy 3 was hired to represent President Trump, right? 4 A Correct.

5 Q And Mr. Costello was telling you about that? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Now, I am going to show you People's Exhibit 208, 8 sorry, in evidence. This was shown to you last week, Mr. 9 Cohen.

13 Q And then -- so, this is an email from Mr. Costello to 14 you a little bit later in time.

15 This is June 14, 2018, correct? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And this is in response to you getting an email from 18 them that had an attachment that says, Giuliani on possibility 19 of Cohen cooperating on Mueller probe.

5 A Correct. 6 MR. BLANCHE: We can take that down, please.

7 Q Now, I am going to show you B-1013, 1013, marked for 10 Q Is that an email from you to Mr. Costello, same day, 11 June 14th at 11:44 a.m.?

12 A Yes. 13 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B-1013. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.

15 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 16 (Document is received in evidence.)
17 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put that up on the screen 18 and just blow up the top.

20 Q This is an email from you to Mr. Costello talking 21 about -- it looks like a different article that says, Trump's 22 campaign to discredit Michael Cohen is already underway, right? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q That's what the title says?

25 And you wrote to Mr. Costello, since we are sharing 19 (Displayed.)
8 identification. 9 (Displayed.)
4105 1 this morning, they are again on a bad path, right?

2 A Yes, sir. 3 Q And you were talking about President Trump and his 4 team trying to discredit you, correct?

5 A Correct. 6 Q And this was during that time when you were still --
7 you had not decided you were going to cooperate yet, correct? 9 Q But you decided to cooperate shortly thereafter this 10 time, within a month or so, is that right?

15 it.

18 Q That is another email from Mr. Costello to you on 19 June 28th?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we offer B-1014.

23 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 24 (Document is received in evidence.)
25 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put that on the screen 11 A Correct.

12 Q Now, I am going to show you one more email, B-1014. 13 (Displayed.) 14 Q Take a look at that and tell me whether you recognize 16 Do you recognize that?

17 A I do, sir.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.

8 A Correct.

4106 1 and just blow up the bottom portion.

2 (Displayed.) 3 Q So, this is Mr. Costello's email to you on June 28th 4 in response to what looks like a question from you, is that 5 right, Mr. Cohen? 6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q And what you wrote is, or what he writes to you is, 10 investigation based upon the findings of the IG Horowitz 11 Report.

12 Do you see that right? 13 A I do. 17 A Correct.

18 Q And is that -- 19 MR. BLANCHE: We can take that down.

20 Q Mr. Cohen, is that consistent with your memory of the 21 types of things you were talking about with Mr. Costello at 22 that time? 23 A Yes. 24 MR. BLANCHE: Now, can you also put that same 25 Exhibit back up, again, please?

14 Q So, he was answering a question that you had asked 15 about what was going on in DC about the Mueller case and your 16 investigation, correct?

8 the answer about why they haven't brought an action challenging 9 Mueller, his investigation, and the Michael Cohen referral and 4107 1 So, Exhibit 1014, and go to the second page at 2 the top.

## 3 (Displayed.)

4 Q You were also talking to him about who was going to 5 pay for Mr. Costello, correct? 6 And the reason why I ask that question, Mr. Cohen, is 7 because it looks like the earlier email that we just showed 8 you, you write to Mr. Costello, not sure what concerns, meaning 9 what concerns you have, sir, other than nonpayment that you 10 expressed that you told Mr. Costello about, and that was your 11 lawyers had stopped getting paid, correct?

12 A And McDermott Will and Emery. 13 Q So, in the time that you started speaking with Mr. 14 Costello in April, and now there had been a change in whether 15 The Trump Organization was paying the lawyers, right? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And as far as you knew at the time, they had stopped?

18 A No, sir. 19 Q So, what had happened that caused you to write to Mr.

20 Costello, nonpayment I expressed to you? 21 A There was significant invoices that were being sent by 22 McDermott Will and Emery to The Trump Organization for the 23 payment, and the payment was not being made in accordance with 24 the invoices.

25 Q And you wanted Mr. Costello to talk to Mr. Giuliani 4108 1 about why that was happening, is that right?

2 A I expressed to him that the nonpayment was becoming an 5 Q Right. That wasn't my question, Mr. Cohen. 6 It is that you wanted Mr. Costello, in June of 2018, 7 to communicate to Mr. Giuliani about the fact that the 8 nonpayment was becoming an issue, correct? 9 A To keep him advised, yes, sir.

10 Q You asked Mr. Costello to do that, right? 11 A Yes, I believe so.

12 Q Well, do you have any doubt that it was you who 13 initiated that communication to Mr. Costello? 14 A I don't recall if I asked him to reach out to Mr.

15 Giuliani, other than I expressed it to him. 16 Q And then -- and this is late June.

17 Is this around the time your relationship with 18 Mr. Costello and his law firm ends? 19 A Yes, sir.

20 Q That you had been -- like we talked about, you met 21 with him a couple of times and you were talking to them and 24 Q And those are privileged communications, correct?

25 A Yes, sir.

22 emailing them all the way up to this time in June, correct? 23 A Correct.

3 issue, and, yes, to let Mr. Giuliani know to pass it along to 4 President Trump that it is becoming an issue.

1 Q You were seeking advice of counsel from Mr. Costello, 4109 4 Q And he was giving you counsel as well, correct?

5 A Yes. 6 Q But you, to be sure, you never signed the Engagement 7 Letter and you never paid because you didn't sign the 10 Q So, you testified Tuesday and today, I believe, that 11 in that 2017 -- well, in 2017, you made, approximately, how 12 much money, not counting what President Trump paid you? 13 A Approximately, $4 million. 14 Q So, approximately $4 million you made from your 15 consulting agreements, correct? 16 Is that what you are saying?

17 A Correct.

18 Q And then 35,000 from President Trump or from The Trust 19 was another 420?

20 A As reimbursement, yes. 21 Q We know what your view is about that.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 23 THE COURT: Sustained. 24 Q How about the month after -- so the year after. That 25 was 2017.

9 A Correct. 8 Engagement Letter, correct? 3 A Yes, sir. 2 correct?

4110 1 In 2018, the Stormy Daniels payment that you made is 2 leaked in early 2018, correct? 3 A Yes, sir. 4 Q How much money did you make in 2018?

5 A When I said, approximately 4 million, it was from the 6 '17 through the '18 period, I believe.

8 2018?

11 summer of 2018, you made four and a half million?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q Was that the most money you had ever made in a 14 18-month period in your life?

16 Q How much is the most money you made in an 18-month 17 period in your life?

18 A More than $5 million. 19 Q In an 18-month period?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q Now, when you -- in 2018, when you pled guilty, how 22 did you make money between the time you pled guilty and the 23 time that you published your book? 24 A I did not.

25 Q And during that time, is it correct that you paid back 7 Q So did you stop making money when you pled guilty in 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q So, we are talking about January of 2017 through the 15 A No, sir.

4111 1 a lot of your taxes?

2 A I paid the deficiencies of the taxes before 3 sentencing. 4 Q So, that was my question.

5 In between the time you pled guilty, and the time you 6 published your book, you said you didn't have any income, 7 correct? 8 A Correct. 9 Q Correct?

10 A Correct. 11 Q And you had a lot of bills during that time, though, 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q You had -- you paid your -- well, you just said 15 deficiencies in taxes? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And you had to pay lawyers?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q And living expenses as well, correct?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q And then, since your podcast started and you published 22 your book, so that's -- when did you start your podcast? 23 A While I was on home confinement. 24 Q So, that was in 2020?

25 A 2020.

12 correct?

4112 1 Q The fall of 2020?

2 A Yes, sir. 3 Q Does September sound right? 4 A October.

5 Q And you published the book September, same time 6 period, correct?

7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q So, since you started your podcast the fall of 2020, 9 and wrote your book, how much have you made on a yearly basis 10 until now? 11 A In total between the books and the podcasts, about 12 $4 million. 13 Q So, you testified last week that you made 3.4 million 14 from your two books, is that right?

15 A Correct. 16 Q So, are you saying you made about $600,000 from your 17 two podcasts?

18 A Probably more since it started. 19 Q How much more?

20 A A million dollars in total. 21 Q So, that would make it 4.4 million since the fall of 22 2020? 23 Does that sound about right?

25 Q So, that's over a million a year, is that right?

Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
24 A Yes.

4113 1 A Correct.

2 Q How else do you make money? 3 A I have one remaining piece of real estate that has a 4 lease on to it so, the delta between the expenses on that unit 5 and the rent.

8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Did you include that in the million, or is that 10 separate? 11 A It's included.

12 Q And then you testified about the TikToks, but you 13 haven't made significant money off of that?

18 Q Well, who is pitching it if it is not you? 19 A A gentleman who used to be part of the Mea Culpa 20 Podcast named Phil Alberstat in California. He's the one that 21 came up with the idea and asked if he can send a crew to New 22 York to film a potential piece of work. 23 Q But that's with your permission, right? 24 A Yes, sir.

25 Q So, when I said, you are pitching a TV show, I am not 17 A Not pitching it, but there is a television show. 14 A Correct.

17 BY MR. BLANCHE:
18 Q Mr. Cohen, when we took our break you were talking 19 about the show, The Fixer.

20 How long have you been working with the gentleman you 21 described to try to pitch this show?

22 A Approximately, three months. 23 Q And, three months, meaning the past three months? 24 A No, sir.

25 Q When was it?

8 THE COURT: Let's get the jury, please. 9 SERGEANT: All rise. Jury entering. 7 courtroom and was properly seated.)
Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
4116 1 A It was after it was shot, maybe seven, eight months 2 ago, then the next three months thereafter. 3 Q And are you also working on a third book? 4 A I am considering a third book, yes.

5 Q And have you been paid any money upfront for that? 6 A No, sir.

7 Q Are you negotiating to get paid for a third book? 8 A No, sir. 9 Q You recently said that you are actually considering a 10 run for Congress, is that correct? 11 A I did.

12 Q Is that true? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q And did you tell a news article, a news reporter, that 15 one of the reasons why you think you should run for Congress is 16 because you have the best name recognition out there?

17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And you said that because of your work and what you 19 have been doing over the past several years, going after 20 President Trump, correct, that's your name recognition? 21 A I wouldn't characterize it that way.

22 My name recognition is because of the journey that I 23 have been on. 24 Is it affiliated to Mr. Trump?

25 Yes, not because of Mr. Trump.

4117 1 Q Well, the journey you have been on, at least for the 2 past few years, has included daily attacks on President Trump. 4 A My journey is to tell my story, yes, sir.

5 Q That's not my question.

18 you? 19 A Yes, sir.

20 Q Trusted your counsel?

22 Q His family trusted you? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q As far as you know?

25 A As far as I know.

6 My question was, whether your journey has been near 7 daily attacks on President Trump, at least since 2020? 8 A Sure. 9 Q Sir, yes or no?

10 A Yes, sir. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

12 Q Now, you worked as President Trump's lawyer for more 13 than -- what ended up being around 11, 10 and a half years, is 14 that correct?

15 A Correct. 16 Q And during that time you said in your books, and you 17 said publicly, that you believed that President Trump trusted 3 That's part of your journey, right, sir?

21 A Yes, sir.

4118 1 Q His wife trusted you?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And not just trusted you as President Trump's lawyer, 4 but as their own lawyer, correct?

5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q At least for those family members that you 7 represented, correct? 9 Q And along the way you have a traditional 10 attorney-client relationship with President Trump, correct? 11 A Correct.

12 Q And in some ways not traditional, correct? 13 A Correct. 14 Q And he -- and in either scenario, he relied on your 15 counsel, correct? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Q Well, when you were working for him at Trump Org., you 19 were acting as his lawyer, correct?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q And part of your job as his lawyer was to give him 22 counsel, correct? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q And discuss with him whatever he wanted to discuss 25 involving legal issues, correct?

8 A Yes.

1 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, may we approach?

4119 2 THE COURT: Sure. 3 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 4 record.)
5 MS. HOFFINGER: They are straying now, again, 6 into advice of counsel, presence of counsel.

7 THE COURT: Where are you going with this, Mr. 8 Blanche?

21 MR. BLANCHE: One of the reasons his testimony 22 should be rejected is the breach of trust he engaged in. I 23 have a right to establish --
25 You can leave it. You made that out.

9 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, there is, putting aside the 10 advice of counsel defense, which we are not making, never 11 made and never claimed we were going to make, he was his 12 lawyer. There is nothing, in my view, wrong with me asking 13 questions about the trust and counsel that they had, not 14 because we are going --
15 THE COURT: In what context? 16 Where are you going with it?

17 What is the context?

18 MR. BLANCHE: I mean, in summation I anticipate 19 arguing that one of the reasons he should be --
20 THE COURT: What is it --
24 THE COURT: You made that out.

4120 1 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 2 following occurred in open court.) 3 BY MR. BLANCHE: 7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 8 THE COURT: Sustained. 9 Q Did you -- so, going back, briefly, to the $420,000 10 that you were paid, the first three payments by the Trust and 11 the remaining nine payments by President Trump from his 12 personal account, correct? 13 A Correct. 14 Q Now, the Stormy Daniels payment that you negotiated in 15 October of 2016 was 130,000, correct? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And the $20,000 that you paid back the Red Finch owner 18 adds up to $150,000, right? 19 A Correct.

20 Q The remaining -- the difference between that consists 21 of the gross up and the $16,000 bonus that you claimed Mr.

22 Weisselberg said you got, right? 23 A Correct. 24 Q Now, you received -- you testified that 25 Mr. Weisselberg told you that that was being grossed up because 4 Q So, when did you stop becoming -- when do you view 5 your attorney-client relationship with President Trump as 6 ending?

4121 1 you are in a 50 percent tax bracket, right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q But you didn't claim that $35,000 a month on your 4 taxes?

5 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Sustained.

7 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, may we approach? 8 THE COURT: Yes. 9 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 10 record.) 11 MS. HOFFINGER: This has bean precluded by your 12 decision very clearly. Whatever he did or did not do does 13 not go to the defendant's intent. 14 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, it is an additional 15 $150,000 he stole from The Trump Organization. If you 16 accept his testimony, he was entitled to a reimbursement.

17 THE COURT: You can say he stole money. You can 18 talk about stealing money all you want. 19 Once you start talking about filing taxes, you 20 get into my ruling, and I already precluded that. 21 MR. BLANCHE: Okay.

22 So I can ask him about whether he actually stole 23 more money from the Trump Organization? 24 THE COURT: Okay.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: That has been asked and answered.

4122 1 THE COURT: It has.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: I will object to asked and 3 answered. He made a clear record. 4 MR. BLANCHE: That's regarding the Finch payment, 5 not the $130,000 extra. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: You asked about the gross up with 17 Q And the money that you have made since 2000, okay --
18 so the money you have made since 2000 is a lot more than 19 500,000 a year?

20 A Correct. 21 Q And the money that you made in 2017 when you were 22 President Trump's personal attorney greatly exceeded the 23 500,000 that you were paid every year by President Trump, 24 correct?

25 A Correct.

8 THE COURT: You asked about it a number of times. 9 I think it's best to just move on.

10 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 11 following occurred in open court.)
12 BY MR. BLANCHE: 13 Q So, while you were employed at The Trump Organization 14 for the past five years or so, you were paid, including bonus, 15 just over 500,000 a year? 16 A Correct.

7 regards to that.

4123 1 Q Now, you talked about, and this goes back to Thursday, 2 but you talked about the fact that you actually have a 3 financial interest in the outcome of this case, correct? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 Q Well, do you have a financial interest in the outcome 7 of this case? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Because if President Trump is convicted that would 10 benefit you personally, financially, right? 11 A No, sir.

12 Q Well, then, what is your financial interest in this 13 case?

18 Whether Mr. Trump is ultimately determined innocent or 19 guilty is not going to affect whether I speak about it or not.

20 Q Well, I didn't ask whether it would prevent you from 21 speaking about it.

22 My question was, would you benefit financially from 23 it? 24 And this is different than what you said on Thursday, 25 sir.

16 podcasts. I talk about it on TikTok, and they make money, and 17 that's how I was viewing your question. 14 A Whether or not -- when you say -- said, do I have a 15 financial interest in this case, I may talk about it on my 4124 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

2 THE COURT: Sustained. 3 Q The question to you today is, whether a conviction 4 benefits you financially?

17 against President Trump is a dish that is --
18 A Served best cold. 19 Q Best served cold, correct?

20 A Correct. 21 Q And you meant it when you said it then, correct?

22 You meant it when you said it then? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q And you meant it when you just said it now?

25 A Yes, sir.

8 A The answer is, no. 9 Q It doesn't?

10 A It's better if he is not for me because it gives me 11 more to talk about in the future.

12 Q Now, you also testified on Thursday that you are mad 13 at President Trump, you blamed him, at least in part, for what 14 happened to you, correct?

15 A That's correct. 16 Q You said, and we played it for the jury, that revenge 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Asked and answered, your Honor. 6 THE COURT: I will allow it.

7 You can answer it.

4125 1 Q You also testified last week on Thursday that when you 2 are placed under oath, but it affects your personal life, you 3 are willing to lie, correct? 4 A I am sorry. 8 A Sir, I am not understanding your question. 9 Q Well, when you testified a few months ago in October 10 in a different trial, the question was asked whether you would 11 lie under oath if it affects your personal life, and you said, 12 yes. 13 Do you remember that? 14 A I do.

15 Q And then, I asked you that same exact question on 16 Thursday. I asked you whether it was true that you are willing 17 to lie under oath when it affects you personally and last 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 21 THE COURT: Sustained.

22 Q This trial affects your personal life, doesn't it? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q Now, you also said to this jury, but I want to make 25 sure that I understand, that you would lie under oath out of 18 Thursday you said, yes. And I am just asking you one more time 19 today.

5 Say that again, please. 6 Q You are willing to lie under oath if it affects your 7 personal life, correct?

4126 1 loyalty, correct?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Rephrase the question. 7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q Meaning, the reason why you lied is out of loyalty, 9 and you said it is out of loyalty to President Trump, correct?

10 A Correct. 11 Q So, my question to you is, just restating that, it's 12 true that you will lie out of loyalty, correct? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q Now, would you -- and your testimony remains the same 15 as you gave it last Tuesday, that notwithstanding everything 16 that you have said over the years, you have specific 17 recollections of having conversations on the phone with then 18 candidate Donald J. Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter, 19 correct?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q No doubt in your mind?

22 A It's no doubt. 23 MR. BLANCHE: I have no further questions. 24 THE COURT: People.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes.

5 Q When you lied to Congress, you said you were lying out 6 of loyalty, correct?

4127 1 Thank you, your Honor.

2 May we approach for a moment, your Honor? 3 THE COURT: Yes. 4 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 5 record.) 6 MR. STEINGLASS: So, your Honor has made it clear 7 many times that your rules and Motions in Limine are 8 subject to the door being opened. And I think that Mr. 9 Blanche opened the door wide enough to drive a truck 10 through it on this Red Finch thing. 11 Now --
12 MR. BLANCHE: What did you say? 13 MR. STEINGLASS: The Red Finch issue, the money. 14 As you know from your decision, I have a copy of 15 the decision -- 16 THE COURT: I am aware of it.

17 MR. STEINGLASS: -- he elicited questions about 18 there being cash in a paper bag and implied that there was 19 something untoward going on, which, of course, was going 20 on, but it was a payment for rigging the polls. 21 I think that we are entitled to go into that.

22 They are not allowed to use the ruling as a sword and 23 that's exactly what they are doing. 24 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, absolutely not.

25 I didn't ask questions about money in paper bags.

4128 1 Those were his answers.

2 I asked him if he paid for it. That doesn't open 3 a door. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: You asked, all of that cash.

5 MR. BLANCHE: He said -- I said, how did you pay 6 him?

7 He said, I walked across the street to my bank, 8 and I took out cash. 9 THE COURT: I remember the testimony.

10 MR. BLANCHE: I didn't ask that. It came out. 11 THE COURT: Sure. I will let you finish.

12 Go ahead. 13 MR. BLANCHE: No, Judge, it can't be that I ask a 14 question that just has him saying I paid $20,000, and the 15 witness launches into a story about getting cash over three 16 or four days and putting it in a bag.

17 THE COURT: Mr. Steinglass brought the issue up.

18 I was expecting it. 19 I was expecting it because you asked many 20 questions about his $50,000, and the $20,000, and the 21 $30,000, and you -- you did.

22 You opened the door wide open. 23 I am going to allow it. 24 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 25 following occurred in open court.)
4129 1 THE COURT: Thank you.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 3 REDIRECT EXAMINATION 4 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
5 Q Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. 6 A Good afternoon.

7 Q I just want to ask you some follow-up questions based 8 on defense counsel's questions. 9 Now, defense counsel asked you a question, and it was 10 rather fast, but I want to ask it a little bit more slowly. 11 He asked whether you testified falsely in Congress in 12 2019. 13 Did you testify truthfully in Congress in 2019? 14 A Yes, ma'am.

15 Q Was it in Congress in 2017 that you testified falsely? 16 A Yes, ma'am. That's what I thought he said.

17 Q Was it just a mistake then when you said yes, when he 18 asked you about 2019? 19 A Yes, ma'am.

20 Q Now, defense counsel asked you if you may have 21 discussed other matters on the telephone calls in the morning 22 of October 26th of 2016, with President Trump, meaning other 23 matters, besides the Stormy Daniels matter. 24 Do you remember that question?

25 A I do.

4130 1 Q And you testified that you didn't have a specific 2 recollection about talking about other matters, was that right? 3 A Correct. 4 Q But you did have a specific recollection about talking 5 about Stormy Daniels' payoff to Mr. Trump? 6 A Yes, ma'am.

7 Q And that is because it was important to you at that 8 time, correct? 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 Q So, is it possible that other matters may have been 11 discussed on those calls, but you are sure that the Stormy 12 Daniels matter was discussed? 13 A Yes. 14 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

15 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 Q Now, defense counsel asked you a lot of questions 17 about how busy you were in October of 2016.

18 Do you remember that? 19 A Yes, sir. ma'am.

20 Q Were you pretty busy all the time or just in October 21 of 2016?

22 A I was busy. 23 Q Were you too busy in October of 2016 to finalize the 24 Stormy Daniels' payoff with Mr. Trump?

25 A No, ma'am.

1 Q Were you too busy to get his approval to make that 2 payoff? 3 A No, ma'am. 4 Q Now, Mr. Blanche asked you about an email from Mr.

5 Weisselberg, People's 260 in evidence. 6 It was an email in January of 2017. Mr. Weisselberg 10 Q Did you ever send Mr. Weisselberg a Retainer 11 Agreement?

12 A No, ma'am. 13 Q Why not? 14 A Because it was no legal work that I was to be paid 15 for. There was no Representation Agreement within which to 16 send.

19 Agreement?

20 A No, ma'am. 21 Q And so, ultimately, did Mr. Weisselberg just ask you 22 to send invoices instead for the reimbursement payments? 23 A Yes. Yes. 24 Q Now, both on direct examination when I asked you, and 25 also on cross-examination when Mr. Blanche asked you, he asked 17 Q And was the $420,000 payment that you were owed as 18 reimbursement, did that have anything to do with a Retainer 4131 7 asked you to send in that Agreement we were discussing. 8 Do you remember those questions? 9 A I do.

4132 1 you about legal work that you did and other work that you did 4 A I do.

5 Q And you said you did do some work for Mr. Trump in 6 that year, right?

7 A Correct. 8 Q And you did do some work for his wife in that year? 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 Q And did you ever bill for that work? 11 A No, ma'am.

12 Q And did the $420,000 reimbursement payments have 13 anything to do with that work that you did? 14 A No.

15 Q And in 2018, I asked you some questions about that as 17 Did you do some work in 2018 for Mr. Trump?

18 A I did. 19 Q Did you ever bill for that work?

20 A No, ma'am. 21 Q By the way, did you ever get paid a dime for the work 22 in 2018? 23 A No, ma'am. 24 Q Now, Mr. Blanche asked you all about Consulting

25 Agreements in 2017 and 2018 and other work that you did for
16 well.

2 for Mr. Trump and his family in 2017. 3 Do you remember those questions?

4133 1 other people.

2 Did you ever tell Mr. Trump that you were only going 3 to do work for him and never do any work for anybody else? 4 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

5 THE COURT: Overruled. 6 You can answer.

8 Q There was no such understanding, was there? 9 A No, ma'am.

10 Q Now, Mr. Blanche asked you some questions about Red 11 Finch.

12 Do you remember the questions about the $50,000 owed 13 to Red Finch? 14 A I do.

15 Q Can you tell the jury exactly what the work was that 16 Red Finch did for Mr. Trump?

17 A Red Finch is a technology company that I had asked to 18 assist in a CNBC poll, and the poll was regarding the most 19 famous businessmen in like the last century, and Mr. Trump's 20 name was on that list. 21 And at the beginning of this poll, he was polling 22 towards the very, very bottom, and it upset him. 23 And so, he had me come to his office, and he provided 24 me with a sheet of paper that showed it. I reached out to the

25 gentleman from Red Finch who assured me that he was able to,
7 A No.

4134 1 through the acquisition of IP addresses, to create an algorithm 2 that would ensure that Mr. Trump would rise and rise 3 significantly into this poll. 4 And so, I had expressed what I had learned, and we 5 talked about what number Mr. Trump wanted to finish. 6 Of course, initially, he wanted to be number one, but 7 we didn't think that that was a good idea because it would 8 be -- of course, it would raise red flags. As long as we were 9 in the top 10, we would go into another round.

10 And so, with Mr. Trump's permission, I advised the 11 President, CEO of Red Finch, to start acquiring the IP
12 addresses, and more IP addresses were needed because the volume 13 was actually greater than what we had all anticipated. 14 And so, we had to purchase more IP addresses, and then 15 even more again, until, ultimately, when the poll came to its 16 conclusion Mr. Trump was number nine.

17 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan 18 Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court 19 Reporter Theresa Magniccari.)

5 3 ****
6 4 CONTINUED REDIRECT EXAMINATION
7 5 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
8 6 Q. And just as a reminder, did Mr. Trump say that he 9 7 wouldn't pay Red Finch for that work that they had done to make 10 8 sure that his name was higher in the polls?

11 9 A. Yes.

12 10 Q. Did he say why he wouldn't pay them?

13 11 A. He did.

14 12 Q. What was it?

15 13 A. Because CNBC ended up not continuing and moving forward 16 14 with this poll, and so he didn't feel that he had gotten the 17 15 benefit of what the services were supposed to ultimately 18 16 provide. And that, of course, was being Number 9.

19 17 CNBC also had the right to some language, that they can 20 18 take anybody out of the poll that they wanted to, and so Mr.

21 19 Trump didn't feel that he got the benefit of what the funds were 22 20 supposed to go to, despite achieving Number 9, and refused to 23 21 make the payment.

24 22 Q. So, Mr. Cohen, after some period of time, you felt 25 23 pressure to make some payment to your friend, to your colleague?

26 24 A. Yes. 27 25 Q. And that's after the bills had been outstanding for 28 Theresa Magniccari 29 Senior Court Reporter 4136 1 some period?

2 A. For some period. 3 Q. Now, Mr. Blanche did ask you also about that extra 8 A. For a long time I had been telling them about the 9 $50,000, so I could have collected it for the President of Red 10 Finch. 11 I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus so 12 I just felt it was almost like self-help. You know, I wasn't 13 going to let him have the benefit this way as well. I wasn't 14 going to correct the conversation I was having with Allen about 15 it. I had not only protected him to the best that I could, but 16 I had also laid out money to Red Finch like a year and a half 17 earlier.

18 And, again, $130,000, to have my bonus cut by 19 two-thirds was very upsetting, to say the least. 20 Q. But you admitted on cross-examination that it was 21 wrongful? 22 A. It was. 23 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you last week some questions 24 about the letter that your attorney Steven Ryan wrote for you in 25 February of 2018 and submitted to the FEC in response to that 4 $30,000 that you got from The Trump Organization for Red Finch, 5 you paid your friend 20 but you took the 30. Why did you take 6 that extra 30? Why didn't you just put 20 down on the list 7 instead of 50?

4137 1 complaint; do you remember that?

2 A. I do. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up People's Exhibit 201, 4 please. 5 Thank you.

10 A. Yes, ma'am. 11 Q. He highlighted the second paragraph and read that to 12 you. Do you remember that? 13 A. I do. 14 Q. When he asked you about it, you said it was an 15 omission? 16 A. Correct. 17 Q. When I asked you about it on direct examination, you 18 said it was also misleading and deceptive? 19 A. Yes, ma'am. 20 Q. Can you explain to the jury why it was misleading and 21 deceptive? 22 A. Well, the misleading deceptive line is neither The 23 Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the 24 transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen 25 for the payment directly or indirectly.

7 (Displayed.) 8 Q. Defense counsel showed you this letter. Do you 9 remember that? 6 Put it up for everyone.

4138 1 Q. So, what is omitted from in that paragraph that makes 2 it deceptive? 3 A. The fact that it was paid for by Mr. Trump or the Trump 4 Trust. 5 Q. Did you intend for it to be misleading in that way? 6 A. I did. 7 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at Paragraph 3 8 now and highlight a line that says, "The payment in 9 question does not constitute a campaign contribution or 10 expenditure." 11 (Displayed.) 12 Q. Do you see that line? 13 A. I do. 14 Q. When defense counsel was reading that line to you, you 15 said "correct." 16 Let me ask you the question: Is that a truthful 17 sentence?

18 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 19 THE COURT: Please approach. 20 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebar:) 21 MS. HOFFINGER: So, Mr. Blanche is looking at the 22 transcript. Mr. Blanche read up through that line and he 23 said correct, which I think left a misleading impression, 25 I am asking him if that was a truthful statement. 24 which is, that he was saying that the sentence was correct.

1 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, we're not allowing an expert 2 to talk about what's a truthful statement. He is certainly 3 not going to be able to say whether it was a truthful 4 question. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: That was the question. 6 MR. BLANCHE: That is not the question that I 7 asked. 8 Take a look at the transcript exactly. It was a 9 series of questions about what was truthful, the entire 10 letter. At the time what his testimony was, was everything 11 truthful. Now, the People -- 12 THE COURT: You asked him: Was it truthful? 13 MR. BLANCHE: The whole letter. 14 THE COURT: That section of the letter and asked 15 him, was this part truthful. 16 MR. BLANCHE: He is the witness talking about 17 whether it was not truthful.

18 THE COURT: You asked the question. You asked him 19 the question. 20 MR. BLANCHE: Before this question is answered, we 21 should look at the transcript. 22 THE COURT: Look at it. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Page 3570. I have the wrong one. 24 I apologize. It's 3963. 25 MR. BLANCHE: Okay.

4139 4140 1 MS. HOFFINGER: You just said: Correct?

10 MS. HOFFINGER: That's why -- then he said a few 11 seconds later, "Is everything that you said in the letter 12 true?" It left a misimpression. 13 THE COURT: 3963. 14 "But that is a true statement; right? 15 "ANSWER: That is a true statement. 16 "QUESTION: Meaning, you used your own funds to 17 make the payments to Ms. Daniels?

18 "ANSWER: Correct. 19 "QUESTION: And neither The Trump Organization nor 20 the campaign paid you back; right? 21 "ANSWER: It was a party to the transaction or 22 not."
2 MR. BLANCHE: 3963. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: I have it right here. 4 THE COURT: Show it to me. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: It's a small version. It's a 6 little hard to read without my glasses. If you read that 7 line: Is that correct? 8 MR. BLANCHE: I wasn't asking if it was truthful. 9 I was asking if the letter said it.

23 I am looking for the part where he asked whether 24 it was a campaign contribution. 25 Do you have that?

4141 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Line 17 on 3963.

2 "QUESTION: And that it doesn't constitute a 3 campaign contribution or expenditure, and therefore the FEC 9 hand it to you. It's underlined there, 3963, line 17.

10 MR. BLANCHE: I am asking if it's true. 11 THE COURT: On 3963, beginning on line 17.

21 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 23 left. 22 I thought you made your ruling, which is why I 20 clean that up. 19 THE COURT: The People will have an opportunity to 18 MS. HOFFINGER: Exactly.

17 that the letter says that. 14 jurisdiction over the matter?" 15 "ANSWER: Correct." 16 MR. BLANCHE: I was reading that it's correct, 24 MR. BLANCHE: Depending on the answer, we would 25 ask for an instruction again.

8 MS. HOFFINGER: If you want to look at it, I could 7 MR. BLANCHE: 3963. 5 THE COURT: What page is that? 6 MS. HOFFINGER: 3963. 4 lacks jurisdiction over the matter?"
12 "And that it doesn't constitute a campaign 13 contribution or expenditure and therefore the FEC lacks 4142 1 I am not sure how the witness is going to answer 2 the question. 3 THE COURT: What is your proposed instruction? 4 MR. BLANCHE: If he says that it's not true, that 5 he did commit a campaign violation, we would ask for the 6 instruction that we asked for repeatedly that you gave, 7 the fact that he said that he committed a campaign 8 violation. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Is it your understanding at this 10 point whether that's a false statement in the letter? 11 That's why I am asking. 12 MR. BOVE: That's why we want the clarification. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 14 Thank you. 15 THE COURT: The Court's version is on Page 3964. 16 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:) 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put back up the letter 18 again, People's Exhibit 201. 19 (Displayed.) 20 CONTINUED REDIRECT EXAMINATION 21 BY MS. HOFFINER: 22 Q. And the line in Paragraph 3 that says, "the payment in 23 question does not constitute a campaign contribution;" do you 24 see that line, Mr. Cohen? 25 A. I do.

4143

1 Q. Let me ask you: Was that a true statement?
2 A. No, ma'am. 3 THE COURT: Are you asking for an instruction? 4 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 5 THE COURT: All right. 6 Jurors, you just heard the questions that were 7 asked of Mr. Cohen and his response that it was not a true 8 statement. 9 Put it back up.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: It was the third paragraph. 11 THE COURT: That the payment in question does not 14 I remind you that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to 15 violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, but that 16 evidence has been permitted to assist you in assessing Mr. 17 Cohen's credibility as a witness and help provide context 18 for some of the other evidence that has been offered. 19 You may consider that testimony for those purposes 20 only. 21 Mr. Cohen's plea is not evidence of the 22 defendant's guilt. You may not consider it in determining 23 whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the 24 charged crimes. 25 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

12 constitute a campaign contribution or expenditure, and Mr. 13 Cohen responded that is not true.

4144 1 Can we now put up People's 202 in evidence.

2 (Displayed.) 3 Q. Do you recall, Mr. Cohen, that defense counsel asked 4 you some additional questions about this document? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Is this a statement regarding the FEC matter that you 7 released to the press? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you about one line in this 10 letter, "Just because something isn't true doesn't mean it can't 11 cause you damage; I will always protect Mr. Trump." 12 Do you remember that question about that line? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Do you remember your answer of why you included that 15 line, you said you wanted reporters to believe that it was true? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Now, in general, was the statement that you issued to 18 the press overall, was it false or misleading? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Why was it so? 21 A. Again, it goes back to the part about neither The Trump 22 Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the 23 transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed me for the 24 payment either directly or indirectly. 25 Q. So what was missing?

4145 3 Q. And did you intend it to be misleading in that way? 4 A. Yes, ma'am. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up the line at 6 the end of the second paragraph. 8 Q. "The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and not a 9 campaign contribution or campaign expenditure by anyone."
10 Do you see that line? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Was that truthful? 13 A. No, ma'am. 14 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 15 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 Q. Did Mr. Trump approve the substance of the false 17 statements by you?

18 A. Yes, ma'am. 19 Q. And, in fact, had you provided the substance of this to 20 Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump's attorney? 21 A. I did. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take that down and put up 23 People's 216 in evidence. It looks like I have the wrong 24 exhibit. 25 Can you blow up the line that client says "thank 1 A. Who made the payments, that's either the Trump Trust or 2 Mr. Trump himself. 7 (Displayed.)
4146 1 you for what you do."
2 (Displayed.) 3 Q. What was your understanding of what that was about? 4 A. It was about the sum and substance of the response that 5 I just read. 7 You can take that down. 8 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you some questions about 9 whether NDA's or Settlement Agreements happen all the time. Do 10 you remember those questions? 11 A. I do. 12 Q. And he asked you whether in a normal situation an NDA 13 was perfectly legal; do you remember that? 14 A. Yes, I do. 15 Q. You said it was? 16 A. I do. 17 Q. Do you remember that?

18 A. I do. 19 Q. Were the circumstances surrounding this NDA, your 20 paying Stormy Daniels at Mr. Trump's direction and for the 21 principal purpose of his election, was that perfectly legal? 22 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 24 Please rephrase. 25 Q. Was the circumstances of this NDA that you testified 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

23 THE COURT: Sustained to leading.

4147 1 to, was that perfectly legal?

2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Overruled. 4 Q. I couldn't hear your answer. 5 A. Can you repeat it? 6 Q. Under the circumstances of this NDA with Stormy Daniels 7 that you testified to, was it perfectly legal under those 8 circumstances? 9 A. No, ma'am.

10 Q. On August 21, 2018, did you plead guilty to making an 11 excessive campaign contribution in violation of the Federal 12 Election Campaign Act in connection with that payoff to Stormy 13 Daniels? 14 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 15 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 A. I did. 17 Q. On Thursday I believe defense counsel read to you what 18 you said at your hearing about the crimes of tax evasion and 19 false statements to a bank; do you remember that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. And he asked you what you said with respect to those 22 charges; do you remember? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. Did he ask you what you said under oath about making an 25 excessive campaign contribution in violation of FECA when you 4148 1 paid off Stormy Daniels?

2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

20 those were read is because he later said that he was lying 21 under oath when he had made those statements. That's why 22 we elicited that statement. That is perfectly legal and 23 proper to elicit specific incidents where the individual 24 has lied under oath. 25 The only reason why I elicited those statements 11 witness his allocution of August 21, 2018, and had him say 12 yes, that was what he allocuted to with respect to the 13 counts of tax evasion and the count of false statements to 14 the bank. But he did not read the allocution with respect 15 to the payoff to Stormy Daniels and the payoff to Karen 16 McDougal as being illegal campaign contributions. 17 He read that allocution. I think at this point 18 we're entitled to read the allocutions. 19 MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely not. The reason why 4 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebar:) 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, they can't pick and 6 choose which portion of the allocution to read, at 3801 and 7 3802 -- 8 THE COURT: Go through the sections that he 9 pointed out.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: He specifically read to the 3 May we approach.

4149 1 from him is the witness later on again in this courtroom 2 said that those were lies under oath. He was saying he 3 didn't commit the crime. 4 I wasn't picking and choosing which part of the 5 allocution to read into the record, just the part of the 6 allocution where he specifically said he lied. That's 7 completely different than just letting them blast out that 8 he pled guilty. 9 THE COURT: It's very, very prejudicial to allow 10 it. So I am going to side with the defense. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 12 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court.) 13 MS. HOFFINGER: May we approach for a minute? 14 THE COURT: For the record, the objection is 15 sustained. 16 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebar:) 17 MS. HOFFINGER: I just need a clarification of 18 your decision. I could still ask him when he pled guilty 19 to those two counts what was true then and what is true 20 now. I am not reading the allocution. I could still do 21 that. Given the questions that was just asked on that 22 score, I think I should be able to. I am not going to read 23 the allocution. 24 THE COURT: Look, arguably that would be fine. 25 But I think it came out a couple of times. In an excess of 4150 1 caution, it's better to stay away from it.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 5 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 6 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you last week, and I think 7 today as well, about whether the outcome of this trial affects 8 you personally. Do you remember those questions? 9 A. I do.

10 Q. There were questions about your plea back in 2018 and 11 how that affected you personally. Do you remember those 12 questions? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Now, I know it may feel like you are on trial here 15 after cross-examination, are you actually on trial here?

23 A. No, ma'am. 22 Q. Are you charged with any crimes in this case? 21 A. Yes. 20 Q. Are you a witness here? 19 A. No, ma'am. 18 Q. Are you actually on trial here in this case?

17 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

3 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:) 4 CONTINUED REDIRECT EXAMINATION
24 Q. Is your liberty at stake in this case? 25 A. No, ma'am.

4151

1 Q. Is your wife's liberty at stake in this case?
2 A. No, ma'am. 3 Q. Did we subpoena you to testify here? 4 A. Yes, ma'am. 5 Q. So, is that different -- is this situation here 6 different from the situation you were in in 2018 with criminal 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. You want to explain the difference?

10 A. The other one, it was my life was on the line, my 11 liberty. I was the defendant in that case. 12 Again, here, I am just a nonparty subpoenaed witness. 13 Q. And was there an issue about whether your wife might be 14 charged in that case? 15 A. Yes, ma'am. 16 Q. Now, one moment please. 17 I want to clarify something. When you left The Trump 18 Organization to become Personal Attorney to the President --- 19 withdrawn. 20 You were asked questions about whether you would have a 21 Retainer Agreement when you worked for a company. What's your 22 understanding when a lawyer works for a company about whether 23 one has to have a Retainer Agreement? 24 A. You're an employee, it's unnecessary. 25 Q. To clarify, when you left The Trump Organization, you 7 charges brought against you?

4152 1 were no longer an employee but private counsel when you left in 2 2017? 3 A. That's correct. 4 Q. Did you ever put together a Retainer Agreement for any 5 work that you did for President Trump? 6 A. No, ma'am. 7 Q. Why was that? 8 A. I never expected to get paid and -- 9 Q. Did you offer any -- did you ever bill for any services 10 or work that you did for President Trump in 2017 or 2018? 11 A. No, ma'am. 12 Q. Did the $420,000 that you received in 2017 have 13 anything to do with legal services you provided in 2017? 14 A. No. 15 Q. And when you submitted each of your 11 invoices to The 16 Trump Organization stating that each was for services rendered 17 for the month in question pursuant to a Retainer Agreement, was 18 that true or false? 19 A. It was false. 20 Q. And when you received those 11 checks from the 21 Revocable Trust and from Donald Trump in response to those false 22 invoices, was the stub and the stub attached to those checks 23 which said retainer for the particular month, was that true or 24 false? 25 A. It was false.

4153 1 Q. Now, you were asked some questions about Mr. Costello; 2 do you remember that? 3 A. Yes, ma'am. 4 Q. Did you ever sign a Retainer Agreement with him? 5 A. No, ma'am. 7 A. I didn't trust him. I didn't like the way that he kept 8 invoking Rudy Giuliani, and my concern was that anything that I 9 would say to him would immediately go directly back to President 10 Trump. 11 Q. And did you ever agree to pay him anything? 12 A. No, ma'am. 13 Q. Is that why you didn't sign the Retainer Agreement 14 also? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Now, in February of 2019, did you speak to some 17 prosecutors at the Southern District about Mr. Costello?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. Did they have some questions for you about him? 20 A. They did. 21 Q. And in order to answer those questions, did you sign a 22 Waiver Agreement with respect to Mr. Costello so you could 23 answer those questions? 24 A. Yes, ma'am. 25 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up for the 6 Q. Why not?

4154 1 witness, the Court, the parties only, People's Exhibit 2 504AT for identification. 3 Q. Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen? 4 A. I do. 5 Q. What is it? 6 A. This is a waiver document. 7 Q. Did you sign it? 8 A. I did. 9 Q. Who did you provide it to?

10 A. To your office. 11 Q. Understood. 12 But prior to our office in 2019, do you know who? 13 A. The Southern District of New York. 14 Q. Is that an exact copy of the Waiver Agreement and is it 15 signed by you? 16 A. Yes, ma'am. 17 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer that in evidence.

18 MR. BLANCHE: No objection. 19 THE COURT: It's accepted into evidence. 20 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 504AT was received 21 and accepted into evidence.) 22 Q. Can we read that for the jury? First paragraph and 23 then the second paragraph? 24 A. "I, Michael D. Cohen, hereby declare: 25 One: I am the defendant in the above-captioned case.

4155 1 Number two: I was previously represented by the law 2 firm of McDermott Will & Emery in connection with the 3 investigation that preceded this case, the SDNY investigation, 4 as well as in connection with investigations into alleged 5 Russian influence in the 2016 Presidential Election. 6 During the period in which I was represented by MWE, I 7 was approached by Robert Costello, Esquire, of the law firm of 8 Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLC.

13 Although, I subsequently had several other 14 conversations and communications with Costello, at no time did I 15 sign a retainer or otherwise agree to retain Costello, nor did I 16 ever consider Costello or any lawyer at DHC to be my attorney. 17 Although, I do not believe that any of my 18 communications with Costello or other lawyers at DHC are subject 19 to attorney-client privilege, I hereby waive whatever 20 attorney-client or other privilege that might be argued. I have 21 attached such communications." 22 Q. You can take that down. 23 There was a last line there. I apologize. 24 A. "I have discussed the foregoing with my current counsel 25 and am making this waiver knowingly and voluntarily."
9 Costello sought to represent me in connection with the 10 SDNY investigation and presented me with a Retainer Agreement. 11 I declined to sign the Retainer Agreement and informed 12 him I was already represented.

4156 1 Signed on February 7, 2019.

2 Q. So you waived any privilege you might have with respect 3 to communications with Mr. Costello so you could answer 4 questions; is that right? 5 A. That's correct. 6 Q. You are able to answer questions here because you 7 waived any privilege; is that right? 8 A. That's correct. 9 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you some questions last week 10 about some of your texts with people, texts with Keith 11 Schiller, texts with other people that you know. You were 12 asked today about some texts. They asked you some questions 13 about phone calls, emails and conversations that you taped with 14 various individuals. 15 Do you remember all those questions? 16 A. I do. 17 Q. And in January of 2023, when you surrendered your 18 phones to our office voluntarily, did you understand that we 19 would copy everything on those phones and turn over a copy of 20 all that material to defense counsel? 21 A. Yes, I was advised. 22 Q. You were aware that we did turn over all of that 23 material to defense counsel? 24 A. Yes, ma'am. 25 Q. Now, last week Mr. Blanche asked you some questions 4157 1 about your lawyer submitting an application in November of 2023 2 to a Federal Judge for early termination of your supervised 3 release. 4 Do you remember those questions? 5 A. I do. 8 real cases. 9 Do you remember those questions?

10 A. I do. 11 Q. And you explained some of what occurred to Mr. Blanche. 12 Can you explain a little bit more about what happened ? 13 Did you intend to mislead anybody about those Google 14 Bard searches and providing those cases to your lawyer? 15 A. No. 16 Q. Can you explain a little bit more about what happened? 17 A. Again, I went on to Google Bard, which is an AI search 18 engine, and I typed in the query, "Second Department New York 19 cases regarding early termination of supervised release" based 20 upon certain factors. 21 And it gave me a plethora of cases that appeared to me 22 to be legitimate. They certainly looked legitimate. There were 23 facts behind it that supported what we were going to put in this 24 upcoming motion. 25 And so, after I just copied and pasted the first three 6 Q. And he asked about your role in your lawyer's 7 submission of some legal cases that turned out to be fake or not 4158 1 because they were on point, I sent them over to my lawyer's 2 office to review and incorporate into the document. 3 I was just trying to be helpful. I didn't have any 4 longer, whether it's Westlaw or LexisNexis. 5 Anticipating they would look it over, just to make sure 6 that the information was accurate and correct and fit into the 7 motion that was being put forth on my behalf, I ultimately also 8 sent it to my current lawyer Danya Perry, and she noticed that 9 these cases were not legitimate. They were created by the AI
10 program which wanted to -- it wants to please the user. So it 11 created these hypotheticals. 12 And Ms. Perry immediately notified me that they're 13 wrong and that we should notify the Court, to which I sent her 14 "Absolutely, please do it." 15 At which point, Ms. Perry went ahead and sent the 16 letter to the Judge advising him that these three cases, the 17 citations are inaccurate, and Ms. Perry even went so far as to 18 then find three cases that were directly on point, just 19 different names, different citations, but with the same 20 underlying facts. 21 Q. So your lawyer notified the Court that the cases were 22 not accurate? 23 A. Yes, I authorized her to do that when she advised me 24 that the citations were inaccurate. 25 Q. Now, you were questioned by defense counsel regarding a 4159 1 call at 8:02 p.m. with Keith Schiller and Mr. Trump on October 2 24, 2016. Do you remember those questions? 3 A. I do. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up just please for the 5 witness, the parties and the Court People's Exhibit 417B 6 for identification.

9 A. I do.
10 Q. Who do you recognize in that picture? 11 A. I recognize President Trump who is off to the right, 12 and in the dead center Keith Schiller. 13 Q. What is Keith Schiller wearing in the picture? 14 A. He is wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and red 15 tie.

7 Q. Do you recognize anyone in People's Exhibit 417B for 8 identification?

16 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, we offer that in 17 evidence.

18 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 19 THE COURT: Please approach. 20 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebar:) 21 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, this is a picture I 22 believe of a rally on that same date, in Tampa, Florida. 23 Now, there is a date on this somewhere, I presume, 24 that says the date. That's inadmissible hearsay. There is 25 no way that this witness can say that this document is --
4160 3 MS. HOFFINGER: I tell you what I am going to do, 4 I skipped a step. I am going to offer one more picture 5 which is going to also show again President Trump there on 6 that date and ask if it's a true and accurate 7 representation of how Mr. Schiller and Mr. Trump looked in 8 October 2016. 9 If you wish, we can offer it subject to 10 connection. We have an additional witness who will 11 testify. 12 THE COURT: What? 13 MS. HOFFINGER: We have an additional witness who 14 will testify how these screen shots from the video of the 15 rally were obtained. We can do that. It would be subject 16 to connection. If it's just for the purpose of identifying 17 the --
18 MR. BLANCHE: The additional witness is a 19 paralegal who is going to say they Googled it. It's 20 massive hearsay. You cannot admit into evidence for the 21 truth of the photograph for a specific date based upon the 22 paralegal Googling it. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: He reviewed the audio tape. The 24 tape was from C-Span. There's testimony how it's retrieved 25 and how he reviewed the rally. These were screen shots.

1 that this picture is from a rally on that date. It's a 2 complete violation of the laws.

4161 1 THE COURT: Let's take our lunch recess and we can 2 discuss this on the record. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor. 4 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:) 5 THE COURT: Jurors, I remind you of all of my 6 instructions, including not to discuss the case either 7 among yourselves or with anyone else. 8 Please continue to keep an open mind as to the 9 defendant's guilt or innocence.

10 Please do not form or express an opinion as to the 11 defendant's guilt or innocence. 12 I will see you at 2:15. 13 Enjoy your lunch. 14 (Jury leaving courtroom.) 15 *** 16 (Witness leaving courtroom.) 17 ***
18 THE COURT: I thought it would be easier to 19 excuse the jury and discuss this out of the presence of the 20 jury. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: I am going to let Mr. Steinglass 22 speak. 23 MR. STEINGLASS: So, what the proffered exhibits 24 are, 417A and B, are photos of the defendant together with 25 Keith Schiller, that were taken on October 24th, at about 4162 1 7:57 p.m., which shows that they're together.

2 That is in response to any potential defense 3 suggestion that maybe the call that took place on the 4 night of October 24th between Mr. Cohen and Keith 19 proper foundation to admit the photos which proves that the 20 defendant and Mr. Schiller were together at the time of 21 that call on October 24th. 22 THE COURT: So you're offering it to establish the 23 date and the time? 24 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

5 Schiller -- that the defense, should not be able to argue 6 that Mr. Trump was not there and did not participate in the 7 conversation or subsequent conversation during the same 8 call. 9 So I believe that it takes three things to get 10 this photo in. 11 One is that, the witness has to identify the 12 parties, which the witness has done. 13 Two, we have to be able to establish how this was 14 pulled from C-Span's archives, from their website, which we 15 have a paralegal lined up to do. 16 The third piece comes from C-Span themselves, when 17 they testified earlier in this trial, the way they archive 18 and produce case materials, which is enough to lay the 25 THE COURT: Do you have a copy?

4163 1 MR. STEINGLASS: Sure.

2 THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Blanche. 3 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we never asked or 24 There was a ton of foundation laid about the 25 exhibits they were shown that established, indeed, the 10 So the first point that we somehow implied that 11 President Trump and Mr. Schiller were not together, that 12 was not our position at all. It's not going to be our 13 position. 14 Secondly, and more significantly, both of these 15 have the same hearsay problems that we argued, and your 16 Honor didn't go with us, that the Tweets have.

17 There is going to be a witness, apparently, that 18 is going to testify that the only thing that matters about 19 this entire exhibit is the date and time. Okay. That's 20 inadmissible hearsay. It's a business record. And that 21 there was a C-Span witness, and the C-Span witness could 22 potentially authenticate the documents, we don't know. 23 They weren't supplied the documents.

4 implied that Mr. Schiller was or was not with President 5 Trump on that day. 6 What we argued and implied is that the phone call 7 that was made was to Keith Schiller about a completely 8 different topic than what the witness testified to on 9 direct.

4164 1 rally took place that day, and they were perfectly 2 comfortable asking a dozen questions or so, to lay a proper 3 business foundation. 4 And so now they say, well, we laid the proper 5 business for the exhibits that were offered a few weeks 6 ago, we don't want to do that again, we're going to have a 7 paralegal come and say they Googled it. That's an 8 exception to the hearsay rule. That's not the rules. 9 THE COURT: Didn't the witness from C-Span lay the 10 foundation? 11 Didn't that witness testify to the functions and 12 how they maintained the records and the liability, and how 13 long they were doing it? Didn't he lay the foundation for 14 how they were maintained. 15 MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely. They were kept in the 16 archives. When he got the subpoena, he went to the 17 archives and pulled the documents and confirmed they were 18 accurate, which is what the rules require. 19 It seems like it's neither here nor there. We all 20 have Googled. The rules of evidence have to apply. You 21 still have to establish a foundation that isn't met here. 22 Especially when one of these is not a picture of Mr. 23 Schiller. One of them is. And the one that is, again, the 24 only thing -- the only relevance at all about this is, 25 again, the date and the time.

4165 1 And so, it's an out of court statement being 2 offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Just like we 3 said before, but it's even more poignant here. It's 4 inadmissible. 5 MR. STEINGLASS: Well, so, there are a few points 6 I would make here. 7 First of all, I think if you go back and look at 8 the C-Span testimony, which is on Page 1665 through 1667, 9 there is a whole lot of detail about how the camera 10 operator reports the events in realtime. And the camera 11 operator has a business duty to do so accurately. They 12 try to record the entire event. They watch it from end to 13 end to make sure there is no interruptions when it airs. 14 This was not pulled off of Google. This was 15 pulled off of C-Span's website. I believe we can satisfy 16 the foundation requirements. 17 It seems like Mr. Blanche is also making a kind of 18 a relevance argument and saying that it's irrelevant to 19 their arguments that Mr. Trump was together with Mr. 20 Schiller at that time, and not just together, but that the 21 speech ended at 7:57, that the defendant was giving that 22 night. They walked off the stage together at 7:57. 23 That is not what the defense is getting at. It's certainly 24 an implication that was raised by defense's questions. 25 Who knows what they're going to say in their 4166 1 summation.

24 That's for good reason. The rules require it. It's not 3 not wholly responsive to what happened to their arguments, 4 what happened in the phone cal, it's certainly partially 5 responsive for us to be able to prove that the defendant 6 and Mr. Schiller were together at the time of this phone 7 call. And I think that relevancy is a low threshold. 8 So I think there is some probative value to that. There is 9 no prejudice. We can lay the proper foundation. That's 10 all we have to do. 11 MR. BLANCHE: I was not making this argument. I 12 was responding to the People's suggestion when we asked Mr. 13 Cohen we implied that he wasn't with Mr. Schiller. There 14 is no evidence of that. I have significant evidence that 15 he lied under oath when he said he had a conversation with 16 Mr. Trump that night. And that is what I crossed him on. 17 That's the issue.

18 Now, it's not a relevance argument. It's an 19 absolutely inadmissible hearsay argument. 20 If your Honor looks at the testimony from the 21 C-Span witness, including through Page 1668 and 69, there 22 was multiple questions to this witness about how careful 23 the process is to authenticate something that they record.

2 We're entitled to establish -- I realize this is 25 they require it for one rally video. It doesn't count for 4167 23 The C-Span representative testified that the 24 videos are aired in their entirety.

7 MR. BLANCHE: Well, it applies to the process that 8 he went through in responding to the subpoena to confirm 9 that this record that this jury is going to see is a true 10 and accurate business record of C-Span, not of C-Span's 11 website as taken by a paralegal. There is a difference. 12 THE COURT: Give me an offer of proof as to what 13 the paralegal would testify to. 14 MR. STEINGLASS: Essentially, the paralegal will 15 testify that they were on the official website of C-Span. 16 They know how C-Span stores its videos. That this is 17 based part on the familiarity with this case but also on 18 the testimony of Dr. Browning that they were present for. 19 And they will testify that they were able to retrieve this 20 exhibit, and that this exhibit on its face shows that it's 21 a first run, and it started at a particular time, and it 22 ended at a particular time.

1 only this one in Tampa. It's the rules require it. It's 2 not inadmissible. 3 THE COURT: I am sorry. I didn't follow that. 4 He was very careful and he testified in great detail, 5 why are you saying that that testimony does not apply to 6 this rally?

25 I mean, to me, to the extent that this -- that 4168 1 this is not a tight foundation, I think it is a pretty 2 tight foundation. But if the two additional questions 3 would be necessary, we can fly the C-Span representative 6 perfectly sufficient.

12 rep already testified to and one or two more questions 13 would have to be asked in regard to the particular video, I 14 think we can do that. I believe that's an exercise in 15 futility.

22 Judge, whenever a witness who testifies as an 23 exception to the hearsay rule that something is a business 24 record, just because they establish the foundation that a 25 particular document from an organization, or in this case a 9 MR. STEINGLASS: I don't think we need to ask any 10 of the C-Span rep. If Mr. Blanche believes the foundation 11 is somehow insufficient based on everything that the C-Span 7 THE COURT: What would be the two questions that 8 you would ask the C-Span representative be?

16 THE COURT: Let me ask Mr. Blanche why is the 17 foundation that was laid by the C-Span representative, Dr.

18 Browning, why is that foundation not good enough for this 19 document? 20 MR. BLANCHE: There was no foundation laid for 21 this document.

4 back here to answer these questions. But I think that the 5 record as it exists now from the C-Span witness is 4169 1 rally video, is a business record, doesn't mean that 2 whatever else that company produced or whatever else we 3 pull off the internet we can go and borrow those 4 foundational questions. I would say that probably applies 5 to the video as well. It's not the way the rules of 6 evidence work.

11 exception that applies that can easily be cured and that 12 the People will say we tried once, we're not going to try 13 it this time. 14 THE COURT: What are the pages of Mr. Browning's 15 testimony? 16 MR. STEINGLASS: It's Dr. Browning.

17 THE COURT: Dr. Browning. I am sorry.

18 MR. STEINGLASS: I am not sure the pagination on 19 the small version is exactly as your Honor. It's 20 approximately Page 1665. All of his testimony starts on 21 1660 and goes to 1670.

22 THE COURT: I am not concerned. I think it's 23 relevant. I want to look into the hearsay issue. We will 24 discuss it after lunch.

25 Enjoy your lunch.

10 I mean, it cannot be that there is a hearsay 7 By the way, I am sure that the People knew about 8 this issue, we certainly did, before today. And so, they 9 should have brought the witness back.

4170 10 Over lunch I did receive the People's submission, 11 just Section 9.14 of the Rules of Evidence. 12 Also, People v. Goldman, G-O-L-D-M-A-N. That is 13 a Court of Appeals decision, 35 NY 3d 582. 14 I had the opportunity to read through the 15 testimony of Dr. Browning. I wanted to see exactly what he 16 had testified to and what kind of foundation he made. I 17 was able to do that.

18 So beginning on Page 1664, I will be jumping 19 around a little bit. 20 But Page 1664: 21 "QUESTION: What is your position at C-Span? 22 "ANSWER: Executive Director of the C-Span 23 Archives. 24 "QUESTION: How long have you held that position? 25 ANSWER: Thirty-seven years."
4 THE SERGEANT: Remain seated. Part 59 back in 5 session. 6 THE COURT: Before you went to lunch, we had a 7 discussion regarding the People's proposal to introduce 8 into evidence two videos, or at least stills taken from 9 videos. The defense objected.

2 "QUESTION: Did you travel from Louisiana for the 3 purpose of testifying today." 4 "ANSWER: Yes. Yes, I did. 5 "QUESTION: What is C-Span? 6 "ANSWER: C-Span is a public television network to 7 telecast events in their entirety. 8 "QUESTION: As the Executive Director of the 9 C-Span Archives, what do you do?

10 "ANSWER: I mainly collect video that is aired on 11 network."

That's the obligation." 16 Next page. 17 "QUESTION: Does the pool camera operator have a 18 business duty to record that event accurately? 19 "ANSWER: Yes, because C-Span wants the entire 20 event. 21 "QUESTION: How does C-Span ensure that the video 23 "ANSWER: Once the event is taking place, there is 12 Page 1666:

2 "QUESTION: Is the video camera equipment tested 3 before an event? 4 "ANSWER: Yes, they make sure there is a valid 5 signal; they would say the signal is good.

19 about the video library that C-Span archives?

20 "ANSWER: The video library is an online 21 collection of everything that is telecast on C-Span. That 22 is 278,000 digital hours a day. 23 "QUESTION: And that is everything that is ever 24 aired on C-Span?

25 "ANSWER: That's correct.

6 "QUESTION: That's a signal test?

7 "ANSWER: Yes. 8 "QUESTION: Is there also an audio test? 9 "ANSWER: Yes, they will make sure that there is 10 solid audio coming through the event. 11 "QUESTION: While the video is being transmitted, 12 does C-Span record it to its own servers in any way? 13 "ANSWER: Yes, we make copies of the video as it 14 is coming in.

15 "QUESTION: Does C-Span save those videos? 16 "ANSWER: Yes, in the video library, the C-Span 17 archives.

18 "QUESTION: Can you tell the jurors a little bit 4173 1 "QUESTION: It's still being maintained by C-Span?

2 "ANSWER: That's right. 3 "QUESTION: Is it the regular course of business 4 for C-Span to record and save those videos? 5 ANSWER: Yes, it is. 6 "QUESTION: Now, at some point did C-Span receive 7 a document subpoena from the Manhattan District Attorney's 8 Office requiring the company to turn over video recordings 9 of events featuring Donald Trump?

10 "ANSWER: Yes, it did. 11 "QUESTION: Did C-Span comply with its legal 12 obligations to turn over the subpoenaed videos? 13 "ANSWER: Yes, it is. 14 "QUESTION: Are you the one that retrieved the 15 videos in response to the subpoena? 16 ANSWER: Yes, I was. 17 "QUESTION: Can you tell the jury how you 18 identified those videos? 19 "ANSWER: Well, subpoena indicated the videos that 20 were requested, including what we call the URL of the 21 video. But we would verify that each video -- that it 22 matched the subpoena -- what the subpoena was. 23 "QUESTION: Did you confirm that the videos were, 24 in fact, events featuring Donald Trump as identified in the 25 subpoena?

4174 1 "ANSWER: Yes, we did.

2 "QUESTION: Did you transmit exact copies of 3 videos to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office without 4 making any alterations, deletions or changes?

22 First, I appreciate the case law that was 23 referenced by the People during lunch recess. 24 I believe it's distinguishable from what we have 25 going on right here now.

10 "QUESTION: Are all of those files video clips of 11 videos that C-Span produced to the Manhattan District 12 Attorney's Office? 13 "ANSWER: Yes, they were." 14 Line 17: 15 "QUESTION: For each of those clips, did you 16 review both the full video and the video clip and confirm 17 that the clip is an exact copy of the portion of the longer 18 video?" 19 "ANSWER: Yes, I did." 20 The People offered into evidence Exhibits 409A as 21 in Apple to 409D as in Dog.

5 "ANSWER: Yes, I did. 6 "QUESTION: Before testifying today, did you have 7 the opportunity to review files marked for identification 8 as People's Exhibit 409A through 409D? 9 "ANSWER: Yes, I did.

4175 1 I also do agree that certainly the proffered 2 evidence is relevant.

25 that.

11 To suggest that a paralegal or anybody else can 12 now take the stand and based upon Dr. Browning's testimony 13 state that they are now qualified to testify as a records 14 custodian and authenticate the video would mean to suggest 15 whoever was here when Dr. Browning testified would be 16 equally qualified do the same. 17 I don't think we can say that.

18 So the objection is sustained. Those images are 19 not going to come in as offered. 20 Anything else? 21 MR. STEINGLASS: We accept your ruling, but I 22 think that may mean that we want to bring the C-Span rep 3 However, I don't see how the People can get past 4 the hearsay objection. The testimony that was offered by 5 Dr. Browning was a foundation. One, he's highly qualified, 6 and gave foundation for the exhibits that we were going to 7 be accepting, to whom those exhibits were going to be 8 introduced. He didn't lay the general foundation for any 9 and all videos. This goes for some videos that came in 10 through him.

23 back so he could confirm the business records status of 24 that video. So we're making arrangements to try to do 4176 10 I will just cite two quick cases on this point. 11 People V. Hinkley, which is 178 A.D. 2d 800, 12 which says, "The statutory order of trial, CPL Section 13 260.30, is not a rigid framework. The trial Court 14 maintains its commonlaw discretionary power to alter the 15 order of proof, at least up until the time the case is 17 So, that's one cite.

18 This is pretty well established. I will give a 19 couple of quick cites. 20 Court of Appeals, People v. Olsen, 34 N.Y. 2d 21 349. And -- 25 MR. BLANCHE: We very much object. We're, 1 THE COURT: Give me a timeframe.

2 MS. MANGOLD: We just reached out to them. We can 3 update you at the end of today of the timeframe. We asked 4 them to be available as soon as possible. 5 MR. STEINGLASS: The Court has the inherent 6 authority to kind of control the order of proof that takes 7 place in the trial. 8 I don't think there is any reason this has to hold 9 up the defense case or any other witnesses that we have.

24 I will hear from the defense.

16 submitted to the jury."
22 THE COURT: I know I have the authority. I know 23 it's discretionary.

4177 7 certainly as of last Thursday it was something that was 8 elicited on cross-examination before lunch. 9 So, here we are on Monday, and they're about to 20 sooner? 24 Frankly, we thought that the -- I understand your 25 Honor's ruling.

10 rest and they're asking, I guess, for an opportunity to see 11 if this witness can come back. 12 We very much object. We have a witness in the 13 back, that depending on how the rest of the cross goes, and 14 assuming we call the witness, we have another short 15 witness. We anticipate resting as well. At least as of 16 now. 17 We would object and ask that the Court not allow 18 the trial to just go on. 19 THE COURT: People, why wasn't this taken care of 21 MR. STEINGLASS: Well, Judge, we learned of this 22 over the weekend and have been making diligent efforts to 23 move forward on this.

5 So, the People have known about this issue. Well, 6 I don't know how long they have known about this issue, but 4 that we will rest today.

1 presumably, within a few minutes of the People resting the 2 case. 3 We have witnesses here. There is a likelihood 4178 1 I think it certainly was our position that the 2 foundation that was set forth by Dr. Browning was 3 sufficient to do this through this witness, through not 8 I think we have more than a good faith basis to 9 believe it was going to come in.

10 It doesn't seem like Mr. Blanche is going to 11 contest the fact they were together. 12 I am not sure why we're jumping through all the 13 hoops. I understand the rules of evidence apply. They 18 that. 19 That being said, we're doing the best we can to 20 get this witness here as quickly as possible. Hopefully, 21 that will be tomorrow morning. 22 THE COURT: All right. 23 Are you objecting to letting the People finish out 24 this witness and put on your case and then we adjourn to 25 tomorrow morning and call this witness?

4 only through the three pieces that I articulated before 5 lunch. 6 I don't want to characterize your Honor's ruling. 7 I understand it. I will certainly follow it.

15 They don't have to stipulate, for example, that 16 Mr. Schiller was together with Mr. Trump on that date and 17 time. Although, it does not sound like they're contesting 14 have the right to put us through our burden.

4179 1 MR. BLANCHE: Very much so.

8 there was testimony about last week, your Honor -- and I 9 accept that this fact wasn't learned until over the 10 weekend, but the call was made, apparently, over lunch to 11 see if the witness can come out. 12 This isn't a new fact. Presumably, the People 13 prepped Mr. Cohen on this phone call. 14 And I don't -- this is patently unfair in our view 15 for the Court to allow the People, given an obvious ruling 20 THE COURT: I am not going to make you put on your 21 case before they rest. What I could do is simply adjourn 22 until tomorrow. 23 MR. BLANCHE: There have been multiple days where 24 we had to end early because the People are out of 25 witnesses. There has been scheduling issues. That happens 17 redirect, to allow them to stop, to presumably rest or not 18 rest, make us decide if we want to put on a case before 19 they rested for no reason.

4 events. The People rest or we take witnesses out of turn 5 just because we happen to have witnesses here. 6 To allow for the People to try to get a witness 7 here by tomorrow morning to testify about something that 3 MR. BLANCHE: The prejudice is the sequence of 2 THE COURT: What is the prejudice?

16 on the admissibility of a picture -- of a picture on 4180 1 in a trial. I don't contest that.

2 Here we are now where, literally, the People are 3 going to rest, and now they want more time to try to get a 4 witness here tomorrow about something that was had on 5 cross. 6 That's not the way the trial is supposed to work, 7 Judge. 8 THE COURT: People, I would like you to take a 9 minute and see if she can be here 9:30 tomorrow.

10 MR. STEINGLASS: We reached out and we're waiting 11 to confirm.

12 THE COURT: Let's recess and get back to me in a 13 few minutes. 14 (Recess.)
15 *** 16 THE COURT: People, what did you find out?

17 MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, we were able to reach 21 that. 20 travel is not booked yet. But they are preparing to do 22 THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Blanche? 23 MR. BLANCHE: No. Just our continued objection. 24 This will be fifth or sixth time we're going to 25 apparently run out of witnesses for the day.

18 C-Span. They are booking travel right now in order to be 19 available at 9:30 tomorrow morning. They stress the 4181 6 MR. STEINGLASS: That is wrong. We haven't broken 7 early five or six days early. I can remember we broke one 8 day early for a private medical matter that we shared with 9 the Court. That is just wrong.

10 The testimony of this witness is so narrow that 11 none of the proffered defense witnesses spoke to it. There 12 is no particular reason why we couldn't keep going on. 13 If Mr. Blanche wishes to do that or if your Honor 14 has indicated a willingness to adjourn the case until 15 tomorrow and let Mr. Blanche put on his case tomorrow, that 16 is also fine. Essentially, the ball is in Mr. Blanche's 17 court.

18 THE COURT: I remember stopping early one time for 19 medical reasons. 20 Look, if scheduling were an issue, if time were of 21 the essence, I would agree with you, Mr. Blanche. We 22 agreed this morning that we are basically going to have a 23 week down. We're sending the jury home for a week to do 24 nothing. So, there is no prejudice to anyone that I can 25 see whatsoever.

4 compromised by giving the People more time to get the 5 witness.

1 We have witnesses here, ready to go, and we think 2 the decision that your Honor made, that a witness has to 3 come and testify about this shouldn't then be immediately 4182 1 Clearly, it's up to you. You can present your 2 case out of order or once we finish with Mr. Cohen we can 3 adjourn to tomorrow morning.

13 hopefully. We'll be adjourned to Tuesday next week for 14 summations. There is no prejudice to anyone. 15 MR. BLANCHE: May I have two minutes to talk to my 16 team and my client? 17 THE COURT: Sure.

18 (Brief pause.) 19 MR. STEINGLASS: I think we may be able to move 20 this process along. 21 THE COURT: Tell me. 22 MR. STEINGLASS: I think, if I understand what we 23 agreed about, the exhibit will come in through Mr. Cohen. 24 We will not call a paralegal, and we'll agree to the 25 following stipulation:
12 will get the proposed jury charges I believe Thursday, 9 discussed this morning. The plan that we came up with this 10 morning and agreed to remains the same. 11 After tomorrow, after the charge conference, you 4 The witness has to be here at 9:30. The witness 5 has to take the stand at 9:30. If that doesn't happen, 6 we're going to proceed. 7 And after the People rest and you put on your 8 case, we're going to have our charge conference, what we 4183 1 The parties have agreed that People's Exhibit 417B
2 is a still photograph taken from the end of the video 3 which concluded at 7:57 p.m. on October 24, 2016. 4 And we'll just have to ask one more foundational 7 Then we'll put the exhibit in through Mr. Cohen 8 and we'll read the stipulation, and then the exhibit won't 9 be coming in for the timestamp on the exhibit, but the 10 stipulation will cover that. 11 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, you consent to that? 12 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 13 THE COURT: I understand it's a strategic 14 decision. 15 Have you discussed this with your client? 16 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 17 MR. STEINGLASS: So maybe we will read the 18 stipulation after we move it into evidence, after we move 19 the exhibit into evidence. 21 Let's get the witness, please. 22 (Witness entering courtroom.) 23 *** 24 (Jury entering courtroom.) 25 ***

5 We were just taking care of some legal matters. I thank 6 you for your patience.

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 9 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
10 Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. 11 A. Good afternoon.

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up just for the 13 witness, the Court and counsel People's Exhibit 417B. 14 (Displayed.)
15 Q. Mr. Cohen, do you see the picture? 16 A. Yes, ma'am.

17 Q. Before lunch you testified that you recognize Keith 18 Schiller in that picture; is that correct? 19 A. Yes.

20 Q. Wearing a red tie? 21 A. Yes.

22 Q. And also Mr. Trump in that picture? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. Does this photograph fairly and accurately depict the 25 way Keith Schiller and Mr. Trump appeared in October 2016?

8 CONTINUED REDIRECT EXAMINATION
4185 1 A. Yes, ma'am.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, I offer in evidence 3 now People's Exhibit 417B. 4 MR. BLANCHE: No objection.

23 the Stormy Daniels matter? 24 A. Yes, ma'am. 25 Q. And were some of those conversations in person?

9 People's Exhibit 417B is a still photograph taken from the 10 end of a video. 11 The video concluded at 7:57 p.m. on October 24, 12 2016. 13 It's signed by both the prosecution and the 14 defense today, May 20, 2024. 15 THE COURT: Thank you. 16 Q. Mr. Cohen, you testified that you believe that you 17 spoke to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Schiller on that call on October 18 24, 2016, at about 8:02 p.m. 19 Do you recall that? 20 A. I do. 21 Q. During this time period in October of 2016, did you 22 have a number of conversations with Mr. Trump about resolving 5 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 6 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 417B was received and 7 marked into evidence.) 8 MS. HOFFINGER: The parties have agreed that 4186 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Were some of those conversations by phone? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Were some of those conversations longer and were some 5 shorter? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Approximately, how many conversations would you say 8 that you had with Mr. Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter just 9 in October of 2016, if you can approximate?

10 A. More than 20. 11 Q. Now, did you review materials like your phone records 12 and texts and emails before you testified? 13 A. Yes, ma'am. 14 Q. How did reviewing those materials assist you in 15 recalling some conversations? 16 A. It helped to refresh my memory. 17 Q. And do you recall the general substance of the 18 conversations with Mr. Trump? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. For example, do you have any doubt that you had a 21 conversation with Mr. Trump in which he told you in substance to 22 work out the Stormy Daniels payoff with Allen Weisselberg? 23 A. Yes, ma'am. 24 Q. Do you have any doubt that, in fact, you did work that 25 out with Allen Weisselberg?

4187 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Meaning -- I am going to correct the record, I am going 3 to go back. 4 Do you have any doubt that you had a conversation 5 with Mr. Trump that you should work it out with Allen 6 Weisselberg? 7 A. No doubts. 8 Q. Do you have any doubt that you did, indeed, work it out 9 with Allen Weisselberg?

10 A. No. 11 Q. Meaning, do you have any doubt? 12 A. No, none at all. 13 Q. Do you have any doubt in your mind that Mr. Trump gave 14 you the final signoff to go ahead and make the payment before 15 you went to the back to complete that? 16 A. No doubt. 17 Q. Would you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had 18 Mr. Trump not signed off? 19 A. No, ma'am. 20 Q. Why not? 21 A. Because I wanted to ensure that I was going to get my 22 funds back. 23 Q. And as you sit here, do you have any doubt in your mind 24 that Donald Trump also said that he would make sure that you got 25 paid back?

4188 1 A. He said that.

2 Q. Would you have made the payment if he did not? 3 A. No, ma'am. 6 Davidson on October 26, 2017? That's People's Exhibit 265 in 7 evidence. 8 Have you had a chance to listen to that recording? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Have you had a chance to also review the transcript of 11 that call which is People's 267 in evidence? 12 A. I don't recall if I did. 13 Q. You don't recall one way or the other, correct? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Well, let's do this, let's play 15 the clip then for the jury, please, People's Exhibit 265. 16 Let's play a portion of the clip from 11 minutes and 13 17 seconds to 13 minutes and about 4 seconds.

18 We can put up a transcript while you are 19 listening. 20 Q. Let us know if the transcript is accurate in terms 21 of what you hear on the call. 24 We need someone to let us allow it to play. We 25 are having a little bit of a technical difficulty. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: The transcript is People's Exhibit 23 267 and the call is People's Exhibit 265.

4 Q. Now, Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review the 5 audio recording of one of your telephone calls with Keith 4189 1 Are you able to play it? Can you make it louder 2 on your end? 3 Thank you. 4 I think we're having an issue. 5 Can we take a break and see if we can fix it? 6 THE COURT: All right, jurors, I apologize. Let's 7 take a short break. 8 (Jury leaving courtroom.) 9 ***
10 THE COURT: You may be seated. 11 You can step out. 12 (Witness leaving courtroom.) 13 *** 14 (Recess.) 15 (Witness entering courtroom.) 16 *** 17 (Jury entering courtroom.)
18 *** 19 THE COURT: Please be seated. 20 THE CLERK: The jury is present and properly 21 seated. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, Judge. 23 Can we now play the clip from People's Exhibit 24 265? 25 (Whereupon, audio clip was played in open court.

4190 1 THE COURT: One second.

9 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 2 Are you supposed to have a transcript? 3 MS. HOFFINGER: I think the transcript is supposed 4 to be on the screen. 5 THE WITNESS: It is not. 6 Now it is. 7 (Whereupon, audio recording played in open court 8 and the transcript was displayed.)
11 (Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter, was relieved by Laurie Eisenberg as Senior Court Reporter.

12 4191

26 25 A Yes, ma'am.

28 Senior Court Reporter
1 M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger 2 1 (Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open 3 2 court and an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
4 3 Q Mr. Cohen, does that transcript accurately reflect 5 4 the conversation you had on the phone, that conversation with 6 5 Mr. Davidson?

7 6 A Yes, ma'am.

8 7 Q What did you mean when you told Keith Davidson, "I
9 8 can't even tell you how many times he said to me, 'I hate the 10 9 fact that we did it,' and my comment was, 'Every person you've 11 10 spoken to told you it was the right move;'" who were you 12 11 referring to? What were you referring to? What was it about?

13 12 A I was referring to the payment to Keith Davidson that 14 13 I made on behalf of Mr. Trump for the Stormy Daniels matter, 15 14 for the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

16 15 Q Who was it you were referring to when you said that, 17 16 "He said to me, 'I hate the fact that we did it;'" who was the 18 17 "he"?

19 18 A Mr. Trump.

20 19 Q Now, at the time of this call, which was October of 21 20 2017, were you still in the process of being repaid monthly by 22 21 checks --
23 22 A Yes.

24 23 Q -- from Mr. Trump for the $130,000 payoff to Stormy 25 24 Daniels?

4192 1 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

2 Q And you were Personal Attorney to President Trump at 3 the time? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Now, Defense Counsel has asked you a lot of questions 6 about how you've profited off of writing books and speaking 7 publicly in podcasts about Mr. Trump. 9 A I do.

10 Q Putting aside financial matters, putting that to 11 the side, how has telling the truth about what you did with 12 Mr. Trump affected your life, just briefly? 13 A My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct 14 result. My -- I lost my law license, my businesses, my 15 financial security, which I was fortunate enough early to have 16 been able to retain my family's happiness, which is probably 17 paramount, just to name a few.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: One moment, please. 19 (Whereupon, the People confer.)
20 Q Have there been certain attacks that you faced as a 21 result?

22 A Yes, ma'am. 23 Q Personal attacks? 24 A Yes, ma'am.

25 Q Without describing them, have there been any affects 8 Do you remember those questions?

4193 1 on both you and your family?

2 A Very much. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: I have nothing further. 4 RECROSS-EXAMINATION
5 BY MR. BLANCHE: 6 Q Mr. Cohen, you were asked a question a minute ago 7 about your life being turned upside-down because you decided to 8 change your view about Mr. Trump; right? 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

13 Q You were just asked questions about the consequences 14 of your conduct; correct? 17 A Correct.

18 Q Is that President Trump's fault? 19 A In part.

16 Q And you said that you lost your law license; right? 15 A Yes. 20 Q You pled guilty to tax crimes; correct? 21 A I did.

22 Q And you pled guilty to making false statements to a 23 bank; correct? 24 A As I previously said, yes.

25 Q Did President Trump have anything to do with that?

10 THE COURT: Sustained. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Sustained?

12 THE COURT: Sustained.

4194 1 A No, sir.

2 Q And is one of the reasons why you lost your license to 3 practice law because of those felonies? 4 A No. Not because of those.

5 Because of the totality, including the campaign finance 6 violations, two counts, as well as the U.S.C., the 1001, lying 7 to Congress. 8 Q So, "the totality". 9 So, my question to you: Is one of the reasons that you lost 10 your license to practice law because of those tax crimes and 11 because of the false statements to a bank; correct?

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Asked and answered. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 Q As a matter of fact, when you're convicted of a felony 17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q But, you still blame President Trump "in part" you 19 said because of that; is that right?

20 A Correct. 21 Q Now, if we can put up the Waiver that you were shown 22 on redirect, 417B, I believe. 23 Can you take a look at that when it shows up on your 24 screen.

25 MR. BLANCHE: This can be shown to everybody. It's 15 in New York, no matter the felony, you automatically lose your 16 license to practice law; correct?

4195 1 in evidence.

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 3 Q That's the Waiver that you were just shown on 4 redirect; correct?

5 A Correct. 6 Q This is a Waiver that you signed when you were talking 7 to the SDNY Prosecutors; correct? 8 A Correct.

18 A Correct. 19 Q -- "are subject to attorney-client privilege, I hereby 20 waive whatever attorney-client or other privilege that might be 21 argued to have attached to such communications."
22 You signed that; right? 23 A I did. 24 Q Earlier this morning, you said that you understood 25 that your communications with Mr. Costello were privileged; 9 Q It was to allow them to speak with Mr. Costello about 10 conversations that Mr. Costello had had with you; right? 11 A Correct.

12 MR. BLANCHE: If we can turn to the second page. 13 Just blow up the top ten lines, please. 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screen.)
15 Q You write: "Although I do not believe that any of my 16 communications with Costello or other lawyers at DHC" -- which 17 is Mr. Costello's law firm?

4196 1 right?

2 A At the time, yes. 3 Q When you made that; correct? 4 A (No response).

5 Q Meaning, when you had communication with Mr. Costello, 6 you thought it was privileged; right?

7 A My communications with Mr. Costello that were sent to 10 Q So, when you write here when you signed this Waiver 11 and said you don't believe that any of the communications with 12 Costello are subject to the attorney-client privilege, that's 13 different than what your testimony is today; is that right? 14 A No, sir. I think it's the same.

15 Q Today, you don't believe any of your communications 16 were privileged?

17 A To the extent that they were, I was waiving them.

18 But, at the time, I did not believe them to be. I was 19 appeasing what Mr. Costello --
20 Q At which time did you not believe them to be 21 privileged, at the time that you signed the Waiver or the time 22 you were talking to Mr. Costello? 23 A The time I signed the Waiver. 24 Q So, at the time you were talking to Mr. Costello, you 25 believed they were privileged?

8 me contained attorney-client privilege. And so, yes, I accepted 9 it for what he wanted.

4197 1 A I accepted that he wanted them to be attorney-client 2 privilege. 3 Q So, do you -- you were just asked a couple of 4 questions about a photograph of a rally on October 25th.

5 Do you remember those questions just a few minutes ago? 6 A I do.

7 Q That showed then-Candidate Trump with Keith Schiller; 13 A Correct. 14 Q I misspoke.

15 Now, Mr. Schiller, at the time, was the bodyguard of 16 President Trump; correct?

17 A Correct.

18 Q And as his bodyguard, did he travel with him, more or 19 less, every day during the campaign?

20 A Yes, sir. 21 Q So, if there was a rally, no matter the day, no matter 22 the time, Mr. Schiller would be there; correct? 23 A Correct. 24 Q And so, when that rally ended around eight o'clock, 25 your testimony is still -- just so I understand -- is still 8 is that right? 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection to the date.

10 You said 25th. 11 Q Sorry.

12 October 24th of 2016; correct?

4198 1 that in that 90 seconds, you spoke with Mr. Schiller about the 2 problem you were having with a 14-year-old, got him to agree to 3 take care of it, told him you would send him the number, which 4 you did, but also have Mr. Schiller pass the phone to Candidate 5 Trump and update Mr. Trump on everything that was going on; 6 that's your testimony?

7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q Got it.

12 Do you remember that question and that answer? 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 14 THE COURT: Sustained.

15 Q Well, did you -- did you lie to Congress in -- on 16 February 27, 2019?

17 A No, sir.

18 Q When you testified and when you wrote in your 19 statement that you never asked for, nor would you accept a 20 pardon from President Trump, you're saying that was not a lie? 21 A No, sir.

22 Q So, in 2016, you made $425,000 from The Trump 23 Organization; correct? 24 A (No response).

25 Q What I mean by that, your base salary, plus you only 9 So, early on in redirect, Ms. Hoffinger said that when you 10 spoke this morning about lying to Congress in connection with 11 the 2019 testimony, you misspoke.

4199 1 got a $50,000 bonus; correct?

2 A Correct. 3 Q So, that's $425,000; right? 4 A Correct, sir. 7 Q 35,000 a month; correct?

11 President Trump's Personal Attorney the entire year of 2017; 12 correct? 13 A Correct. 14 Q Now -- but your testimony is that the $420,000, the 15 $35,000 per month retainer or payment that you received was not 16 for your legal services; it was to pay back the money that 17 President Trump owed you; right?

18 A Yes. I've classified it as a reimbursement. 19 Q It was a reimbursement? It wasn't a payment for your 20 services? 21 A Correct.

22 Q So, in all, you worked for President Trump, I believe 23 you said, for around 11 years; correct? 24 A Correct.

25 Q Did he overpay for things regularly?

5 Q In 2017, you were paid $420,000; correct? 6 A Correct.

8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q And I know that you were saying that that was just a 10 repayment, but during that time, to be clear, you were 4200 1 A No, sir.

2 Q Did he happily write checks to lawyers, for example? 3 A No, sir. 4 Q One of the first things that you said you had to do 5 when you started working at The Trump Organization was to bring 6 a lot of bills down, and I think you said 20 percent is what 7 folks got paid; right? 8 A No. 9 What you're referring to was for Trump University where 10 people accepted 20 percent. 11 It's different than for the legal fees.

12 Q Oh. Understood. 13 Sorry. Legal fees is one thing. 14 This is different vendors that were owed money for Trump 15 University; correct? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And you made phone calls; and every time you got one 18 of them to pay just 20 percent, you said you had marched into 19 President Trump's office and you told him, you reported --
20 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 21 THE COURT: Sustained.

22 Q My question is -- and you understand that in 2016, 23 when he was running for election, he spent somewhere around 24 70 million of his own money on the campaign; correct?

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

4201 2 Q So, of all the time, the 11 years that you worked for 3 President Trump, do you recall him -- except for the payment 4 that we're talking about now, the 420,000 -- do you recall him 5 ever just willingly overpaying for something? 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: Overruled. 9 A No. That's the first time that I recall Mr. Trump 10 paying for any NDA. 11 Q That's when he repaid you or reimbursed you, according 12 to your testimony, the $130,000; correct? 13 A Along with the other items, yes. 14 Q Along with the other 20,000 for Red Finch; correct?

15 A Well, it's not 20, but -- yes. 16 Q It was 20. You charged him 50.

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. 19 MR. BLANCHE: I have no more questions, Judge.

20 THE COURT: Anything else? 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Nothing, Judge.

22 THE COURT: Thank you, sir. 23 You can step down. 24 THE WITNESS: Thank you.

25 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
8 You can answer.

4202 1 THE COURT: People?

2 MR. STEINGLASS: Your Honor, the People rest. 3 THE COURT: Counsel, please approach. 4 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 5 at sidebar:)
17 yes.

18 THE COURT: To the extent we can finish at 4:45 19 or 5:00, we can do that.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: We need cross of Mr. Costello. 21 THE COURT: That's why I'm saying if you need to 22 go longer, I'm willing to do that. 23 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 24 in open court:)
25 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, does the Defense wish to 7 ask you in the presence of the jury whether you intend to 8 present any evidence. 9 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

10 We also move for an immediate acquittal. 11 We can do that at the end of the day.

12 I don't want to take the jury's time. 13 We anticipate calling two witnesses. The first, 14 our paralegal, five minutes or so; and then Mr. Costello.

15 THE COURT: Do you think you'll be done by 4:30? 16 MR. BLANCHE: If Mr. Steinglass talks quickly, 6 THE COURT: I wanted to confirm with you before I
1 present any evidence?

2 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 3 The Defense calls Daniel Sitko. 4 D A N I E L S I T K O, having first been duly sworn and/or 6 follows:
9 THE WITNESS: Daniel Sitko. S-I-T-K-O.

10 COURT OFFICER: County of residence. 11 THE WITNESS: New York.

12 DIRECT EXAMINATION 13 BY MR. BLANCHE: 14 Q Good afternoon.

15 Where do you work? 16 A I work for Blanche Law.

17 Q You work for me?

18 A I do. 19 Q You're a paralegal?

20 A I am. 21 Q You've been in court.

22 Generally speaking, what is your job? 23 A Um, I assist attorneys in whatever comes up. A lot of 24 it, as a defense firm, is reviewing discovery, which is 25 evidence produced in a case, summarizing it, helping with 4203 8 record, spelling your last name. 7 COURT OFFICER: State your full name for the 5 affirmed by the court clerk, was examined and testified as 4204 1 filings, researching stuff, editing motions.

2 Q This past Friday, so three days ago, after trial ended 3 on Thursday, were you asked to do anything? 4 A Yes. I was asked to create a Summary Chart of phone 5 calls.

7 A So, I looked in the People's Exhibit 400 for the phone 8 logs for Mr. Cohen's phone number ending 0114. I looked for 9 contacts or -- contact between that phone number and three 10 phone numbers associated with Robert Costello. 11 So, anyone that may have appeared in that phone log, I
12 would copy and paste certain information, like the time the 13 phone call was made, how long the phone call lasted, the date, 14 into an Excel spreadsheet.

15 Q So, you created an Excel spreadsheet? 16 A Yes. 21 Q Is this the Excel spreadsheet you created?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Does it accurately reflect, with the exception of 24 redactions, the information that you reviewed from the phone 25 records you just described?

19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 20 the witness and the parties.)
6 Q What did you do to accomplish that task?

17 Q I'm going to show you, the Court, and the parties what 18 I marked for identification as B101A.

4205 1 A Yes.

2 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we offer B101A, a 3 Summary Chart. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.

5 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 6 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit B101A is received in 7 evidence.) 8 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put that on the screen. 9 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
10 Q Looking at the top of the first page, can you just 11 explain the Call Summary and walk through the headers, 12 Mr. Sitko? 13 A Sure. 14 So, at the top, it was the two participants that we -- that 15 I culled the calls for, one being Mr. Cohen and the second 16 being Mr. Costello.

17 Right below his name on the right side of the page is a 18 number that appeared in Mr. Costello's email signature on 19 People's Exhibit -- I think it was, um, 206 and 204. I might 20 have the numbers a little wrong. But, associated with his law 21 firm.

22 The first column on the left is "Call Number". That just is 23 a way to keep track of which call in the chart we're referring 24 to.

25 Second is "Date".

4206 1 Um, the third is the time that the call was made in the 2 call logs. I adjusted that from -- on the call logs it appeared 3 in UTC. I adjusted it to be 12-hour time and also Eastern Time. 4 The fourth column is call "Duration".

5 The fifth and sixth columns are the identity that 6 correspond to the seventh and eighth columns, which is the 7 redacted phone numbers that appeared in the call logs. 8 I got those identities, um, again, from the exhibits 9 that have been admitted, including numbers that appeared in 10 Mr. Costello's email signature. 11 Q It looks like the first call, for example, the 12 duration is 0000. 13 Is that true of a handful of the calls? 14 A Yes.

15 Q Do you have an understanding of what that means? 16 A That means that the call was not answered. 21 including the ones that went unanswered?

22 A Seventy-five, in total. 23 Q Did you know whether there were several calls that 24 were longer than half an hour?

25 A Yes.

17 MR. BLANCHE: So, if we can back this out and go 18 to the end of this chart. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20 Q Do you know how many calls there were, in total, 4207 1 I believe there were six calls that were longer than half 2 an hour. 3 MR. BLANCHE: If we can back this out and go to 4 call 48.

5 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.) 6 Q That just means, Mr. Sitko, that's the 48th call 7 between the Costello numbers and Mr. Cohen. 8 A Yeah. That's the 48th call that appeared in the call 9 logs.

10 Q The 48th call appears to be on May 27th, and it 11 appears to last 96 minutes, from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Costello?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Do you know what day that was, May 27th, 2018? 14 A May 28th was Memorial Day. So, this would be the 16 Day weekend.

17 Q And then, separately, do you know what day Labor Day 18 was in 2016? 19 A Yeah.

20 So, Labor Day was September 5th in 2016. 21 Q Okay.

22 MR. BLANCHE: I have no further questions, your 23 Honor. 24 THE COURT: Your witness.

25 MS. MANGOLD: Thank you, your Honor.

15 Sunday before that, the day before Memorial Day. So, Memorial 4208 1 CROSS-EXAMINATION
2 BY MS. MANGOLD: 3 Q Good afternoon, Mr. Sitko. 4 A Good afternoon.

5 Q You and I have encountered each other before; right? 6 A Yeah. We've seen each other.

7 Q We worked on the same case?

19 A That's correct.

20 MS. MANGOLD: Can we pull up Exhibit E1018 for 21 the parties on the screen.

22 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q The Defense team has had the records contained in 24 People's 400 since mid-2023; right?

25 A Yes.

8 A Yes. 9 Q And you created this chart in Defense Exhibit B101A
10 based on the underlying phone records? 11 A Yes. In People's Exhibit 400.

12 Q And within People's Exhibit 400, you said you pulled 13 the records for Mr. Cohen's phone number ending 0114; right? 14 A That's correct.

15 Q Those records are provided by AT&T? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Those AT&T records are already in evidence, but 18 they're under seal; right?

4209 1 Q All right.

2 MS. MANGOLD: Can you please zoom in on the top 3 third of the page. 4 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
5 Q Do you see the rows indicated there that it says the 6 caller is DHC?

10 A It does. 11 Q Is there a way to tell, based on those phone records, 12 who at DHC was the caller, or is that just the general firm 13 line? 14 A It's the general firm line.

15 From the records, there would be no way to tell who, 16 specifically, made those calls.

17 Q And looking now at -- I think Mr. Blanche noted that 20 A Yes. That's correct. 21 Q And you said those are instances where the call was 22 not answered; right? 23 A Yes. That's my understanding. 24 Q And do you remember when Mr. Blanche asked Mr. Cohen 25 on cross: Would it surprise you to learn that you actually 18 there are -- we can zoom back out -- a number of entries in the 19 chart where the duration is 0000?

8 Q Is that -- does that correspond to the notation at the 9 top of the chart for Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP? 7 A Yes.

4210 1 communicated on the phone, either Mr. Cohen calling 2 Mr. Costello or Mr. Costello was calling Mr. Cohen, up to 75 3 times? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And is that 75 number based on this chart you 6 prepared?

7 A Yes. 8 Q Now, looking at the originating number --
18 Q Okay. 19 Do you see where there's a line that says 0000, DHC, that 20 top row right there from 4-16-2018? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Just below that, with almost the exact same timestamp, 23 I believe -- so, the first call, zero minutes is timestamp 24 under 4:34:26; and the following call, dated the same time, has

25 a timestamp of 4:34:27; right?
9 MS. MANGOLD: We can zoom in on the top. Maybe 10 row 12. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 MS. MANGOLD: Just for the record, I'll note that 13 I believe what we've put up now might be an earlier 14 version of the exhibit that we received without row 15 numbers. 16 Q Mr. Sitko, is that consistent with your understanding?

17 A Yes. I believe so.

1 A Yes.

4211 2 Q That indicates that that call was 45 seconds; right?

3 A Yes. 4 Q And then on the right, where it has the originating 5 number, it has both the 7200 number, which is the law firm's 6 main number; right?

7 A Yes.

8 Q And then there's a second number below that, 3595; 9 right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Do you know what that number indicates?

12 A I -- my understanding is that number indicates that 13 was forwarded to a voicemail, and that's a number associated 14 with a voicemail inbox. 15 Q So, is that a voicemail that was left after the 17 A Yes. I believe so.

18 Q Okay. 19 So, there are certain calls on this chart that are double 20 counted; right? 21 There's first -- like the one we're looking at here, the 22 first one with the missed call, that gets its own row. Then, 23 the second one is the voice call for that same call. 24 So, it's really just one call? 25 A Yeah. 16 previous -- as part of that same call indicated above?

4212 1 Q And I believe your paralegal testified that these are 2 made from how the call bounces off of AT&T towers? 3 A Yes. 4 Q That's how the records are displayed in AT&T records?

5 A Yes. 6 Q But, there are 75 rows in the chart; right?

7 A Yes. 8 Q So, are all of those 75 rows separate times that 9 Mr. Cohen's number connected with Mr. Costello's number?

10 Is your understanding there was an actual conversation, or 11 could it be a missed call, a voicemail, or an actual connection 12 between the two?

18 A Conversations, yes. Certainly. 19 MS. MANGOLD: I have no further questions.

20 THE COURT: Anything further? 21 MR. BLANCHE: No redirect.

22 THE COURT: Thank you.

13 A Yeah. So if Mr. Cohen and Mr. Costello had made a push 14 call, it could be reflected in two different lines on this for 15 the same call. 16 Q So, the total number of conversations, that was less 17 than 75?

23 You can step down. 24 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
25 THE COURT: Your next witness, please.

4213 1 MR. BLANCHE: The Defense calls Robert Costello.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: We need to approach before. 3 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 4 at sidebar:)
5 MS. HOFFINGER: The general rule is extrinsic 10 The general rule is, you can't admit the witness 11 on credibility.

12 You're stuck with the witness' answers. 13 In the alternative, if what they're doing is 14 saying there are some prior inconsistent statements, 15 meaning that Mr. Costello is going to offer two prior 16 inconsistent statements by Mr. Cohen, the testimony would 17 be limited just to those two statements.

18 I say "two statements" because I've taken a look 19 at the transcripts. I've taken a look at the transcripts, 20 and there are only two questions where Mr. Cohen said he 21 didn't recall. That was the extent of it.

22 Everything else, he admitted each and every 23 question that Mr. Blanche put to him with respect to 24 Mr. Costello.

25 We don't think Mr. Costello's testimony should be 6 evidence by way of witness testimony is not permitted on 7 collateral matters. 8 My understanding is they're calling him purely on 9 matters of credibility with respect to Mr. Cohen.

4214 1 admitted. But, if it is, it should be limited only to 2 those two statements. 3 MR. BOVE: We, respectfully, disagree. 4 This testimony is being offered, in part, to 5 admit prior inconsistent statements through the testimony. 6 But, more importantly, it's being offered to 7 rebut the Government's theory of a pressure campaign by 8 President Trump in 2018. 9 We moved prior to trial to preclude that 10 evidence. It came in; we understand. 11 So, we're offering this as a significant part of 12 our defense, to rebut the suggestion from Mr. Cohen that 13 his interactions with Bob Costello were some kind of way 14 for President Trump to get to him, to apply pressure.

15 That was the general thrust of his testimony. He 16 said that in specifics. They offered emails about this.

17 So, Mr. Costello is going to explain his 18 relationship with Michael Cohen, from his perspective, to 19 rebut the Government's theory on this issue.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: This is really about Michael 21 Cohen's state of mind. That's the purpose of what you 24 He said repeatedly he did not tell the truth to 25 Mr. Costello. At no time did he tell him why.

22 admitted it for, which is why he didn't tell the truth for 23 a very long time.

4215 10 timeframe, and that he very much wanted to be in touch 11 with Rudy Giuliani, to put questions to the President, to 12 try to extract information about the investigation. 13 This is very much a rebuttal of what the 14 Government believed, before they opened, was an important 15 part of their case. 16 And it also goes to the credibility of the star 17 witness.

18 And it's admissible for all these reasons. 19 I understand, I would expect with any witness we 20 take it question by question to some extent. 21 Generally speaking, our theory of admissibility 22 is to rebut this pressure campaign concept and to put 23 into evidence that whatever is being said today about 24 Mr. Cohen's state of mind, what he said was his state of 25 mind in 2018 was false, because Mr. Costello will say it's 1 So, your Honor said that that evidence would not 2 be permitted for consciousness of guilt for Mr. Trump. 3 What we're talking about here is Mr. Cohen's 4 state of mind, and you ruled that that was admissible for 5 that purpose. 6 MR. BOVE: Our position -- and we're seeking to 7 bring this out through the testimony of Mr. Costello -- is 8 that Mr. Cohen lied about his interactions with Bob 9 Costello, and he lied about his state of mind in this 1 false.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Mr. Cohen admitted he reached out 3 to Rudy Giuliani. 4 What it's being admitted for is to rebut the 5 credibility of Mr. Cohen. 6 It's not admissible for that purpose. He's not 7 entitled to elicit opinion testimony about the credibility 8 of Mr. Cohen. 9 THE COURT: We should have discussed this before.

10 I'm going to excuse the jury. 11 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 12 in open court:) 13 THE COURT: I apologize. I'll ask you to step 14 outside for a few minutes.

15 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 18 this earlier.

17 THE COURT: Again, I do wish we had discussed 19 People, let me hear your objections, your 20 concerns. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Sure.

22 Your Honor, again, to say that -- Mr. Costello, 23 it appears, is being brought in to provide extrinsic 24 evidence to rebut a witness' testimony on collateral 25 matters; and the general rule is that you're stuck with 4216 16 are excused.)
4217 1 the witness' answer on those matters that affect solely 2 credibility.

13 didn't recall. All he said was that he didn't recall. 14 He didn't recall Mr. Costello telling him in the 15 first meeting that he could or should cooperate against 16 President Trump.

17 He didn't recall -- he didn't recall the words, 18 saying that he didn't -- that he said to Mr. Costello he 19 had nothing on President Trump.

20 But, you will recall that he testified several 21 times that he did not tell the truth to Mr. Costello.

22 He absolutely did not tell the truth. He knew it 23 would get back to Mr. Trump through Mr. Giuliani. 24 So, I think there's very little testimony that 25 would be permissible, if at all.

5 Mr. Cohen, then we would say if his testimony is admitted, 6 which we believe it should not be, if it's admitted, it 7 needs to be limited and restricted only to those prior 8 inconsistent statements. 9 They're not entitled to elicit from Mr. Costello 10 his opinions about Mr. Cohen's credibility. 11 They should be restricted just to the two 12 questions, frankly, that Mr. Cohen testified that he 3 To the extent that defense is offering statements 4 by Mr. Costello as prior inconsistent statements of 4218 1 We move for the testimony to be precluded. But, 2 if it's admitted, it should be on a very narrow basis. 3 MR. BOVE: As I said at sidebar, this testimony, 13 evidence prior to trial. 14 The Government put it in.

15 We provided notice days ago of our intention to 16 put Mr. Costello on.

17 There's no mystery here.

18 What we're seeking to do is to counter that 12 We opposed the offer of all of that type of 10 Mr. Costello in a privileged setting would get back to the 11 President.

8 Michael Cohen's testimony that he was too concerned about 9 the possibility that information that he provided to 4 to me, is being offered to rebut the Government's argument 5 about a supposed pressure campaign from President Trump. 6 And I think you just heard a little bit about it, 7 which is that it's the Government's theory and it was 19 evidence.

20 I'm not going to elicit -- of course I'm not 21 going to elicit Mr. Costello's opinion of Mr. Cohen's 22 credibility. 23 I am seeking to elicit many facts about the way 24 that their engagement worked between April of '17 and the 25 Summer of -- excuse me -- April of 2018 and the Summer of 1 2018 that bear on things that Mr. Cohen said.

4219 3 them. 2 For example, he said: I never agreed to retain 4 This issue about: I was concerned that I couldn't 5 say things because they would get back to the President. 6 The idea that Mr. Costello was pestering him, 7 instead of it being the other way around. 8 All these issues, we didn't bring it up. We 9 didn't think this should be admissible. They brought it 10 up. 11 Now we're seeking to offer evidence to respond to 12 an argument they made in their opening and they put in 13 through Mr. Cohen. 14 In terms of prior inconsistent statement 15 evidence, what I expect Mr. Costello to say is different 16 from what Michael Cohen said.

17 What Michael Cohen suggested is he sat at the 18 Regency Hotel, at this meeting with Mr. Costello and Jeff 19 Citron, and omitted information because he was concerned 20 if he said certain things, they would get back to the 21 President.

22 That's not Mr. Costello's recollection of that 23 conversation at all. 24 What Mr. Costello recalls is Mr. Cohen saying 25 President Trump did not know about the statement -- excuse 4220 1 me -- the payment to Stephanie Clifford.

2 That's extremely probative of the core issues in 3 this case. It's not collateral at all. It goes to the 4 heart of the Government's theory.

5 So, both in terms of evidence of prior 6 inconsistent statements that we will be offering through 11 You know, I understand the objections.

12 THE COURT: You don't think the pressure campaign 13 theory is collateral? 14 MR. BOVE: Not at all, Judge.

15 They didn't just ask a guy questions about this. 16 They put in exhibits. They asked how the relationship 17 went.

18 The whole purpose of this was to make President 19 Trump sound threatening, to make it sound like he was 20 interfering with the investigation. 21 THE COURT: I don't think so.

22 I think the reason for it was to explain why at 23 one point he said one thing and at another point he said 24 something else.

25 That doesn't go to the elements of your defense.

7 Mr. Costello -- that's somewhat limited -- and, also, I 8 think, more importantly, to rebut the Government's 9 pressure campaign theory. That's why this testimony is 10 admissible.

4221 8 Mr. Costello, the Government suggested to this jury that 9 President Trump was tampering with this witness. That is 10 their theory of what the pressure campaign was. 11 They elicited from Mr. Cohen how he felt about 12 these things as they're going on. 13 We -- 14 THE COURT: How can Mr. Costello testify as to 15 what Mr. Cohen felt? 16 MR. BOVE: He can't.

17 He can testify about what Mr. Cohen said and what 18 Mr. Cohen did.

20 even witnesses who were not a party to a communication 21 were allowed to offer a lay witness opinion --
22 THE COURT: For state of mind, yes. 23 MR. BOVE: So, in that sense, that witness' 24 opinion is admissible with respect to Mr. Cohen's state of 25 mind, in the same way it's admissible with respect to any 1 It doesn't go to your client's guilt or innocence, 2 necessarily. 3 It goes to the credibility of Mr. Cohen. 4 MR. BOVE: Judge, for the Government to be 5 suggesting -- they're basically suggesting that it 6 includes, through that Tweet in I believe it's April 2017, 7 that they juxtaposed against email traffic with 19 There's many, many examples at this trial where 4222 1 other time.

2 THE COURT: I disagree Mr. Costello can testify 3 to Mr. Cohen's state of mind. 4 I'll consider some of your other arguments.

5 I disagree with that. 6 MR. BOVE: Mr. Costello can testify what he 7 understood communications to be. That's all I'm saying. 8 In the same way many other witnesses at this 9 trial have done.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: I think you have our point at 11 this point.

12 The only other piece is that rebutting the 13 so-called pressure campaign, which, as your Honor knows, 14 that was not our purpose in putting this in; it was for 15 Michael Cohen's state of mind and why he didn't tell the 16 truth for a long time.

17 Rebutting the pressure campaign should be part of 18 their direct case. It's not impeachment. 19 They didn't put this witness on their witness 20 list as a direct witness. 21 We didn't get, for example, exhibits that we were 22 supposed to get. 23 We got them recently in terms of Mr. Cohen; and 24 they might use them with Mr. Costello, too.

25 We heard this morning he was coming. They let us 4223 1 know a couple of days ago he might.

2 That's direct, not impeachment. 3 The question is whether he's allowed for prior 4 inconsistent statements.

5 I suggest anything else, Retainer Agreements, 14 testimony that there was never an agreement, even verbal, 15 that Mr. Costello would represent him. 16 Things like that, where Mr. Costello is providing 17 direct evidence of perjury at this trial, are never 18 collateral, Judge. 19 That's what we're seeking to lay out.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: It's entirely collateral, your 21 Honor.

22 MR. BOVE: That he committed perjury is 23 collateral? 24 THE COURT: I'm going to take five minutes.

25 Don't leave the courtroom.

6 whether he paid him, or anything else that's lateral and 7 collateral, he shouldn't be testifying to that. 8 If it's a prior inconsistent statement, his 9 attention should be drawn to the exact statement, and his 10 testimony should be limited to that. 11 MR. BOVE: Part of what Mr. Costello is going to 12 do is explain that certain things that Cohen testified 13 about at this trial were false. Things like Cohen's 4224 1 (Whereupon, the Court exits the courtroom, and a 2 pause is taken in the proceedings.) 3 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 4 relieves Senior Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript 5 continues on the following page.) 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 4225 1 (The following proceedings continue from the 2 preceding page.)
3 ******** 4 (Whereupon, the Court resumes the bench and the 5 proceedings continue.) 6 THE COURT: So, Mr. Bove, you can definitely 7 cross-examine as to the two prior inconsistent statements, 8 obviously. 9 And I will give you some latitude to explore the 10 pressure campaign so that you can elicit some 11 inconsistencies, so you can offer some rebuttal of 12 Mr. Cohen's testimony.

13 But I'm not going to allow this to become a trial 14 within a trial as to whether or not there was, in fact, this 15 pressure campaign and how it affected Cohen. 16 That's not the purpose of this trial, and I don't 17 want it to become that.

18 As far as the retainer issue, that's collateral. 19 We don't need to go into that at all. 20 Okay. All right. Let's get the jury, please. 21 MR. BOVE: Should we get the witness first, Judge?

22 THE COURT: No. The witness has not yet been sworn 23 in. 24 THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. Jury entering. 25 (Jury enters.)

18 A I'm sorry? 19 Q Where do you work? 20 A I'm a partner in a law firm of Davidoff Hutcher & 21 Citron. 22 Q How long have you been at that firm? 23 A About seven years.

5 THE COURT OFFICER: Spell your last name.

1 A I did.

4228 2 Q When, approximately, was that?

3 A 1975 to 1982. 4 Q And describe your service for the jury, please. 5 A I was an Assistant United States Attorney in the 6 Southern District of New York, right down the block.

7 I was in '81 and '82, I was Deputy Chief of the Criminal 8 Division there. 9 Q And so, you were a Federal Prosecutor in Manhattan; 10 right? 11 A Yes, I was.

12 Q Do you know somebody named Michael Cohen?

13 A I do. 14 Q When, approximately, did you meet Cohen? 18 Q Where was the meeting? 19 A At the Regency Hotel in Manhattan. And I was 20 accompanied by Jeff Citron, one of my law partners, who knew 21 Mr. Cohen.

22 Q Now, did you consider your conversation at the 23 Regency Hotel that day to be subject of the attorney-client 24 privilege? 25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 15 A I met him exactly on April 17th, 2018. 16 Q Did you meet with him in person that day?

17 A I did.

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

4229 2 A Absolutely. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 4 THE COURT: Sustained. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Can the answer be stricken? 7 Q Who was at the meeting at the Regency Hotel? 8 A Michael Cohen, Jeffrey Citron and myself. 9 Q Did the topic of potential cooperation come up?

10 A Yes, it did. 11 Q What was discussed? 12 A Well, first Michael Cohen explained his situation, 13 because I had never met Cohen before, so I had no idea what was 14 going on, that his home and his law office had been searched 15 pursuant to a search warrant. 16 And he was absolutely manic at the beginning and throughout 17 the two hours of that meeting; marching back and forth; pacing.

18 We were in a conference room on the second floor of the 19 Regency Hotel. 20 And he kept on pacing back and forth, left and right, while 21 myself and Jeff were seated. 22 And, after he explained what was going on, he said: My life 23 is shattered. My family's life is shattered. I don't know 24 what's going to happen. 25 He said: I really want you to explain to me what my options 6 THE COURT: And the answer is stricken.

1 are. What's my escape route?

4230 2 That's the phrase he used. 3 Q So, was cooperation one of the options that you 4 described in response to that question?

5 A Absolutely it was. 6 Q What did you tell Mr. Cohen that day?

7 A I explained to Mr. Cohen that when he described the 8 search warrants, I pointed out that a search warrant of a law 9 office is much more difficult to get than a search warrant of 10 any other place. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

12 THE COURT: Sustained. 13 Q What was your view that day about whether or not 14 Michael Cohen should cooperate?

15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained.

17 Q What instructions did you give Mr. Cohen with respect 18 to cooperation? 19 A Okay. I explained -- I explained to Mr. Cohen that it 20 was obvious that he was not the target of the search by the 21 Southern District of New York, that they thought that he had 22 committed some crimes -- 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 24 THE COURT: Sustained.

25 Q I just want to stay narrow on the topic of cooperation 4231 1 and the instructions that you gave Michael Cohen.

2 A Okay. 3 I explained to Michael Cohen that this entire legal problem 4 that he was facing would be resolved by the end of the week if 5 he had truthful information on Donald Trump and cooperated with 6 the Southern District of New York.

7 Q And what, if anything, did Michael Cohen say about 8 President Trump at that point in the meeting? 9 A He made the same statement that he made about 10 or 12 10 times that day; quote: "I swear to God, Bob. I don't have 11 anything on Donald Trump."
12 Q Did the topic of Stormy Daniels come up? 13 A It did. 14 Q What, if anything, did Cohen say about Stormy Daniels 15 during the meeting? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Overruled.

18 You can answer. 19 A He began by saying: "I don't understand why they're 20 trying to put me in jail for some F'ing NDAs," which is a 21 Non-Disclosure Agreement.

22 He then said, "I did an NDA with Stormy Daniels." 23 So, I asked him to tell me about what the circumstances 24 were, how was he involved.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

4232 1 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 Q Did Mr. Cohen say anything about President Trump in 5 connection with the Stormy Daniels part of the conversation? 6 A He did.

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

12 Q Did President Trump's family come up? 13 A Yes, it did. 14 Q What did Mr. Cohen say about President Trump's family?

15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 16 THE COURT: Sustained.

17 Please approach.

18 (At Sidebar:)
9 MR. BOVE: May I be heard, Judge?

10 THE COURT: No. 11 Please continue.

3 THE COURT: The last answer is stricken, yes. 2 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you strike the answer? 8 THE COURT: Sustained.

25 If he's going to be impeaching Mr. Cohen by prior 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Mr. Steinglass would like to be 21 heard.

22 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you. 23 Respectfully, this is exactly what you just told 24 him not to do.

19 ******
4233 7 he doesn't remember is impeachment by a prior inconsistent 8 statement by a collateral witness permitted. 9 There were two instances where that happened.

10 One, Mr. Bove just covered. 11 We are going way far afield of that.

12 This is not a general: Everything that Mr. Cohen 13 testified, did he tell you something different, did he tell 14 you something different, did he tell you something 15 different. 16 He would have had to confront Mr. Cohen with those 17 inconsistencies and say: Did you tell Mr. Costello, X, Y
18 and Z on this date, and then Cohen would have had to have 19 denied it; and then it would be permissible.

20 It is not permissible to have a wholesale of 21 everything that Mr. Cohen said --
22 MR. BOVE: That's not what I'm trying to do, 23 Judge. 24 I'm trying to get to the specific statement that 25 Cohen made that President Trump did not know about the 1 inconsistent statement, the law is extraordinarily clear on 2 this. 3 The witness' attention has to be specifically 4 called to the prior inconsistency, and he has to be given a 5 chance to explain it. 6 Only if he maintains the inconsistency or he says 4234 1 payment to Stormy Daniels, which is not --
2 THE COURT: Well, why don't you just get to that. 3 MR. BOVE: I'm trying. 5 you are asking these questions, and he's going off, and he 6 is telling a story. 7 And I am going to sustain the story. 8 MR. BOVE: May I lead him then? 9 May I lead?

10 THE COURT: Just get to the question that you want 11 to ask. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: One question you have -- one 13 question you've already gotten to. 14 There is only one more. 15 THE COURT: That's it. 16 (Sidebar concluded.) 17 *******
18 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 19 BY MR. BOVE: 20 Q Mr. Costello, we are still focused on the April 17th, 21 2018 meeting at the Regency. 22 And I want to focus very narrowly on whether Cohen said 23 anything about whether President Trump knew about the payment to 24 Stormy Daniels? 25 A Yes.

4 THE COURT: Because right now what's happening is 4235 1 Q What did he say about that specific topic?

2 A Michael Cohen said, numerous times, that President 3 Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his 4 own. 5 And he repeated that numerous times. 6 Q Was Rudy Giuliani discussed at this meeting? 7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 8 THE COURT: I will allow it. 9 You can answer.

10 A His name came up, very briefly. 11 Just in the fact that I had been a student assistant of his 12 back in the early '70s. 13 Other than that, we didn't discuss him. 14 MR. BOVE: I would like to bring up, Mr. Bernik, 15 Government Exhibit 203 in evidence. 16 If you can zoom in on the email, please. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q Do you see this email? 19 A I do. 20 Q And is this an email that you sent to Mr. Cohen two 21 days after the meeting on April 19th? 22 A That's correct. 23 Q Why did you send this email to him? 24 A Because it was announced that day in the newspapers 25 and on TV that Rudy Giuliani was joining Donald Trump's legal 4236 1 team.

2 MR. BOVE: And if we can take a look now at the 3 context around that email by bringing up Defense Exhibit 21 Q Do you see where Mr. Cohen wrote, "I have been working 22 with lawyers all day?" 23 A Correct. 24 Q What did you understand him to mean?

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

7 A Right, I see it. 8 (Displayed.) 9 Q Now, that's the same email we were just looking at; 10 correct? 11 A It is, yeah.

12 Q And, now, let's look at Mr. Cohen's response at 7:36 13 p.m. 14 (Displayed.)

2 You can answer. 3 A He was working with McDermott, Will & Emery, a 4 Washington law firm, and they were going over the evidence that 5 had been seized pursuant to the search warrants and, presumably, 6 they were selecting documents that might be claimed to be 7 attorney-client privilege or work-product privilege. 8 Q Did Mr. Cohen ever say anything to you about not being 9 able to retain you because he had retained the McDermott firm?

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 11 THE COURT: Sustained. 12 A Not directly, he complained --
19 record. 20 When I sustain an objection, you don't need to 21 answer it. 22 Q Did there come a time when there was a verbal -- 23 there was a conversation about retaining you between you and 24 Cohen? 25 A Sure. Many times.

14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: Sustained. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Can the answer be stricken from the 17 record, your Honor?

18 THE COURT: That answer is stricken from the 13 THE COURT: Sustained.

4238 1 Q I would like to focus on the period of around 2 April 19th and 20th of 2018. 3 Do you remember a conversation about retention? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, Judge.

5 A Not off the top of my head. 6 Q Well, what do you recall about this general topic?

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 8 THE COURT: Sustained. 9 A The issue was that --
21 (Displayed.)
22 A Right. I see that. 23 Q Now, this is a message that you sent to Michael Cohen 24 on April 21st; right?

25 A That is correct.

12 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Move to strike it. 14 THE COURT: The answer is stricken.

1 Q And do you see the subject line? It says "Giuliani."
2 A Yeah, "Giuliani;" right. 3 Q And in the message you wrote, "I just spoke to Rudy 4 Giuliani and told him I was on your team?" 5 A Yes, I did. 6 Q And Cohen instructed you to do that? 7 A He did.

11 A Yes. 12 Q Is that -- that term, "back channel," is that a term 13 that Mr. Giuliani used? 14 A Yes. 15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained. 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Move to strike, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Stricken. 19 Q What had Michael Cohen said to you about how to 20 communicate with Rudy Giuliani? 21 A He told me that I was authorized to tell Giuliani that 22 my firm was, quote, "on the team," that's the phrase that he 23 used, but that we weren't going -- he wasn't going to announce 24 it publicly, so although I could tell Giuliani and Giuliani 25 could tell anybody else associated with the President, he wasn't 10 and asked me to keep in touch?"
8 Q Do you see at the end of this email where it says, "He 9 said thank you for opening this back channel of communication 4240 3 Q And were there some times when -- 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 5 THE COURT: Overruled. 6 Q Were there some times when Michael Cohen instructed you 7 to ask questions of Rudy Giuliani? 8 A Correct. 9 Q What types of questions?

10 A He wanted to know how the investigation of Michael 11 Cohen began. 12 He wanted to know whether it was a referral from Washington. 13 How did it get to the Southern District of New York, which is 14 the Federal Court right down the street here. 15 And he wanted me to ask Giuliani if Giuliani knew. 16 Q So, Cohen was trying to get information from Rudy 17 Giuliani?

18 A That's correct. 19 MR. BOVE: Now, if we could take a look at Defense 20 Exhibit B1006 in evidence, please. 21 Can we zoom in on the header and email, please? 22 Thank you. 24 Q So, this is an email that you sent to Michael Cohen on 25 April 23rd, 2018.

1 supposed to tell the media, and that's why he used the term 2 "back channel."
23 (Displayed.)
4241 1 Do you see that?

2 A Yes, it was. 3 I do see it. 4 Q And do you see the subject line "Assignment?" 5 A Yes. 6 Q Were you reporting back on an assignment from Michael 7 Cohen? 8 A Yes. What he asked me to do; right. 9 Q And the email begins, "I spoke with the person you 10 asked me to." 11 Do you see that? 12 A Correct. 13 Q Who were you referring to? 14 A Rudy Giuliani. 15 Q And then it continues. 16 He said that he would find out exactly how the matter ended 17 up in SDNY and, in particular, who in Main Justice approved 18 this. 19 Do you see that? 20 A I do. 21 Q And is that something that Rudy Giuliani said to you in 22 response to Michael Cohen's question? 23 A It is. 24 Q I would like you to take a look at the second paragraph 25 of that email.

4242 1 Do you see where it says the question of "timing is 2 premature?" 3 A Yeah, I see that. 4 Q What did you mean by that?

5 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Sustained.

7 A Jeez. 8 Q Was that in response to something Michael Cohen had 19 please.

22 Mr. Costello, I want to -- I would like to discuss 23 proper decorum in my courtroom. 24 THE WITNESS: But -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.

21 You may be seated.

4243 1 courtroom.

2 THE WITNESS: Right. 3 THE COURT: Okay. 4 So, when there is a witness on the stand, if you 5 don't like my ruling, you don't say "Jeez," okay. 6 And then you don't say "strike it," because I'm the 7 only one that can strike testimony in the courtroom. 8 Do you understand that? 9 THE WITNESS: I understand.

10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 And then, if you don't like my ruling, you don't 12 give me side eye and you don't roll your eyes. 13 Do you understand that? 14 Do you understand that? 15 THE WITNESS: I understand that. I understand what 16 you're saying. 17 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

18 Let's get the jury back. 19 Are you staring me down right now? 20 THE WITNESS: No. I'm just wondering how -- 21 THE COURT: Clear the courtroom, please. Clear the 22 courtroom. 23 THE WITNESS: Do you want me to answer your 24 question? 25 THE SERGEANT: Sir, please.

4244 1 THE COURT OFFICER: Step outside, please.

2 Step out and step to the side, please. 3 Step out, please. 4 Quiet please. 5 Step out, please. 6 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: Your Honor, may I object 7 on behalf of the press? 8 Your Honor, our lawyer is objecting, the press 9 lawyer is objecting.

10 We have a right to remain here. 11 THE COURT OFFICER: Step out. 12 Step out. 13 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: Why? This is an open 14 courtroom. 15 THE COURT OFFICER: Step out. 16 Any questions -- any and all questions will be 17 answered in the hallway.

18 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: The press lawyer has a 19 question. 20 THE COURT OFFICER: This is not an open forum. 21 We will answer all questions in the hallway. 22 Please step out. 23 This is a Supreme Court courtroom. 24 Step out. 25 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: This is an open 4245 1 courtroom.

2 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: It is open to the 3 people, open to the public. You can't throw us out! 4 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: Our lawyer has a 5 question. 6 This is a public forum, why do we need to step 7 out? 8 THE COURT OFFICER: Step out, please. 9 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: Where do you want us to 10 go? 11 We have a lawyer here. 12 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: I am the lawyer. 13 THE COURT OFFICER: Keep going, please. 14 I will answer all questions out in the hallway. 15 I will answer everything in the hallway, but right 16 now everybody step out. 17 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: We are guests, why do we 18 have to leave? 19 THE COURT OFFICER: Step out, everybody. 20 Step out in the hallway. 21 Let's go. 22 A PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE: Will this be on the 23 record so that we can read it afterwards? 24 THE COURT OFFICER: Step out, please. 25 Step out.

4246 1 Step out, please.

2 Step out. 3 (The courtroom is cleared of people in the audience 4 by the court officers at this time.) 5 ****** 6 THE COURT: All right. 7 Let the record reflect that it's now five after 8 four. 9 Let the record also reflect that the court officers 10 had great difficulty clearing the courtroom, because the 11 courtroom is made up, primarily, of the press. 12 And I can appreciate that the press wants to be 13 present for every part of these proceedings. Therefore, 14 this record is not sealed. The press will have access to 15 this record. 16 The fact that I had to clear the courtroom and that 17 the court officers, including the Captain, had great 18 difficulty clearing the courtroom, and that there was 19 argument back and forth between the press and including 20 counsel for the press, goes to why I had to clear the 21 courtroom in the first place: 22 And that is, sir, your conduct is contemptuous 23 right now. 24 I'm putting you on notice that your conduct is 25 contemptuous.

4247 1 If you try to stare me down one more time, I will 3 I will strike his entire testimony; do you 4 understand me?

5 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge. I understand. 6 THE COURT: Listen to the question and answer the 7 question. 8 THE WITNESS: Can I say something, please? 9 THE COURT: No. No. This is not a conversation.

1 Q Did you care about President Trump's interest while you 2 were dealing with Michael Cohen?

16 We've met before; right? 17 A Yes.

15 ******** 16 CROSS-EXAMINATION
17 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
18 Q Good afternoon, Mr. Costello. 19 A Hi.

20 Q On April 17th, 2018, your partner, Joel Citron (Sic), 21 reached out to Michael Cohen by email; is that correct?

22 A Jeff, Jeff Citron. 23 Q I apologize. 24 Jeff Citron?

25 A Yes.

5 A Yeah.

2 media in conversations about this case?

4258 1 Q To see if he would be interested in meeting with you; 2 is that correct? 3 A I'm sorry, say that again? 4 Q To see if Michael Cohen would be interested in meeting 5 with you; is that correct? 6 A No. The email speaks for itself. 7 Q Well, let's take a look at People's Exhibit 512P. 8 Well, before we put it up.

11 A He did. Yes, he did. 12 Q And didn't Mr. Citron in that email lay out all of your 13 qualifications, that you were a former Chief of the Criminal 14 Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office and that you had 15 represented famous people like Leona Helmsley and George 16 Steinberg; didn't he send that type of email to Mr. Cohen? 17 A I don't remember. The email speaks for itself.

18 Q Well, let's take a look at that. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's look at People's 20 Exhibit 512P. 21 Just for the witness, the Court and counsel. 22 (Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.) 23 ********** 24 Q Do you recognize that email, sir? 25 A Yes, I do.

9 Mr. Citron did not email Mr. Cohen to see if he wanted to 10 meet with you?

1 Q Who is that an email from and to, and who is copied on 2 that? 3 A That was from Jeffrey Citron to -- it's blocked out. 4 But this should have been Jeffrey Citron to Michael Cohen.

5 Q And are you copied on that email, sir? 6 A I'm sorry?

7 Q Are you also copied on that email? 8 A (Witness reading.) 9 Q I know there are certain redactions, but does it 11 A What's confusing to see is that this is sayings it's 12 from Michael Cohen to Jeffrey Citron, but I guess this is a 13 string. 14 Q It's a string, so look at the bottom.

15 A So I'm having trouble seeing the string, yes.

23 Q So, now you see an email that Mr. Citron sent and 25 Are you aware of that now? Do you see that email exchange, 4259 16 Q So you were on those emails?

17 A Yes, I was.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer those in evidence. 19 MR. BOVE: No objection.

20 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 21 (So marked in evidence.)
22 ********* 24 copied you on.

10 appear --
4260 1 extolling your experiences, your famous clients, and what you 2 wanted? 3 A Except you misstated it before, you stated I was Chief 4 of the Criminal Division, it's Deputy Chief.

5 Q I apologize for that. Deputy Chief of the Criminal 6 Division.

7 Is that otherwise accurate, the question I asked you? 8 A It is, yeah. 9 Q And you were hoping that Michael Cohen would hire you 10 as his lawyer; correct? 11 A I wasn't hoping anything. It wasn't my email.

12 Q I'm sorry, had you heard about the case in the news, 14 of 2018, as the Personal Attorney to President Trump?

15 Had you heard about it in the news? 16 A I probably did, yeah.

17 Q It was big news; right?

18 A If I heard about it, I guess it was. 19 Q And you and your partner thought this would be a good 20 opportunity to see if you could get Michael Cohen as your 21 client; isn't that correct?

22 A No. This was Jeffrey Citron's relationship with 23 Michael Cohen. 24 He knew him for ten years.

25 I didn't know Michael Cohen from a hole in the wall.

13 sir, that Michael Cohen had had search warrants in early April 4261 1 Q So, you weren't interested in having him as your 2 client? 3 A No, I wasn't. 4 Q And so, you met with him, but you weren't interested in 5 retaining him; is that right?

10 Q So, you were just accompanying him to this meeting? 11 A Well, I wouldn't say I was just accompanying him, it 12 was Jeff Citron's client, not mine. 13 Q But I thought you said they knew each other, he wasn't 14 his client, I thought you said they knew each other? 15 A Yes, Jeff Citron knew Michael Cohen for at least ten 16 years. 17 Q So you knew at the time, based on the news, that 18 Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney; 19 correct? 20 A I think I knew that before we entered the Regency 21 Hotel, yes. 22 Q And if you could land him as a client, Personal 23 Attorney to the President, that would be a big case for your 24 firm; wouldn't it? 25 A I suppose so.

6 A I met with him because Jeff Citron made an arrangement 7 with Michael Cohen. 8 And he asked me to come along, because Jeff Citron is a real 9 estate attorney and this was, obviously, a criminal matter.

4262

1 Q And it would get you public exposure; wouldn't it?
2 A Yes, it would. 3 Q And you would be in the news as his attorney; right? 4 A I guess that's true, yes. 5 Q And this is what you would call a high profile case for 6 you; right? 7 A Probably, yes. 8 Q And it would connect you with the President of the 9 United States, right, because he was his former -- his Personal 10 Attorney; right? 11 A No, it would not. 12 Q It wouldn't connect you with the President of the 13 United States and those who were close him, like Rudy Giuliani? 14 A No. Rudy Giuliani wasn't involved in representing 16 at all. 17 Q But just a few days later he was representing President 18 Trump; right? 19 A Two days later is not the date that we met, yes. 20 Q So, is it your testimony that this wouldn't push you 21 into the arena with Rudy Giuliani and President Trump by 22 representing Michael Cohen? 23 A I don't understand that question. 24 What do you mean it would "push me into the arena?" 25 Q Well, I will withdraw the question.

15 President Trump at that point in time. He wasn't in the picture 4263 1 Having Michael Cohen as a client, you said, would be a big 2 win for you and your firm; correct? 3 A I didn't say that. 4 You did. 5 Q I'm asking you. Would it be a big win for you and your 6 firm? 7 A No. I would say no. I didn't want him as a client 8 with the firm.

11 list, as your client? 12 A I don't know what the firm would do. 13 Q Okay. 16 Just to the witness, please, the Court and the 17 parties.

20 it's from and who it's to. 21 A Yes. I have read it. 22 I know what it is. 23 Q Who is it from and who is it to? 24 A This was from me to my son. 25 Q What is the date of the email, sir?

9 Q Would it be something that you would announce on your 10 website, your firm's website, if you had on him on the client 18 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.) 19 Q And maybe you can review that email and let us know who 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we, please, show now People's 15 528M.

4264 1 A April 20th.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer that in evidence. 3 MR. BOVE: No objection. 4 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

5 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put that up on the screen, 6 please.

8 Q And I would like you to ask you to, please, read it. 9 Please read your email to your son and your son's response, 10 if you would. 11 A You want me to read it?

12 Q Yes, sir. If you are able to. 13 A Okay. From the bottom up. 14 It says, "I will be on the team."
15 That was Michael Cohen's phraseology. 16 Quote. "It would be an honor to have you as part of my 17 team. I will be eternally grateful for the help and guidance 18 you have already given me." 19 That's a quote from Michael Cohen.

20 Q If you would just, just read the email, please, from 21 your son?

22 A That's what it says, it says -- it's in quotes and it 23 says, "Michael Cohen, Personal Attorney to Donald J. Trump." 24 I did read it.

25 Q Okay.

7 (Displayed.)
4265 1 A The second paragraph. "This is not public --" that, 2 too, was from Michael Cohen. 6 Trump and tell him that I will be representing Michael Cohen." 7 That's my Michael Cohen's instructions, right. 8 Q So what you're saying is, you were not saying that you 9 were going to put it on your firm's website, you were not going 10 to announce it; is that right? 11 A This has nothing to do with my firm's website. 12 Q It says, "I don't know when it's going to be announced. 13 Please keep it to yourself?" 14 A Announced by Michael Cohen. 15 Q So what you're saying is that that's all Michael 16 Cohen's language, not you, telling your son that? 17 A Okay, yes.

18 Q Okay. Can you read your son's response? 19 A "Wow. That's big news. Congrats, Dad. I hope this 20 leads to a lot of good things coming your way." 21 That's from my son, yeah. 22 Q And so, you were telling your son that you were going 23 to be involved in this big case and it was going to be great big 24 news for you and your firm; is that right? 25 A No. I was telling my son exactly what I told my son in 3 "-- yet. So do not say anything to anyone about this. I do 4 not know when we will make an announcement, but I have been 5 authorized to contact Rudy Giuliani as counsel to President 4266 1 this email.

2 And this is his response to it. 7 A Yes. On April 17th.

10 Q Sure. 11 After your partner -- as we saw in the email -- reached out 12 to him and asked if he would like to meet with you; isn't that 13 right? 14 A No. That's not what he said. He said to Michael 15 Cohen, I have a partner who used to be the Deputy Chief of the 16 Criminal Division of the US Attorney's Office. If you want to 17 pick his brain, let me know.

18 And Michael Cohen responded immediately, yes, I want to meet 19 him. 20 Q So, Mr. Citron reached out to see if Michael Cohen 21 would want to speak to you and you had a meeting with him; is 22 that right? 23 A Yes. Yes, that's what the email said. 24 Q Okay. So let's talk about the meeting on April 17th?

25 A Sure.
5 Now, Mr. Cohen agreed to meet with you and Mr. Citron; 6 correct? 8 Mr. Cohen requested to meet with us. He asked us to come to 9 the Regency Hotel. 3 Q Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about meeting at 4 the Regency on April 16th, 2016.

4267 1 Q Now, you said that you met with him at the Regency 2 Hotel, where he was staying with his family; correct? 7 A Yeah, I would say, sure.

12 Q And you know from your experience, that executing 13 search warrants is that they come into your place, wherever it 14 is, and they take your personal items, phones, your devices 15 documents, et cetera. 16 You know what a search warrants is; do you not? 17 A Of course I do.

18 Q And, you knew, as a result of that, and you knew, 19 obviously, he was under criminal investigation by the Southern 20 District of New York; right? 21 A I did, yes. 22 Q And that's pretty serious; isn't it?

3 A We met with him at the Regency Hotel. I didn't know 4 where he was staying when I met with him. 5 Q And you knew, based on the news of the search warrants, 6 that Mr. Cohen had been through a traumatic event; right? 8 Q And, because eight days earlier, the FBI had raided his 9 apartment, his hotel room, and his office; right?

10 A I wouldn't use the term "raided." They executed a 11 search warrant.

25 lawyer's offices and hotel rooms, et cetera, that's pretty 24 Q And, in fact, having a search warrant executed at 23 A Generally, yes.

4268 1 serious; isn't it?

2 A It's very serious, and it requires special proof. 3 Q And, in fact, you said that -- well, withdrawn. 4 Mr. Cohen was visibly shaken up that day; wasn't he? 5 A He was suicidal that day and acting manic -- he was 6 manic. 7 Q And you said he was pacing back and forth; right? 8 A That's correct.

11 A Oh, (laughter), 40 years -- 50 years. 12 Q Now, and in all that time as a criminal defense 13 attorney, you can understand how traumatic it is for somebody to 14 go through that kind of experience? 15 A Talk into the microphone, please. 16 Q Oh, I'm sorry. 17 As a criminal defense attorney for all of those years, you 18 can understand how traumatic it is for someone to go through 19 that kind of experience; right? 20 A Yes, sure. 21 Q And as a criminal defense attorney, you can empathize 22 with someone who has gone through that experience; can you not, 23 sir? 24 A Yes. 25 Q But you thought he was being a drama queen; didn't 9 Q And you had been a criminal defense attorney for how 10 long, sir, at that time?

4269 1 you?

2 A No, I didn't know Michael Cohen. I had never met him 3 before in my life. 4 And he was putting on quite a show, and I didn't know when 5 he initially said -- 6 Q Sir. 7 A I was -- 8 Q Sir. 9 A I'm answering your question.

10 MR. BOVE: The witness needs to be allowed to 11 finish his answer. 12 THE COURT: Surely. 13 He can finish his answer. 14 A (Continuing.) He was putting on quite a show. 15 And he explained to us -- he told us that two nights before 16 he was on the roof of the Regency Hotel and he was going to jump 17 off and kill himself because he couldn't handle the pressure of 18 what he saw as the ongoing criminal case coming his way. 19 Q Sure. 20 And you remember testifying in the Grand Jury in this case, 21 sir? 22 A Yes, I do. 23 Q And you remember that it was in March, on March 20th of 24 2023?

25 A Approximately, yeah.
4270 1 Q And did you tell the Grand Jury that you didn't know 2 whether he was being a drama queen or not? 3 A Yeah, and that's because -- 4 Q Did you tell -- 5 A And that's because -- 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Well, I'm asking for the witness 7 to answer the question, your Honor.

13 Q Sure. 14 Did you tell the Grand Jury that he was acting like a drama 15 queen? 16 A No. I said I didn't know whether he was acting as a 17 drama queen, right --
18 Q Well, you don't like drama queens; right? 19 A I just didn't know, because I didn't know the guy. 20 I couldn't assess whether these actions by him were genuine 21 or not, but my partner thought they were, and he knew him for 22 ten years. 23 Q So, Michael Cohen ultimately chose a different lawyer 24 to represent him; right? 25 Not you; is that correct?

8 THE COURT: Sir, if you are able to answer the 9 question yes or no, please answer yes or no.

10 If you are not able to, just let Ms. Hoffinger know 11 and she will rephrase it. 12 A Do you want me to answer that question yes or no?

4271 1 A Well, he had one lawyer at the time that was talking to 2 him, that was McDermott Will & Emery. 3 He was also talking to Guy Petrillo, who he, later on in 4 June, whatever the date was, he announced publicly that he was 5 going to retain Guy Petrillo. 8 A Retained? 9 You mean he signed a Retainer Agreement?

10 I don't know. 11 Q Whether he signed a Retainer Agreement or not, he ended 12 up going with Guy Petrillo to represent him in connection with 13 the matter in the Southern District, not you; correct? 14 A Yes, that's correct. 15 THE COURT: Counsel, please approach. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Sure. 17 *******
18 (AT SIDEBAR.) 19 THE COURT: So, I haven't asked the jurors if they 20 can work late. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes. 22 THE COURT: How much more do you have? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: I probably have about maybe half an 24 hour, at the most. 25 But --
6 Q So he retained Guy Petrillo instead of you; is that 7 correct?

4272 5 time. 6 Before I excuse you, I remind you to please not 7 talk, either among yourselves or with anyone else, about 8 anything related to the case. 9 Please continue to keep an open mind.

10 Do not form or express an opinion about the 11 defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is 12 in, and I have given you my final instructions on the law, 13 and I have directed you to begin your deliberations. 14 Do not request, accept, agree to accept, or discuss 15 with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or 16 benefit in return for supplying any information concerning 17 the trial.

18 Report directly to me any incident within your 19 knowledge involving an attempt by any person improperly to 20 influence you or any member of the jury. 21 Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed 22 in the testimony. 23 And do not use any program or electronic device 24 to search for and view any location discussed in the 25 testimony.

1 THE COURT: Let's come back tomorrow.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. Thank you. 3 (End sidebar.) 4 THE COURT: Jurors, we are going to stop at this 4273 1 Do not read, view or listen to any accounts or 2 discussions of the case, and that includes the reading or 3 the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the 4 trial, or the reading of any posts on any Court sites. 5 Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law 6 related to the case. 7 Do not communicate with anyone about the case by 8 any means, including by telephone, text messages, email, or 9 the internet.

10 And do not Google or otherwise search for any 11 information about the case or the law which applies to the 12 case or the people involved in the case. 13 I will see you tomorrow morning at 9:30. 14 Have a good night. 15 THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. 16 (Jury exits.) 17 **********
18 THE COURT: Remain seated. 19 Sir, you may step down. 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, your Honor, before 21 Mr. Costello goes, would you please ask him or tell him that 22 he's not to be in contact with the Defense team directly or 23 through other parties while he's still on the stand. 24 MR. BOVE: As counsel, we are going to and do abide 25 by that either way.

4274 1 THE COURT: I generally do not give that 2 instruction, but you can ask him tomorrow whether he has or 3 has not. 4 (Witness excused.)
5 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger, you think that you have 6 about a half hour left?

7 I'm not going to rush you. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Understood, understood. Probably 9 half an hour to 45 minutes at the most.

10 And I may cut some of it tonight, so. 11 THE COURT: Okay. And then I expected you will 12 have some redirect?

20 this point. 21 THE COURT: That can change, but it appears that 22 tomorrow very early in the morning you will rest and I will 23 excuse the jury at that time. 24 All right. Thank you, everyone.

25 MR. BOVE: Judge --
13 MR. BOVE: Yes, your Honor. 14 But I don't expect that it's going to be long.

15 THE COURT: Okay. And then at this point, do you 16 expect to call any other witnesses?

17 MR. BOVE: Not at this point, Judge.

18 We are going to do some thinking tonight, but, 19 obviously, there are some limitations on that, but not at 4275 1 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we don't have to do this 2 now, but at the conclusion of the People's case, at sidebar 3 we said that we were going to move for a Trial Order of 4 Dismissal. 5 I do not have to do that now -- 6 THE COURT: We can do it now. That's fine. 7 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor. 8 Your Honor, for several reasons we believe that the 9 Court should enter a Trial Order of Dismissal now.

10 First, there is absolutely no evidence that the 11 filings were false. 12 The business records were not false. 13 There is no dispute that Mr. Cohen provided legal 14 services to President Trump in 2017. 15 Not only did Mr. Cohen admit that, but Miss 16 Tarasoff when she booked the records that are part of at 17 least 12 of the counts said the same thing.

18 When they were entered in the Trump system, they 19 were entered as legal expenses for Retainer Agreement. 20 There is no dispute that during 2017, that's 21 exactly what Mr. Cohen was doing for President Trump. 22 Now, not only that, but when the invoices were sent 23 to The Trump Organization, there is no evidence that those 24 were mishandled and entered falsely. 25 So when the invoices are sent, President Trump is 4276 1 not in New York, he's in the White House, and the invoices 2 come in for services rendered. 3 And Mr. Cohen testified that he was rendering 4 services for President Trump during that time, as his 5 Personal Attorney.

10 intent to defraud by President Trump in connection with 11 these filings. 12 So, even, even if there was evidence that the 13 records themselves were false -- but they weren't -- these 14 are records that were generated in connection with Michael 22 So, again, the idea that there would be any sort of 23 intent to defraud by President Trump when the invoices are 24 going to The Trump Organization, a check is being generated 25 for him to sign in the White House, for the President to 8 They are accurate business filings. 9 Second, there is no evidence that there is any 6 So, at the start, there is absolutely no false 7 business filing.

17 He was paid first by a trust, by The Trust, for 18 three of the months and then out of the personal funds -- 19 the personal bank account of President Trump, while 20 President Trump was the only person that had any signatory 21 authority over the bank account.

15 Cohen's personal relationship and Personal Attorney-client 16 relationship with President Trump in 2017.

4277 7 personal -- his personal records of the Trump Organization. 8 So, again, if there was an intent to defraud, there would be 9 evidence of something besides what we have here.

10 Either the records are entered in a different 11 manner, either they are entered in a false manner describing 12 something, services that are different than what was 13 actually rendered or something to give even a little bit of 14 evidence that there is an intent to defraud. 15 We have none of that. 16 And, third, your Honor, the other crimes that 17 purportedly are being covered up in connection with these 18 false business filings -- there are no other crimes. 19 And, now, the People rested earlier today. 20 And there is no evidence, zero evidence, that 21 anyone was thinking about a Campaign Finance charge in 2016 22 when this payment was made to Ms. Daniels. 23 There is also no evidence that anybody was thinking 25 Mr. Cohen met in January of 20 -- of 2017 to come up with a 1 sign in the White House, and then -- which he does, which he 2 signs in the White House. 3 There is no evidence that there is any idea or any 4 intent by President Trump at that time to mislead or to hide 5 or to falsify the business records. 6 And, again, now, these are records of his 24 about a Campaign Finance charge when Mr. Weisselberg and 4278 1 way that he would be paid.

2 There is a $35,000 monthly retainer. It was 3 established months after the election. 4 And so, there is simply no evidence that there is 5 any effort to conceal anything by -- not only by President 6 Trump, but also by any of the others involved. 7 And so, the Prosecutors have talked in their 8 opening statement and in papers about some sort of 9 conspiracy to influence the election.

10 But, as the Court knows, there has to be something 11 illegal about this effort. 12 There has to be something illegal about the efforts 13 by the coconspirators to influence the election. 14 And what the evidence shows is that they all got 15 together in 2015 and agreed that they would talk about 16 positive and negative stories, and that there would be 17 positive stories pushed and negative stories pushed and that 18 Mr. Pecker would keep an eye out, keep an eye out for 19 anything that he heard that was bad about President 20 Trump. 21 Now, there is no evidence from any of the witnesses 22 who testified of any criminal intent with respect to any of 23 those, of that kind. 24 The underlying criminal intent that the People are 25 suggesting, FECA, New York State Tax Fraud, some other 4279 1 business record fraud that they claim showed some sort of 2 criminal intent. 3 As a matter of law, they should not be allowed to 4 use any of those predicates, when at the end of the day 5 there is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Pecker, Mr. Cohen, 6 President Trump, Dylan Howard, or any of the other purported 7 coconspirators for this Misdemeanor State Law crime had any 8 criminal intent at the time that they were engaging in this 9 conduct.

10 (Whereupon, at this time, Senior Court Reporter 11 Laurie Eisenberg relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 12 as the official court reporter.) 13 ******** 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 4280 1 Proceedings 26 25 influence an election, how on Earth is keeping a false 27 Laurie Eisenberg, CSR, RPR
28 Senior Court Reporter 2 1 MR. BLANCHE: By the way, there was no discussion 3 2 at this October 2015 meeting about catch and kill. Nobody 4 3 said that.

5 4 There was no discussion about any financial 6 5 payments that would potentially be made with respect to 7 6 any stories.

8 7 So, you don't have evidence of any criminal 9 8 intent or criminal conduct at this supposed first meeting 10 9 where the conspiracy is born and then played out over the 11 10 next year plus.

12 11 Then, when you look at actually how the 13 12 conspiracy played out, Karen McDougal, if the evidence is 14 13 to be credited, she never even wanted her story out. She 15 14 was looking to start her career anew, jumpstart her 16 15 career. She wanted an arrangement with AMI so that she 17 16 could be on the covers of magazines, write a column; not 18 17 catch and kill a story.

19 18 While that's the words used by Mr. Cohen and in 20 19 opening statements, that's not the evidence that came out 21 20 at trial.

22 21 That was a demonstrably false story. Everybody 23 22 agrees.

24 23 So, again, if there's some conspiracy to 25 24 influence an election or some conspiracy to illegally 4281 1 story from the voters criminal?

8 As it relates to Ms. Daniels, AMI wanted nothing 9 to do with that. There's lots of testimony about that.

10 When it came to catching and killing, which is 11 supposedly the conspiracy that's going to be entered into 12 between Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, 13 if that was really the conspiracy, AMI jumped out of that 14 conspiracy.

15 As you heard over the past several weeks, 16 Mr. Pecker was insistent that he wanted nothing to do with 17 any kind of catch and kill with Ms. Daniels. 18 In fact, that led to Mr. Cohen entering into an 19 NDA with her.

20 Mr. Cohen is not a member of the press. He 21 doesn't own the National Enquirer.

22 This isn't a catch and kill story, which is, 23 supposedly, the conspiracy that was formed in 24 October 2016.

25 So, the three separate incidents this jury heard 2 So, it's a false story, and there's a decision 3 made to pay off the person who's spreading the false 4 story. That means that a false story is not being 5 presented to the folks that are voting in New York State. 6 That's not a catch and kill, your Honor, 7 certainly not a criminal catch and kill.

4282 21 proof.

24 that took place, a key part is keeping President Trump 25 updated, and he said it 19 times on his direct, and today 1 about that gave conspiratorial criminal intent to the 2 participants are not that at all. 3 So, the underlying predicate that gives rise -- 4 that makes this misdemeanor a felony, there's simply no 5 evidence of any intent, of any criminal intent on any of 6 the parties in 2016, 2017; and for that reason, the Court 7 should enter a verdict in favor of the Defendant. 8 Finally: 9 We've been saying this for months, and we heard 10 Mr. Cohen testify the past several days. 11 There is no way that the Court should let this 12 case go to the jury, relying on Mr. Cohen's testimony. 13 And I don't think the People will disagree that 14 without Mr. Cohen, there is no case. Meaning, without his 15 testimony last week and today, there is no case. 16 And he not only lied repeatedly in the past under 17 oath, but he lied in this courtroom. 18 And I'm sure that the People will say: Well, he 19 didn't really lie, or he misremembered.

20 But, we put on irrefutable proof, irrefutable 22 When he testified on direct about a phone call 23 and he remembers specifically a key part of this crime 4283 1 he said he talked to him about it more than 20 times --
2 that's, obviously, a key part of their story. 3 He confidently said that on October 24th, when he 4 had that call just after eight o'clock at night, the 5 purpose of the call was to call Keith Schiller, have 6 Mr. Schiller give the phone to President Trump and then --
9 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. Absolutely.

10 Because it wasn't just that lie, your Honor. 11 He also lied to this Court repeatedly, for 12 example, about his testimony in front of Congress and 13 whether he said that he never asked for a pardon. 14 It shouldn't move the Court that he continues to 15 lie about that? 16 I mean, the Court has the transcript. The Court 17 has the evidence, the testimony that he put in in front of 18 Congress where he says something that we know from the 19 testimony at this trial was not true.

20 And he still doubles down. 21 THE COURT: So you want me to take it out of the 22 jury's hands and decide before it even gets to the jury 23 that, as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of 24 belief that it shouldn't be considered by the jury?

25 That's what you're asking?

7 THE COURT: So you're asking me to find Mr. Cohen 8 not credible as a matter of law?

4284 6 Again, as your Honor ruled before this trial 12 He testified. And he lied under oath. In this 13 courtroom. 23 convince 12 jurors. 24 THE COURT: I would like to hear from the People.

25 MR. COLANGELO: The standard, as the Court knows, 7 started with respect to that issue, your Honor said, 8 correctly, that he hadn't appeared in front of you, so it 9 wouldn't be appropriate just based on past allegations of 10 lying under oath, it wouldn't be appropriate to just say 11 he can't testify.

14 And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by 15 the jury, is that -- is a conviction, potentially. 16 And so, imagine the --
17 THE COURT: You said his lies are "irrefutable;" 18 that you think he's going to fool 12 New Yorkers into 19 believing this lie?

20 MR. BLANCHE: Well, Judge -- 21 THE COURT: It's an "irrefutable" lie?

22 MR. BLANCHE: I certainly hope he doesn't 1 MR. BLANCHE: That his entire testimony should 2 not be considered by the jury. Absolutely. That's exactly 3 what we're asking the Court to do. 4 Again, we didn't just catch him in a lie, your 5 Honor. He came in here with a history of lying under oath.

4285 1 for the motion the Defense just made requires assessing 2 the evidence in the light most favorable to the 3 Prosecution, assuming that the jury credits the People's 6 So, against that backdrop, there's just no 12 because Mr. Cohen performed or provided legal services in 13 2017. 18 Then, of course, you have People's Exhibits 35 19 and 36, accompanied by the testimony of Jeff McConney 20 explaining those documents, which memorialize and track 24 On top of that, you have the admission in at 25 least three other pieces of evidence we introduced.

10 key arguments: 11 First is that there's no evidence of falsity 14 The trial record overwhelmingly rebuts the 15 argument "there's no evidence of falsity." 16 Among other things, Mr. Cohen performed similar 17 legal services in 2018 and was not paid.

21 the conversion of the $130,000 wire transfer to Keith 22 Davidson into the exact $420,000 reimbursement that 23 Mr. Cohen ultimately received.

4 witnesses and giving the Prosecution's evidence the full 5 weight it might reasonably be accorded.

7 argument that the evidence falls short of the standard the 8 People need to show to defeat this motion. 9 Let me address -- I think Mr. Blanche made three 4286 4 Defendant reimbursed Mr. Cohen for expenses he incurred.

5 We've got People's 407G, I believe it was, which 6 was a public statement from the Defendant admitting he 7 reimbursed Mr. Cohen. 8 You have the testimony from Ms. Daniels' 9 transcript, 2903, where she acknowledged from civil 23 accounting staff and the normal operations of the 24 accounting staff.

25 As a matter of law, your Honor, it's sufficient, 10 litigation in California, the Defendant acknowledged 11 Mr. Cohen had to be reimbursed.

12 The evidence this payment was for reimbursement 13 and not for a retainer for legal services performed is 14 overwhelming; and, at minimum, a rational juror can 15 conclude beyond a reasonable doubt the invoices, the 16 ledger entries, the signed checks with check stubs, all 17 contain false instruments. 18 Mr. Blanche made a couple of arguments regarding 19 intent to defraud. At least one of them touched on the 20 first element in the CJI instruction, whether the 21 Defendant made or caused a false entry in the business of 22 his entries, because Mr. Blanche talked about the 1 People's 81, which is the Defendant's signed and 2 certified Office of Government Ethics Form, which explains 3 in that footnote we pointed to on Page 45 that the 4287 1 more than sufficient, if the Defendant set in motion the 2 sequence of events that led to the false entries being 3 made and if those false entries were the reasonable, 4 foreseeable consequences of his actions.

5 So, I think there can be no question related to 6 the overwhelming evidence leading up to the payment scheme 7 that the Defendant caused the false entries. 8 On intent to defraud, again, your Honor, you 9 already held in denying the Defendant's Omnibus Motion 13 The first was evidence of a general intent to 14 deceive.

15 And, here, the evidence in the trial record, 16 including the overwhelming record of concealment, is --
17 supports general intent to deceive. 18 The Court also acknowledged general intent to 19 deceive the voting public supports -- also supports the 20 element of intent to defraud. 21 Then, of course, as your Honor also held at 22 Page 19 of your Omnibus Decision, the evidence supports a 23 showing of intent to deceive Government regulators. 24 On the last element that Mr. Blanche discussed, 25 the intent to commit, aid or conceal the commission of 10 that, as a matter of law, the Grand Jury supported, at 11 that point at least, three different theories of intent to 12 defraud.

4288 9 excessive individual campaign contribution to Stormy 10 Daniels. 11 And then, of course, your Honor, there's 22 gave.

25 dismissal is not warranted.

1 another crime, your Honor, there were weeks and weeks of 2 testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony 3 was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous 4 phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a 5 conspiracy that was entered into in Trump Tower in August 6 of 2015, that was then effectuated through unlawful means.

7 The "unlawful means" include an illegal corporate 8 contribution to Karen McDougal, the illegal -- the 12 extensive evidence of other false business records being 13 created in the course of carrying out that conspiracy, 14 including the false invoice from Investor Advisory 15 Services to conceal the intended transaction between AMI 16 and Mr. Trump, as well as all of the false documents that 17 Mr. Cohen submitted to his bank in order to open both of 18 the shell companies he intended to use to tender the 19 transfer.

20 There's a lot more. We don't need to give a full 21 summation in order to rebut the information Mr. Blanche 23 The trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each 24 of the element of the offense, and the trial Order of 4289 1 THE COURT: I'll reserve decision.

2 MR. BLANCHE: Briefly, your Honor, the evidence 3 of there being any sort of illegality in this 7 False filings of AMI records doesn't qualify. 8 False records years after the fact, the fact that 9 there was a campaign contribution that Mr. Cohen 10 ultimately pled guilty to, that shouldn't qualify. 11 The evidence that came in this courtroom is 12 really what the Court should consider. 13 You have no evidence of a catch and kill at that 14 meeting; just evidence that -- of what reporters and 15 politicians do every day during every campaign, and the 16 People have turned that into a beginning of a 17 conspiratorial agreement and relationship. 18 But, that's not what the evidence showed over the 19 last several years.

20 At the end of the day -- then I'll sit down -- 21 you have a books and records violation where you have a 22 legal expense. That's the entry that's false, supposedly. 23 And you have testimony, non-contrary, that 24 Mr. Cohen was President Trump's lawyer in 2017.

25 So, it's hard to imagine what book -- how this 4 conspiracy -- a conspiracy isn't a conspiracy just because 5 three people get together and talk. There has to be an 6 illegal objective.

4290 1 was supposed to be booked by the Trump -- by Ms. Tarasoff 2 when she gets the invoice. How is she supposed to book the 3 fact that the lawyer working for President Trump was his 4 personal attorney? Legal expense.

5 So -- I was going to just finish with Mr. Cohen. 6 I won't go on and on.

7 The other -- in addition to what I already said, 8 Judge, the exacting testimony that he gave this jury -- 9 and we crossed him on it, but a lot of the objections were 10 sustained. The exacting testimony that he gave about 11 particular conversations that he remembered with President 12 Trump in 2016, we never saw those. They're not in any 13 notes with the Special Counsel, with the Southern 14 District, or with the Manhattan District Attorney. That's 15 something that we talked about before. 16 He definitely talked about in the Grand Jury and 17 in meetings that there were phone calls and there were 18 conversations. 19 That's a lot different than what he said on the 20 stand when he gave very specific recollection. 21 That's something -- that's not something we knew 22 about. Apparently, the People knew he was going to do 23 that. 24 Under the law, if he's going to change his story 25 like that, they should provide us notes of that. They 4291 1 didn't.

2 That's another reason why his testimony should be 3 rejected, your Honor. 4 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, as the Court knows 5 and as Defense Counsel knows, they have received probably 6 hundreds of pages of notes of conversations with 7 Mr. Cohen. It is simply not the case that his testimony at 8 the trial was not reflected in the notes. 9 The Defense Counsel had ample opportunity to 10 impeach by omission. Where impeaching by omission was 11 permitted, the Court permitted it. Where it was not 12 appropriate, the Court did not allow it. 13 There's no evidence, none, that his testimony in 14 this courtroom was new.

15 One other correction. 16 The false entries on the invoices, General Ledger 17 entries, and checks or check stubs were these payments 18 that were falsely described as payments pursuant to a 19 retainer for services rendered in a given month, not the 20 legal expense standard. 21 THE COURT: Thank you both.

22 As I said, I'm going to reserve decision. 23 See you tomorrow at 9:30. 24 MR. BLANCHE: Can we approach?

25 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 4292 1 at sidebar:) 2 MR. BLANCHE: I just have a scheduling question.

3 Assuming we'll finish by 10-ish, 10:15-ish, are 4 we going to go right to the charge conference, or in the 5 afternoon?

6 THE COURT: What's your preference? 7 MR. BLANCHE: Emil is arguing it.

8 MR. STEINGLASS: He's behind you. 9 (Whereupon, Defense Counsel confer.)
10 MR. BOVE: Whenever it's convenient.

11 THE COURT: I think that we should take at least 12 a short break so that we can all properly prepare for the 13 pre-charge conference. 14 Unless there's a strong objection, I would 15 actually like to come back at 2:15 and do it in the 16 afternoon. 17 MR. COLANGELO: No objection here.

18 We were just conferring on the exchange of 19 proposed language your Honor was requesting this morning. 20 We haven't had an opportunity yet to exchange 21 that proposed language. The additional time will give us 22 a chance to do that.

23 THE COURT: Okay. 24 (Whereupon, the case is adjourned to May 21, 25 2024.)
