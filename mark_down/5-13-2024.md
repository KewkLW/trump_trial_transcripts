 Senior Court Reporter 3255 3256 1 THE CLERK: Calling People of the State of New 2 York versus Donald J. Trump. Indictment 71543/23. 3 Appearances, starting with the People. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 5 Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Becky 6 Mangold, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis.

7 Good morning. 8 MR. BLANCHE: Good morning. 9 Todd Blanche. I'm joined by Emil Bove, Susan 10 Necheles, Kendra Wharton, and President Donald Trump 11 sitting to my right.

12 THE COURT: Good morning, everyone. 13 Good morning, Mr. Trump. 14 Before we get started with the first witness, is 15 there anything you would like to bring to my attention? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: No, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: I did receive the People's list of 18 proposed jury charges. I glanced at them. I didn't have an 19 opportunity to really digest them.

20 I did want to address the Separation Agreement in 21 general, the Release issue that came up late on Friday.

22 I had the opportunity to review it. 23 It would come in as a business record, but I'm 24 not going to allow it in.

25 It seems to me that this would be used to justify 1 an explanation for why somebody is not here.

2 It doesn't prove any element of the offense. It 3 doesn't move the ball in any way in satisfying your burden 4 of proof.

5 So, I'm going to deny your application. 6 Can I hold onto this one?

7 (Mr. Steinglass nods yes.) 8 THE COURT: If there's nothing else? 9 Let's get the jury, please.

10 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 11 Jury entering.

12 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 13 are present and properly seated.) 14 THE CLERK: Do both parties stipulate that all 15 jurors are present and properly seated? 16 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

17 MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

18 THE COURT: Good morning, jurors. 19 Welcome back.

20 People, your next witness, please.

21 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

22 The People call Michael Cohen. 23 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering. 24 (Whereupon, the witness takes the witness stand.)
25 M I C H A E L D E A N C O H E N, having first been duly 3257 3258 1 sworn and/or affirmed by the court clerk, was examined and 2 testified as follows:
4 your last name. 3 COURT OFFICER: State your full name, spelling 5 THE WITNESS: Michael Dean Cohen. C-O-H-E-N. 6 COURT OFFICER: Your county of residence.

7 THE WITNESS: New York, New York.

8 THE COURT: Good morning, Mr. Cohen. 9 THE WITNESS: Good morning.

10 THE COURT: You may inquire. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, Judge.

12 DIRECT EXAMINATION
13 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 14 Q Good morning. 15 A Good morning. 16 Q If I might ask, how old are you, Mr. Cohen?

17 A Fifty-seven.

18 Q Are you married? 19 A I am. 20 Q How long have you been married? 21 A Going on 30 years.

22 Q Do you have any children?

23 A I do. 24 Q How old are your children? 25 A My daughter is 28. My son is 25. Well, 24. He'll be 3259 1 25.

2 Q Are you testifying here today pursuant to a subpoena? 3 A I am. 4 Q Do you have an attorney here in court with you today?

5 A I do.

10 My father is a Holocaust survivor, who ended up emigrating 11 to Toronto, Canada, where he went to medical school; came to 12 the United States in the mid-Sixties to teach head and neck 13 reconstructive surgery; met my mom, who is a surgical nurse. 14 Four children later, here I am.

15 Q Where did you go to college? 16 A I went to the American University in Washington, D.C.

17 Q What did you study in college?

18 A Law and Government. 19 Q After college, what did you do?

20 A I went straight to law school. 21 Q Tell the jury a little bit about why you wanted to be 22 a lawyer. 23 A Actually, I didn't want to be a lawyer. 24 My grandmother wanted me to be a lawyer.

25 My family is comprised of doctors and lawyers. My three 8 A I grew up in Lawrence, Long Island. It's part of the 9 Five Towns in Nassau County.

6 Q Mr. Cohen, if you could tell the jury a little about 7 where you grew up and your childhood education.

3260 1 siblings are lawyers. My -- obviously, my father, my uncles are 2 either doctors or lawyers. The lawyers are married to doctors. 3 I wanted to go to Wall Street. 4 My grandmother was like, "That's not going to happen."
5 Q So, you went to law school? 6 A (Nods yes.)
7 Q Did you graduate from law school? 8 A Yes. 9 Q What year?

10 A 1991. 11 Q Were you admitted to practice law?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Do you remember what year that was?

18 Q Has New York City been your home since that time? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Where did you start your legal career? 21 A I started over at 225 Broadway with a firm called 22 Estrin and Associates. It was a personal injury, medical 23 malpractice, tort litigation firm. 24 Q In addition to practicing law, at some point in the 25 1990s, did you also buy part of a business in taxi medallions?

14 A 1992.

15 Q After law school, where did you move? 16 A I was living at my parents' home and, ultimately, 17 moved to Manhattan.

3261 1 A I did.

2 Q Explain why you did that. 3 A So, one of my clients was leaving the country to move 4 to Israel, and it gave me the opportunity to buy 50 percent 5 interest in a company called Manhattan Maintenance. That was 6 1995. And so I did.

9 Q Did you also invest in some real estate along the 10 years? 11 A I did.

12 Q Tell us a little bit about that. 13 A I started purchasing new developments, specifically in 14 Trump properties. My very first one, in the year 2000, was at 15 Trump World Tower. I also bought on 60th Street, 431 -- I'm 16 sorry. It was called Bridge Tower on 60th Street.

17 Ultimately, down the road, I ended up going into business 18 with a friend of mine who had grown up with me, and we started 19 purchasing buildings.

20 Q Did there come a time when you became a partner in a 21 law firm called Phillips, Nizer?

22 A Yes. 23 Q What kind of work did you do there? 24 A I was, basically, doing business and corporate law.

25 Q Did there come a time when you left Phillips, Nizer?

7 I thought it was, and it turned out to be at that time, a 8 very good investment.

3262 1 A Yes.

2 Q Approximately, what year was that? 3 A 2007. 4 Q Why did you leave Phillips, Nizer?

5 A I left because I was offered an opportunity by 6 Mr. Trump to come work at The Trump Organization as his Special 7 Counsel. 8 Q Do you see Mr. Trump in court today? 9 A I do.

10 Q Could you just indicate an article of clothing that 11 he's wearing, please?

12 A (Lifts up from his seat.) He's wearing a blue and 13 white tie. (Takes his seat.) 14 THE COURT: Indicating Mr. Trump.

16 Q Tell us how you came to work for Mr. Trump at The 17 Trump Organization.

18 A Initially, I was introduced to Mr. Trump by Don, 19 Junior, as I was moving into one of his properties.

20 I had purchased several units, and Don, Junior and The 21 Trump Organization was doing the construction to put the units 22 together. 23 There was an issue over at Trump World Tower that Mr. Trump 24 had asked me -- because not only did I own an apartment there, 25 but my parents did, my in-laws, my friends. We all bought as a 15 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

3263 1 block, going back, again, to the year 2000.

2 And, there was an issue with the Board. 3 What we did is we ended up overtaking the Board and 4 resolving the issue, which was to Mr. Trump's satisfaction. He 5 liked the way that that occurred, and then continued to ask me 6 if I would assist in other issues, legal issues or other 7 matters that he had. 8 Q And did you perform some additional legal work for him 10 A I did. 11 Q What --
12 A Some legal. Some non-legal matters. 13 Q Did he pay you for that work? 14 A No, ma'am. 17 A Yes.

18 Q Did there come a time when you presented him with a 19 bill in connection with some work you had done in connection 20 with one of his properties? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Tell us a little bit about that. 23 A I was asked to review a series of documents that dealt 24 with Trump Entertainment Resorts. There was an issue --
25 Q Who was it who asked you to do that, first?

15 Q Did there come a time where you -- this was when you 16 were still at Phillips, Nizer?

9 at that time?

3264 1 A Mr. Trump had asked me.

2 Q Thank you. 3 A Again, with Trump Entertainment Resorts. 4 I reviewed it. It was quite lengthy. There was some issues 5 going on there in regard to a Chapter 11 reorganization plan. 6 We, ultimately, ended up resolving it.

7 And the bill was, approximately, about -- approximately, 8 about a hundred thousand dollars. 9 I was then asked to meet Mr. Trump at the office, which I
10 did. 11 And I asked about the bill.

12 He asked me whether or not I was happy at my "sleepy old 13 firm". 14 I stated I was.

15 Um, he said, Would you -- "Do you want to come work for 16 me?"
17 And I was honored. I was taken by surprise. And I agreed.

18 Q What happened -- to go back for a moment to the bill 19 for a hundred thousand dollars that you presented from Phillip 20 Nizer, your firm -- 21 A Correct.

22 Q -- what happened with that bill? 23 A He asked me if I wanted to get fired on the first day. 24 If I asked about the bill.

25 Q So, did the bill get paid?

3265 1 A No.

2 Q And, you say he offered you a position at that point? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Tell us a little bit about your discussion about the 5 position that he was offering and the details of it. 6 A So, he offered me the position of Executive Vice 7 President at The Trump Organization and Special Counsel to 8 Donald J. Trump, whereby I would only answer to him, and I 9 would work on issues that were of concern to him.

10 Q Did you discuss at that point what your salary would 11 be?

12 A We did. 13 Q Tell us a little bit about that. 14 A It was a little bit of a back and forth negotiation.

15 He offered me an amount. I said, "It's probably not gonna 16 work." I gave him a counter. And we ended up resolving on 17 somewhere in the middle number.

18 Q Where did you end up -- what's the number that you 19 sort of ended up at?

20 A 375. 21 Q Was that your base salary, bonuses?

22 A That's base salary. 23 Bonus, of course, was to be discussed. 24 Q So, did you decide at that point to leave your law 25 firm, Phillip, Nizer, and to work for Donald Trump at The Trump 3266 1 Organization?

2 A I never went back, not even that day. 3 He sent over some employees to my office to pack up my 4 office and gave me Ivanka Trump's old office on 26, the 26th 5 floor. 6 Q Is that near his office on the 26th floor?

7 A Yes. 9 A Yes.

11 A Yes, ma'am.

12 Q Approximately, how many years did you end up working 13 at The Trump Organization as Mr. Trump's Special Counsel -- is 14 that what you said?

15 A Yes, ma'am. 16 Q How long?

17 A Ten years.

18 Q 2007 to approximately when? 19 A January of 2017.

20 Q How old were you when you first started working at 21 The Trump Organization for Mr. Trump?

22 A Huh. Huh. 23 Q If you recall. 24 A I don't.

25 Q Were you still in your thirties?

8 Q Are we talking about Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue?

10 Q Where The Trump Organization offices were?

3267 1 A Yes.

2 Q And was -- I think you mentioned before; but, when you 3 started, what was your title? 4 A Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald 5 J. Trump.

18 A It was whatever concerned him, whatever he wanted. 19 Um, initially, when I first started working at The Trump 9 A 525,000.

10 Q And did that change over the years or did it, largely, 11 stay the same?

12 A Well, it changed. Initially, after the second year, he 13 cut my salary. Ultimately gave it back, two years after that. 14 But it stayed the same.

15 Q Tell the jury a little bit about what kind of matters 16 you handled for Donald Trump at The Trump Organization during 17 that ten years.

20 Organization, I was presented with an opportunity, and I 21 brought it to Mr. Trump immediately. We liked it. It was in New 22 Jersey. It was called the EnCap Golf Redevelopment Project. It 23 was a 1,000-acre landfill remediation project. 24 And this was all very exciting to me because it was all 25 new, and I enjoyed the challenge.

6 Q And just in terms of your salary and your bonus, 7 approximately all in, how much were you making at The Trump 8 Organization?

3268 1 And, along with two other colleagues, we started to get 2 this project up and running. 3 It, ultimately, didn't come to fruition because the funding 4 got pulled by Governor Corzine in New Jersey at the time.

5 But, it was an exciting project. 6 Q So, this is one of the projects that you handled for 7 him? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Who did you report to at The Trump Organization?

10 A Mr. Trump. 11 Q Were you at any time part of the General Counsel's 13 A No, ma'am. 14 Q And why not?

15 A That's not the discussion in terms of when I elected 16 to take the position.

17 Q It was always reporting directly to Mr. Trump?

18 A Just to Mr. Trump. 19 Q So, in the course of your work for Mr. Trump at The 20 Trump Organization, did he ever ask you to renegotiate bills 21 for him?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Tell the jury, give us some examples of your 24 renegotiating bills and what you did.

25 A Well, for example, a law firm would send an invoice.

12 Office at The Trump Organization?

3269 1 He didn't believe that the invoice was fair, reasonable, 2 justified. And so, he would give me the task of renegotiating a 3 specific bill. 4 Q Did you ever renegotiate bills from other types of 5 vendors? 6 For example, regarding Trump University?

7 A Yes. 8 Q Tell us a little bit about that. 9 A So, Trump University fell into trouble, and there were 10 approximately 50 vendors that had not been paid. 11 There was a sum certain that was in the bank at the time.

12 Approximately $2 million. Unfortunately, the bills far exceeded 13 that $2 million. But, Trump was not going to fund the balance. 17 I contacted each and every one of the vendors; and all but 18 two accepted, ultimately, the 20 percent. 19 We had Releases drafted. And upon the receipt of the 20 Release, within 48 hours, we had checks sent to them by FedEx. 21 Q So, did Mr. Trump ask you to renegotiate all those 22 bills regarding Trump University? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And you said "all but two".

25 What happened with the other two vendors?

14 And so, what I did is I put them onto a spreadsheet, a 15 handwritten spreadsheet, divided it by the $2 million, and came 16 up with basically 20 percent of everyone's invoice.

1 A They just went away.

3270 2 Q You mean -- did you pay them? 3 A No, ma'am. 7 A Yes. But not in its totality. 8 Each and every Release was separate. I would go straight 9 into Mr. Trump's office, and I would advise him of the task 10 being accomplished. 11 Q Why did you do that?

12 A For two reasons. 13 The first was so that he knew I was on it and I was doing 14 what he had asked.

15 And the second was, really, to obtain credit so that he 16 understood that, again, I was accomplishing what he wanted.

17 Q Do you have a memory of advising him about 18 accomplishing that task of reducing the payments to vendors and 19 his reaction? Do you have a memory of that?

20 A Yes. 21 Q What do you remember him saying when you told him you 22 accomplished that task? 23 A "It's fantastic. It's great." 24 Q How did that make you feel?

25 A Like I was on top of the world.

4 Q Now, once you accomplished that task for Mr. Trump of 5 renegotiating all those bills with the Trump University, did 6 you report back to him?

3271 3 A Yes.

14 Q And explain why you did that.

15 A Well, it would depend on what the issue was.

17 contestant, who -- Mr. Trump was being defamed, the Miss 18 Universe Organization, so he brought an arbitration against 19 her. That matter, ultimately, got resolved.

20 If -- with the press, as an example, that if they said 21 something that angered him, I would reach out to the press, and 22 I would express to them their need to either redact or take the 23 article down or we would file an action against them. 24 Q Did you do that in a strong and threatening manner at 25 times?

6 other employees or executives to negotiate bills, not to take 7 the first bill, but to negotiate them down? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Let me ask you a question, Mr. Cohen. During the years 10 that you worked for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, did 11 you threaten, at times, to sue people or companies during those 12 years? 13 A Yes.

16 We had an issue, for example, with a Miss USA Pageant 1 Q Did you renegotiate other bills for Mr. Trump at The 2 Trump Organization, besides the ones that you just mentioned? 4 Q From your experience over the ten years working at The 5 Trump Organization, are you aware whether Mr. Trump directed 3272 1 A I would say so. Not all the time. But, often.

2 Q Now, you mentioned a bit about this. 3 During your time working for Mr. Trump at The Trump 4 Organization, did you also work on some personal matters for 5 him? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Can you just give us a brief example of some of that? 8 A So, one instance, his limousine was hit by a yellow 9 cab.

10 And, knowing that I had deep roots into the yellow cab 11 industry, he asked me to meet with the driver, who provided me 12 with the Police Report, and to have them pay for the repair on 13 the vehicle. 14 Q Did you ever do some personal work for -- regarding 15 his residence or his family, for example? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Tell us a little bit about that.

18 A In his apartment, they had a flood that ended up 19 causing damage into the main-floor bathroom. They had al fresco 20 on top. 21 And I handled the adjustment with the insurance company.

22 Q And these are all matters that Mr. Trump asked you to 23 handle for him? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Did you also, as part of your work -- and I think you 3273 1 mentioned this -- interact frequently with the press for him?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Tell us a little bit about that. 4 A Again, if it was in order to place a story that would 5 be advantageous in some way, shape or form, I would speak with 6 them.

7 If there was an article that caused him displeasure, I 8 would speak with them about that, as well. 9 Q So, did you work with the press to try to minimize 10 negative stories and sort of enhance positive stories about 11 Mr. Trump and his business?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Was that a good part of your work for him, interacting 14 with the press for him?

15 A It was a portion of it, yes. 16 Q Now, you mentioned that you worked at Trump Tower at 17 the Offices of The Trump Organization; is that right?

18 A That's correct. 19 Q During the time that you worked there, where, 20 approximately, was your office in relation to Mr. Trump's 21 office?

22 A Well, initially, when I started, it was towards the 23 back of the office that was Ivanka's old office, until, 24 ultimately, I moved to a different office that was maybe 25 50 feet, 60 feet from his office.

3274 1 Q During the time you worked there for Mr. Trump, 2 approximately how often would you say you met with him or spoke 3 with him? 4 A Every single day and multiple times per day.

5 Q And now we're talking about in the period before he 6 ran for President in 2016; is that right?

7 A Yes. 8 Q Now, at the time -- again, we're talking about 10 But, in general, explain how you communicated with him. 11 A Generally, it was either in person, on the cell phone, 12 or on the cell phone. Those are really -- those are the two 13 ways. 14 Q Understood.

15 Did you have all of his cell phone and other telephone 16 numbers in your contacts in your phone at the time?

17 A I did.

18 Q And you used all those variety of numbers as a way to 19 contact him?

20 A Yes. 21 Q When he called you, did he, generally, call you on 22 your cell phone or your work phone at The Trump Organization? 23 A Well, it was a combination of both. 24 Most of the time, it would be on my cell phone. Unless it 25 was in the office, he would have one of his assistants ring me 9 pre-2016.

3275 1 and ask me just to come to Mr. Trump's office.

2 Q Did you ever contact Mr. Trump by contacting somebody 3 else in order to get in contact with him? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Who did you contact at various times to reach him? 6 A Many people. It depends, also, who he was with at the 7 time. It could be Rhona, his Executive Assistant. Ultimately, 10 number of people. 11 Q And you had, for example, Keith Schiller's number in 12 your contacts, as well; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And Hope Hicks' number in your contacts, as well; and 15 you used those numbers in your contacts to make those calls; is 16 that right?

17 A Yes, ma'am.

18 Q As far as you know, did Mr. Trump use email to do his 19 work?

20 A No. 21 Mr. Trump never had an email address.

22 Q Did he ever comment to you about folks who 23 time-to-time get into trouble using email? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Can you tell us about that?

8 Keith Schiller, who was his personal attaché. It could be one 9 of the Trump children. It could be Hope Hicks. It was any 3276 1 A Yes.

2 During certain conversations, he would comment that emails 3 are like written papers, it's -- he knows too many people who 4 have gone down as a direct result of having emails that 5 prosecutors can use in a -- in a case. 6 Q When you say "going down", do you mean getting in some 7 sort of trouble? 8 A Yes, ma'am. 9 Q When you met him in person, you said -- where did you, 10 generally, meet him? 11 A In his office.

12 Q What times of day, generally, in his office? 13 A All throughout the day. 14 Q Were they sometimes early in the morning?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Sometimes later, towards the end of the day or even 17 early evening?

18 A Yes. 19 Q When you met him at the office, did you, generally, 20 meet in his office? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Did you need to make an appointment to go see him in 23 his office? 24 A No, ma'am.

25 Q Can you explain, was there -- what kind of a policy 3277 11 sorry.

16 matters that you were handling for him?

17 A Yes. It was actually required.

18 Q Tell us what you mean by that. 19 A When he would task you with something, he would then 20 say, "Keep me informed. Let me know what's going on." 21 And what he was saying, what everybody did is, as soon as 22 you had a result, an answer, you would go straight back and 23 tell him. Especially if it was a matter that was troubling to 24 him.

25 Q So, two things, just to break that down.

7 Q And others did the same, to your knowledge? 8 A To my knowledge, yes. 9 Q Now, when you met with Mr. Trump at The Trump 10 Organization, in his office, did you, generally, need -- I'm 12 Did you, generally, record those meetings in your calendar? 13 A No, ma'am. 14 Q As part of your work at The Trump Organization, did 15 you feel that it was part of your job to keep him updated on 1 was there at The Trump Organization about executives coming in 2 to meet with Mr. Trump? 3 A Mr. Trump had an open-door policy, which, if there was 4 somebody in there, you waited; and if not, you knocked on the 5 door, and I would say, "Boss, do you have a second?", and I 6 would walk right in.

3278 1 You said "everybody".

2 Do you mean you're aware of other executives who -- 3 A I apologize. 4 Yes. Other executives.

5 Q So, they would report back to him, as well? 6 A Yes.

7 Q But, you felt it was part of your job, and what he 8 wanted from you, to promptly report to him when you were 9 handling a matter for him about the progress and whether it was 10 resolved? 11 A Yes.And that's what I did.

12 Q Did you have a sense or did you learn from your 13 experiences with him that if you didn't keep him updated or 14 things didn't go well that you were working on, that that would 15 create an issue for Mr. Trump? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Can you explain that just a little bit?

18 A If you didn't immediately provide him with the 19 information and he learned of it in another manner, that 20 wouldn't go over well for you. 21 Q To the extent that you discussed the requirement to 22 report frequently to Mr. Trump, was it your sense, based on 23 working with him, that he was a micromanager about the work of 24 his organization and of which he was concerned?

25 A Yes, ma'am.

3279 1 Q Did you have a way of referring to Mr. Trump when you 2 worked for him? 3 A Yes. 4 Q What was that?

5 A I would call him "Boss", "Mr. Trump". 6 Q And in working for him for ten years, all the variety 10 A It was fantastic. It was -- working for him, 11 especially, during those ten years was -- (pause) -- an amazing 12 experience in many, many ways. There were great times. There 13 were several less than great times. But, for the most part, I 14 enjoyed the responsibilities that were given to me. I enjoyed 15 working with my colleagues at The Trump Organization, the Trump 16 children. It was a big family. 20 Q Why did you do that? 21 A Because it's what was needed in order to accomplish a 22 task. 23 Q Was there also a sense -- did you feel a sense of 24 obligation towards him, as well?

25 A Yes.

7 of the types of work that you did for him, what was it like for 8 you? How did you feel about working at The Trump Organization 9 during those years?

17 Q During the years that you worked for him at The Trump 18 Organization, did you at times lie for him? 19 A I did.

3280 1 Q Did you at times during your work for The Trump 2 Organization -- at The Trump Organization, for Mr. Trump, bully 3 people for him? 4 A Yes, ma'am.

5 Q Why did you do that? 6 A Again, in order to accomplish the task.

7 The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the 8 task to make him happy. 9 Q Now, over the years that you worked for him, did he 10 reward you with some additional titles? 11 A Yes.

12 Q What -- tell us just a little bit about that. 13 A Well, he placed me on the Board of the Miss Universe 14 Organization. There were three members: Mr. Trump, Allen 15 Weisselberg and myself. 16 Years later, myself and another colleague were made 17 Co-Presidents of Trump Productions.

18 I sat on the Board of four, five different Trump properties 19 as Treasurer.

20 Q Those were some of the additional titles that he 21 rewarded you with?

22 A Yes, ma'am. 23 Q Are you aware that in connection with your work for 24 him, some people described you as his "fixer"?

25 A Yes. Some have described me as that.

3281 1 Q From your perspective, is that in some ways an 2 accurate title, an accurate moniker? 3 A It's fair. 4 Q I just want to ask you some questions about your 21 number; is that right?

22 A That's correct. 23 Q Was that 212-836-3212? 24 A Yes, ma'am.

25 Q Obviously, you no longer use that number?

5 telephone numbers, and I'm going to ask you only about the last 6 four digits of some of those numbers.

7 During the period of 2015 to 2017, when you were working at 8 The Trump Organization, did you use a cell phone number ending 9 in 6866?

10 A I did. 11 Q Did you also use a cell phone number ending in 0114?

12 A I did. 13 Q And did you continue to use those two numbers for a 14 period of time after you left The Trump Organization?

15 A Yes, ma'am. 16 Q Do you still continue to this day to use the cell 17 phone number ending 0114?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Now, during the time that you worked at The Trump 20 Organization for Mr. Trump, you also had a landline work 3282 1 A No, ma'am.

2 Q After you left The Trump Organization, did you also 3 have a number associated with a law firm in New York? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Was that 212-872-9849? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Obviously, you don't still use that number? 8 A No, ma'am. 9 Q In connection with the investigation of this case, did 10 our Office ask you to provide two cell phones that you had used 11 for a period of time up until April of 2018?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And did you agree to provide those two cell phones to 14 us that you had previously used with the two numbers -- cell 15 phone numbers that I just mentioned, ending in 0114 and 6866? 16 A Yes, I did.

17 Q Did you provide those phones to us in January of 2023?

18 A Sounds correct. Yes.

21 A Yes. Merely the request.

22 Q Did you consent to do that voluntarily? 23 A I did. 24 Q Now, you keep contacts on your phones; there were 25 contacts that were kept on those phones; is that right?

19 Q And was that pursuant to our request that you turned 20 those over to us?

3283 1 A That's correct.

2 Q What kind of information, just generally, was in your 3 contacts on those phones? 4 A Names, email addresses, potential addresses, cell 5 phone numbers, home numbers, fax numbers. 6 Q Were there also, sometimes, other information 7 associated with folks whose contacts you had in there? 8 A Yes, ma'am. 9 Q Did you keep anybody else's contacts in your phone, as 10 well? 11 A Personal ones, yes.

12 Q In other words, however -- what I'm asking about is 13 not just your contacts, of your contacts and the folks that you 14 know; but, did you also, at some point, include or sync with 15 your contacts somebody else's contacts? 16 A I did.

17 Q Tell the jury about that.

18 A Actually, I didn't do it. It was done by the IT 19 people.

20 I was spending a significant amount of time with Mr. Trump; 21 and we ultimately decided -- he agreed -- to have his contact 22 numbers synced to my cell number, to my account as well. 23 That way, if we needed to travel, if he needed to get 24 somebody on the phone, he would just say, "Michael, get me" so 25 and so "on the line," and I would have them in my cell phone.

3284 1 Q As a result of this syncing process, did your personal 2 contacts also end up in his phone? 3 A I'm not certain about that. 4 Q You're not certain.

5 Just his contacts in your phone? 6 A Yes, ma'am.

7 Q Do you remember, approximately, when you synced or 10 Q As a result of having both your contacts and 11 Mr. Trump's contacts in your phone, did you have over 30,000 12 contacts in your phone? 14 Q During the time you worked at The Trump Organization 15 for Mr. Trump, was your email address mcohen@trumporg.com? 16 A Yes, it was.

17 Q After you left The Trump Organization, during the 18 years of 2017 and 2018, did you also use another email address, 19 mcohen@mdpc.com?

20 A Yes. 21 Q You no longer have that email address; is that right?

22 A That's correct. 23 Q Did you also use a personal Gmail address that you 24 still currently use?

25 A Yes.

13 A Yes, ma'am.

8 someone else synced his contacts into your phone, if you know? 9 A I don't. I don't.

3285

1 Q Mr. Cohen, do you know someone named David Pecker?

2 A I do.
3 Q Who is he, and how do you know him? 4 A I knew David Pecker before I even knew Mr. Trump.

5 We had mutual friends, and we had met at a function at -- 6 out in Long Island. Many, many years ago.

7 I then was re-acquainted with David Pecker, who is the 8 President, CEO of AMI. Most people know him more from his 9 magazines and his newspapers: National Enquirer, Star, Okay!

10 and Men's Health, et cetera. 11 Q When you -- did you, from time to time, speak to 12 Mr. Pecker even before he came -- before you started at The 13 Trump Organization? 14 A Not regularly, no.

15 Q Once you were at The Trump Organization and introduced 16 to him again by Mr. Trump, did you speak to him from time to 17 time?

18 A Yes. 19 Q When you spoke to him, did you speak to him by phone?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Did you have his cell phone and work numbers in your 22 phone contacts? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Did you use those contacts to speak with him?

25 A Yes, ma'am.

3286 1 Q At times, did you also speak with Mr. Pecker using an 2 encrypted application called Signal? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Why did you do that?

5 A Well, depending upon the matter, sometimes we thought 6 that encryption, not having the event traceable would be 7 beneficial.

11 A Yes, ma'am.

12 Q And did you also, at times, communicate with 13 Mr. Pecker by email? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And you had his email address, as well, in your 16 contacts; is that right?

17 A Yes, ma'am.

18 Q Now, did you speak with Mr. Pecker at The Trump 19 Organization about matters having to do with Mr. Trump prior to 20 June of 2015? 21 A Yes, but rarely.

22 Q And was it -- what sort of matters were the few 23 matters that you spoke to him about, if you can remember, prior 24 to 2015?

25 A There was some things that had come up.

8 Q Was it because it was something you wanted to keep 9 confidential and didn't want anybody to be able to trace it or 10 look into those communications?

3287 1 For example, Mr. Trump had donated money to a charity. It 2 was Harlem for Hoops. We had come into information that they 3 had no funding, and I brought it to Mr. Trump's attention. 4 He said, "Yes," we wanted to get the story out.

5 So, it would be things like that. And -- 6 Q To try to get a nice -- a good story out about him?

7 A A good story, yes. 8 Q And -- to your knowledge, prior to 2015, when 9 Mr. Trump announced that he was running for the Presidency, did 10 you know whether Mr. Pecker or AMI ever paid for public stories 11 to prevent them from becoming public?

12 A There were stories. 13 Q I apologize. 14 My question is quite wrong.

15 Prior to Mr. Trump announcing his run for the Presidency, 16 are you aware of AMI ever paying to suppress stories?

17 A No, ma'am.

18 Q Would you say you had a good relationship with 19 Mr. Pecker?

20 A I would, yes. 21 Q Did you know someone named Dylan Howard?

22 A I do. 23 Q Who was Dylan Howard? 24 A Dylan Howard was an employee over at AMI.

25 Q What was your understanding about what his role was at 3288 1 AMI, if you knew?

2 A He worked for Mr. Pecker to the same extent that I 3 worked for Mr. Trump. 4 Q Did you speak with Mr. Howard in person or, generally, 5 by phone? 6 A I spoke to everybody in three different manners: by 8 Q Did you have Mr. Dylan's [sic] phone numbers and 10 A Yes, ma'am. 11 Q Did you use those numbers to contact him?

13 Q Now, at times, did you also communicate with 14 Mr. Howard using that encrypted application, Signal?

15 A Yes, ma'am. 16 Q And why did you choose to do that with your 17 communications with Mr. Howard?

18 A For the same reason. It was a sensitive matter that we 19 wanted to keep private.

20 Q Did you also communicate by text with Mr. Howard? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And sometimes by email? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Again, using your contacts that you had in your phone?

25 A Yes, ma'am.

9 contacts in your contacts in your phone?

12 A I did.

7 phone, by email, and in person.

3289 1 Q Did there come a time, in 2011, that Mr. Trump was 2 exploring a run for the Presidency? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Can you tell us a little bit about that?

5 A So, in 2011, I had come across, while reading the 6 paper, a poll that stated 6 percent of all the people who had 19 And it was further proof that his name recognition, his 24 his considering a run for the Presidency in 2011?

25 A Yes.

11 He said, "It's interesting. We should look into it."
12 Q And did he look into it in some degree in 2011? 13 A He did. 14 Q Do you recall whether he spoke publicly in 2011 about 15 exploring a run for the Presidency? 16 A He did.

17 That was posts I had created for him, my own website called 18 shouldtrumprun.com. And many people came to that website.

20 popularity, especially because of the hit show The Apprentice, 21 was so strong.

22 Q And just to go back to the question, do you remember 23 giving some public speech -- him giving public speeches about 7 taken the poll thought Mr. Trump should be President of the 8 United States of America. 9 And so, I took that article, and I brought it to Mr. Trump.

10 And I said, "What do you think?"
3290 1 Q Were those, if you recall, covered in the news?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Did he, ultimately, decide to run for the Presidency 4 in 2011?

5 A No. 6 Q What was your understanding why he decided not to run?

7 A There were several large real estate projects he 8 acquired, as well as another season of The Apprentice. 9 And, as Mr. Trump told me, "You don't leave Hollywood.

10 Hollywood leaves you." 11 Q So, he decided to stay and do that work instead?

12 A Yes, ma'am. 13 Q Did there come a time, then, in June of 2015, when 14 Mr. Trump announced that he was running for President?

15 A Yes. 16 Q And how did he make that announcement, if you recall?

17 A I do.

18 It was at The Atrium at Trump Tower. He came down the 19 stairs to the lowest level. And we had set up a podium. He made 20 the announcement and a speech. 21 Q Now, at the time, in June of 2015, were you -- or any 22 time -- an official paid member of Mr. Trump's campaign? 23 A No. 24 Q Nevertheless, did you assist Mr. Trump in his 25 campaign?

3291 1 A So, just some colorfulness.

2 In 2011, when Mr. Trump decided not to run, he actually 3 promised me that he was going to do it in the next election 4 cycle. And for years thereafter, we would talk about him 5 running in 2015.

13 campaign? 14 A I wasn't going to be part of it.

15 I was just going to be a surrogate. 16 Q Explain what you mean by "surrogate".

17 A Sure.

18 "Surrogate" was someone who speaks on behalf of the 19 candidate and defends him in the press. Speaks to the press, 20 provides color, but not as a member of the campaign, but, 21 rather, as an outside person. So, again, as to give the 22 appearance that it's unbiased. 23 Q And that's the role that you performed for him and for 24 the campaign?

25 A Yes.

6 At the very beginning, when he ultimately said, "I'm doing 7 it," there was a lot of back and forth about which date the 8 announcement should be. 9 A very small group of people were attached to the campaign 10 when it first launched. 11 Q Did you have some discussions directly with Mr. Trump 12 about what your role might be in terms of assisting with his 3292 1 Q And did you make public appearances for him and for 2 his campaign? 3 A I did. 4 Q Tell us a little bit about that. What kind of public 5 appearances? 6 A I would make public appearances on television, CNN,
7 MSNBC, ABC, whoever, CBS. I would frequently provide comment to 8 press regarding different matters that kept popping up. 9 Q Did you leverage your press contacts in that way, from 10 Mr. Trump's campaign? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Your relationships? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Did you also develop some relationships with some key 15 people on behalf of the campaign who put together some kind of 16 committees or groups for him?

17 A Yes.

18 Q Tell the jury a little bit about that. 19 A So, while watching the rallies, I had gone to 20 Mr. Trump, and I said, "One of the things that I notice is that 21 it's very white. And we really need diversity. If you're going 22 to win, you're going to need diversity." 23 And so, I started a group called National Diversity 24 Coalition for Trump, along with Pastor Carol Scott, an 25 Evangelical Pastor from Cleveland, Ohio.

3293 1 Q And you did that for his campaign; is that right?

2 A I did. 3 Q Did you have other important contacts in the Christian 4 Evangelical community that you sort of worked with for 5 Mr. Trump? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Did you have a campaign email address, by the way? 8 A Yes. I was given a campaign email address.

19 attend that announcement?

20 A I did. 21 Q Did you invite other people, as well?

22 A I did. 23 Q Now, sometime after the announcement in June, in about 24 August of 2015, did you and Mr. Trump meet with David Pecker at 25 Trump Tower to discuss what AMI could do for the campaign?

12 A Yes. 13 Q What -- generally, what did he say, in substance? 14 A You know, that, "When this comes out," meaning the 15 announcement, "just be prepared. There's going to be a lot of 16 women coming forward."
17 Q Now, turning back to his announcement of running for 18 the Presidency in June of 2015, did you invite David Pecker to 9 Q Around the time that the campaign began, did Mr. Trump 10 express to you any concern about negative stories about his 11 personal life that might affect his candidacy?

3294 1 A Yes, ma'am.

2 Q Where exactly did the three of you meet? 3 A Mr. Trump's office on the 26th floor. 4 Q Could you tell the jury, please, what was discussed 5 and what was agreed to at that meeting? 6 A What was discussed was the power of the National 7 Enquirer in terms of being located at the cash register of so 11 candidates, that would also be beneficial.

14 A Yeah.

15 Q What, in substance, did he say? 16 A What he said was that he could keep an eye out for 17 anything negative about Mr. Trump, and that he would be able to 18 help us to know in advance what was coming out and try to stop 19 it from coming out.

20 Q And who did he say he would get in touch with if 21 his -- he was able to identify those types of stories?

22 A The answer was: Me. 23 Mr. Trump also. 24 Knowing my relationship with David, "The two of you should 25 work together. And anything negative that comes , you let 8 many supermarkets and bodegas; that if we can place positive 9 stories about Mr. Trump, that would be beneficial; that if we 10 could place negative stories about some of the other 12 Q Was there anything else that Mr. Pecker said he could 13 also do for Mr. Trump's candidacy?

3295 1 Michael know, and we'll handle it."
2 Q Now, during -- subsequent to that meeting, during the 3 campaign, did AMI run stories that were positive for Mr. Trump? 4 A Yes, ma'am.

5 Q And did they run stories that were negative on 6 Mr. Trump's opponents?

7 A Yes, ma'am. 8 Q And in the course of that, did AMI preview for 9 Mr. Trump and for you some of those stories that they were 10 gonna run in their magazines and periodicals? 11 A Yes, ma'am.

12 Q Can you describe just a few that you recall that they 13 ran, specifically to benefit Mr. Trump, some stories that were 14 either negative on his opponents or positive for him?

15 A So, some of the negative ones that I would receive 16 from David or from Dylan Howard was Hillary Clinton wearing 17 very thick glasses and some allegations that she had some brain 18 injury. 19 There was Ted Cruz, a photo of his father with Lee Harvey 20 Oswald, claiming that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the 21 assassination of JFK.

24 binge of some sort.

25 Q Did AMI sometimes send over the covers of some of 22 There was an article on Marco Rubio in a swimming pool with 23 a bunch of other men, claiming that they were having a drug 3296 1 these stories to you before they ran them?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And what did you do with that material when they sent 4 it over to you?

5 A Immediately showed it to Mr. Trump. 6 Q And for what purpose did you show it to Mr. Trump?

7 A So that he knew that David was loyal, was on board, 17 A Yes.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show, please, People's 19 Exhibit 166, which is in evidence.

20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 21 Q Are you able to read that, Mr. Cohen?

22 A Yes, ma'am. 23 Q Do you recognize, generally, this email? 24 A I do.

25 Q Can you just tell the jury a little bit about what 8 was doing everything that he said he was going to do in that 9 August meeting and was actually doing it.

10 Q And do you recall, from time to time, when you showed 11 Mr. Trump some of those stories, what his -- in general, his 12 reactions were? 13 A "That's fantastic. That's unbelievable." 14 Q Now, did AMI ever actually seek your input into the 15 types of stories or the content of some of the stories that 16 they were gonna run?

3297 1 this email was?

2 A This is an email from me, Trump Org, on January 6, 3 2016, to Barry Levine and cc'd to Dylan Howard. 4 Barry Levine was an employee, as well, at AMI.

5 Q Did Barry Levine send you something in this email? 6 A Yes.

7 Q What did he send you? 8 A He sent to me an email that says: "Michael: 9 Greetings and happy new year. As our readers can't get enough 10 of Mr. Trump, we are repackaging and repurposing past material 11 from our files and adding additional material -- of course also 12 of a positive nature."
18 Barry Levine? 19 Q And you copied Dylan Howard on it.

20 Read your response. 21 A I stated: "Yes. Take out the part of the Penthouse 22 pet Sandra as it offers nothing. Also, I would like to reword 23 the part about Atlantic City. Let's speak tomorrow." 24 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 25 relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the 15 Q He's describing the content of some of these articles? 16 A Yes.

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the top email to 13 Then goes on. There's a series of bullet points. 14 "Donald has quietly given away" --
3298 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
5 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
6 Q Why did you ask AMI to remove the Penthouse pet 7 reference?

8 A I thought it would be negative to Mr. Trump as, again, 9 it dealt with women and Penthouse.

10 Q And did AMI agree to make the edits that you 11 suggested? 12 A Yes, ma'am. 13 Q What is the title of the story?

14 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you just scroll down just a 15 little bit.

16 Thank you so much. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q The title of that story -- can you see what the title 19 of that story was going to be, was it: "The Trump that Nobody 20 Knows?" 21 A Yes. It was going to go under the headline "The Donald 22 Trump Nobody Knows."
23 Q And, I'm sorry, would you say again what the date of 24 this email was? 25 A January 6th of 2016.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3299 3300 1 Q Okay.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: And can we now take that down and 3 put up People's 152 in evidence. 4 (Displayed.) 5 Q And can we direct your attention to the article 7 MS. HOFFINGER: And maybe you can just center on 10 Q Did this article actually come out -- 11 A Yes, ma'am. 12 Q -- that you spoke to AMI about? 13 A I'm sorry. 14 Q That's all right. 15 You said that the email that you sent was either January 6th 16 of 2016 -- and what's the date of this article here? 17 A It was posted on January 13th of 2016.

18 Q So, about a week later, AMI ran the article with your 19 suggestions? 20 A Yes, ma'am. 21 Q And is this an example of your working with AMI to get 22 articles out that benefitted Mr. Trump's campaign? 23 A It is an example. 24 Q And this was consistent with what was discussed at the 25 Trump Tower meeting with Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 that. 9 (Displayed.) 6 entitled "The Trump Nobody Knows."
3301 1 A Yes.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 3 We can take that down. 4 Q Now, in the Fall of 2015, did you come to learn of a 5 negative story being circulated by a former doorman at Trump 6 Tower? 7 A Yes, ma'am. 8 Q And how did you learn of that story? 9 A I was told of the story by either David Pecker or Dylan 10 Howard. 11 Q And, very briefly, what was the nature of the story 12 that they indicated to you was out there circulating? 13 A That there was a love child. 15 circulating, that they heard about the doorman who had this 16 story; right? 17 A Yes, ma'am.

18 Q After you learned of the story, did you speak to 19 Mr. Trump about it? 20 A I did. 21 Q Why did you do that? 22 A Well, I went to him immediately to advise him that 23 there was a story, because it was a negative story for him, and 24 to get his direction on what he wanted me to do. 25 Q Did you indicate to him at the time the name of the Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 14 Q Actually, I think I take my question back about the 3302 1 employees who were referenced in this potential story?

2 A Yes. I provided him with all of the information. 3 Q And did it involve actually two employees at The Trump 4 Organization? 5 A Yes, ma'am. 6 Q Who were married to each other? 7 A Yes. 8 Q Did Mr. Trump -- can you describe your conversation 9 that you had with Mr. Trump when you advised him of this?

11 A He told me to: Make sure that this story doesn't get 12 out. You handle it. 13 Q Did he ask you, also, to do anything with respect to 14 the affected employees? 15 A Yes. 16 Q What did he say, in substance? 17 A He asked me to speak to them and let them know it's 18 being taken care of. 19 Q Now, what did you do in terms of, at that point, in 20 terms of making sure that the story didn't get out? 21 A I worked with David Pecker and Dylan Howard. 22 Q And you worked with them to do what? 23 A In order to obtain the story, all of the life rights to 24 the story. 25 Q Who did you understand was going to either purchase or Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 10 What did he tell you to do?

3303 1 try to take care of -- well, take care of purchasing the life 2 rights to the story or otherwise making sure that the story 3 didn't get out? 4 A David Pecker. 5 Q And, along the way, did either Dylan Howard or David 6 Pecker update you about what they were doing with respect to 7 that story? 8 A Yes, ma'am. 9 Q And as the matter progressed and you got updates from 10 Dylan Howard or David Pecker, did you update Mr. Trump about the 11 matter? 12 A Immediately. 13 Q Now, at some point, did you learn that AMI had entered 14 into an Agreement with the doorman regarding this story? 15 A Yes. 16 Q What did you learn, just briefly, about what the 17 general terms were of the Agreement that AMI entered into with 18 this particular doorman? 19 A That they were going to pay $30,000. They were 20 executing an Agreement with the doorman in order to obtain the 21 life rights to this story. 22 Q And when you say "to obtain the life rights," was it to 23 publish the story or not publish the story? 24 A It was to not publish the story. 25 Q But to control the life rights so that nobody else Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3304 1 could publish it?

2 A Correct. Take it off the market. 3 Q Now, did you update -- actually, when Dylan Howard and 4 Mr. Pecker told you they were going to do that, they were going 5 to acquire the life rights for $30,000, did you tell them that 6 Mr. Trump would be grateful?

7 A Absolutely. 8 Q And when you spoke to Mr. Trump about it, was he 9 grateful?

10 A Absolutely. 11 Q Now, did AMI at some point send you the Agreement --
12 their agreement with the doorman for those life rights for 13 $30,000? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And did you review it? 16 A I did.

17 Q Why did you review it?

18 A Well, I reviewed it to ensure that Mr. Trump was fully 19 protected.

20 I also asked them to send it to me so that I could show 21 Mr. Trump that it's being taken care of.

22 Q And did you -- when you reviewed that Agreement, did 23 you provide AMI with any feedback about the terms in the 24 Agreement?

25 A I did.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3305 1 Q What did you tell them?

2 A Ummm, I thought that there needed to be a clause in 3 there, a significant penalty for a million dollars per violation 4 of any of the terms of the Agreement to ensure that the doorman 5 knew not to go ahead and to talk about this matter. 6 Q So, you suggested that there be a heavy hammer to make 7 sure that he didn't break the terms of the Agreement? 8 A Yes, ma'am. 9 Q Did you also suggest some other term involving 10 perpetuity for this Agreement? 11 A Yes. 12 Q Can you explain that? 13 A What I found was that the Agreement had what I 14 considered to be an end date to it. 15 And so, rather, I said why not just -- let's make this in 16 perpetuity. 17 Q What does that mean, "in perpetuity?"
18 A It means that it's forever. That he owns the 19 document -- they own the story forever. And it can never come 20 out. 21 Q And did AMI agree to include that term as well in the 22 Agreement? 23 A He did. 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up, please, People's 165 25 in evidence.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3306 1 (Displayed.)
2 Q And can you -- do you recognize that email, first of 3 all? 4 A I do. 5 Q Who is it from and who is it to? 6 A It's from Dylan Howard on December 19th of 2015 to me 7 at the Trump Org, with the subject headline of "Update." 8 It reads: "Michael, it was remiss of me not to contact you 9 yesterday. We were on deadline for the magazines.

10 Nevertheless, I wanted to confirm that the source executed an 11 Addendum to the Agreement with a liquidated damages clause. He 12 has been compensated accordingly. Cheers, Dylan." 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we also put up now People's 155 14 in evidence.

19 Q Do you recognize that, Mr. Cohen? 20 A I do, ma'am. 18 (Displayed.)
17 a little bit. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Is it possible to blow that up just 21 Q What is that? 22 A This is the Amendment that I was just describing. 23 Q And is that the Amendment that contains the 24 million-dollar liquidation clause and the clause about it 25 continuing in perpetuity?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 15 (Displayed.)
3307 1 A Yes, that would be Sections 2 and 3 of the Amendment.

2 Q Now, once that was accomplished by AMI and they 3 included the terms that you wanted to protect Mr. Trump, did you 4 advise Mr. Trump that you had gotten that done? 5 A Yes, ma'am. 6 Q Why did you tell him that? 7 A Again, in order to ensure that he knows that David's 8 doing exactly what he said he would. Also for credit. 9 Q In terms of credit, did you tell him that you got the 10 million dollars put in and the in perpetuity clause put in? 11 A Yes. 12 Q Why did you do that? 13 A In order to get credit for accomplishing the task. 14 Q And was -- what was Mr. Trump's reaction when you told 15 him that? 16 A It's great. "That's great." 17 Q Now, is it your understanding that AMI bought the life 18 rights to the doorman's story as part of what Mr. Pecker had 19 agreed to at the Trump Tower meeting with you and Mr. Trump in 20 August 2015? 21 A Yes. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: You could take that down. 23 Thank you so much. 24 Q Let me direct your attention now to June of 2016.

25 And around that time, did you learn that a woman by the name Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter
3308 1 of Karen McDougal was looking to sell a story regarding her 2 relationship with Mr. Trump? 3 A Yes, ma'am. 4 Q And how did you learn that? 5 A Again, I received a call from David Pecker or Dylan 6 Howard. 7 Q And what, generally, did they tell you, just briefly, 8 in substance, about what this story was about? 9 A That she's a Playboy Playmate and that there is a story 10 that is looking to be sold on the street -- to news outlets 11 about a relationship that she had had with Mr. Trump. 12 Q And when you learned of the story, what, if anything, 13 did you think about its potential impact on Mr. Trump's 14 Presidential campaign? 15 A Significant. 16 Q Did you tell Mr. Trump what you had learned from AMI 17 about Karen McDougal?

18 A Immediately after I got off the phone with AMI. 19 Q And can you tell us about the conversation you had with 20 Mr. Trump after learning about that story? 21 A So, I went to the office, knocked on it, I said: 22 "Boss, I got to talk to you." 23 He said: "Come in." 24 I went in. I told him about what I had just learned.

25 I asked him if he knew who Karen McDougal was, if he knows Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter
3309 1 anything about the story.

2 His response to me was: "She's really beautiful." 6 with Mr. Trump, did you draw any conclusion based on his 7 response to you? 8 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 9 THE COURT: Sustained.

10 Q Did Mr. Trump ask you to take any action with respect 11 to the story? 12 A Yes. 13 Q What did he ask you, in general, to do? 17 A We need to -- we need to acquire the story. And so I
18 went ahead and I reached back out to both Dylan Howard as well 19 as to David Pecker. 20 Q Now, during the time period of about June of -- maybe 21 June 16th or so of 2016 to August 5th of 2016, did you 22 communicate frequently, regularly, with Mr. Pecker and 23 Mr. Howard regarding Karen McDougal? 24 A Yes, ma'am. 25 Q Why did you do that?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3 I said: "Okay. But there is a story that's right now being 4 shopped." 5 Q And did you draw on any -- based on your experience 14 A Make sure it doesn't get released. 15 Q What did you do as a result? What did you take that to 16 mean you should do?

3310 1 A Again, ummm, the purpose is to stop the story from 2 being sold or marketed to an outside source. 3 Q Did you want to make sure that AMI was doing that? 4 A Absolutely. 5 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Sustained. 7 Q How did you communicate -- well, let me ask you a 8 question: Did AMI regularly update you about what was happening 9 with their negotiations in terms of the story?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And was that consistent with what they had -- David 12 Pecker had agreed to do at Trump Tower, to notify you if matters 13 like this were happening? 14 A Yes. 15 Q How did you communicate with David Pecker and Dylan 16 Howard during this time? 17 A Again, it would either be by phone, text, email, app.

18 Q Okay. When you say "app", sometimes using the Signal 19 app? 20 A Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry. The Signal app. 21 Q That's okay. 22 Let me just finish the question and then you answer, because 23 the court reporter also needs to get it down. 24 A I'm sorry. 25 Q And did you use for this transaction that you were Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3311 1 working with AMI, did you use the Signal app?

2 A I believe so. 3 Q And why was that? 7 either Dylan Howard or David Pecker about the progress with 11 People's Exhibit 177A, which is also in evidence. 12 (Displayed.) 13 Q Now, I'm just going to ask you: Do you recognize these 14 texts between yourself and Dylan Howard during this time period 15 from about June 16th of 2016 to November 1st of 2016? 17 Q My apologies.

18 Do you recognize these texts during the time period that's 19 referenced in this exhibit? 20 A I do. 21 Q Let's take a look at, first, please, the text with 22 Dylan Howard on June 16th of 2016. 23 (Displayed.) 24 Q Can you read out for the jury all of the texts from 25 June 16th of 2016. And along the way, you can tell the jury Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 A Yes. 8 Karen McDougal, did you update Mr. Trump frequently?

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up now, please, 16 A I think it says here June 20th of 2016.

4 A Again, because of the nature of the issue, to make sure 5 that it remained private. 6 Q At various times when you were receiving updates from 3312 1 what they refer to and what they mean.

2 A So, this is a June 16th of 2016 communication between 3 Dylan Howard and myself, and it states: "Meeting will be on 4 Monday, per their terms. Dylan."
5 Q And what's your response? 6 A My response back was: "Understood. Thank you for 7 everything." 8 Q What did you understand this was about in terms of the 9 meeting on their terms?

10 A This is about meeting with Karen McDougal and her 11 people.

12 Q Now, let me direct your attention -- what is -- again, 13 what is the date of this? 14 A The date is June 16th of 2016.

16 moment and show People's Exhibit 262 in evidence.

17 (Displayed.)
18 Q I want to -- do you recognize these texts with Keith 19 Schiller, between yourself and Keith Schiller?

20 A I do. 21 Q Now, you recall that you told the jury that sometimes 22 you spoke to or contacted Keith Schiller in order to get in 23 touch with Mr. Trump? 24 A Yes.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we look at Page 2, please, Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 15 MS. HOFFINGER: And can we take that down for a 3313 1 lines 16 to 20, dated June 16th of 2016.

4 Q Mr. Cohen, can you read those texts between yourself 6 A Yes, ma'am.

9 Q And what does he respond?

10 A He then responds -- I didn't receive -- 11 Q His response?

12 A I didn't receive a response back. 13 And so, I followed it up with another that says: "You 14 there?"
15 He then responds to me: "On Dallas."
17 I then respond to him: "Where's The Boss?" Which, of 18 course, referenced Mr. Trump. 19 He then responds to me: "Next to me."
20 And then, I then ask: "Is he free to speak?" 21 Q Why are you trying to reach Mr. Trump on this date of 22 June 16, 2016? 23 A Regarding the Karen McDougal matter. 24 Q Was it an update that -- in response to an update that 25 you had just received from Dylan Howard about a meeting with Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 2 Can you see if we can cull those out. 3 (Displayed.)
5 and Keith Schiller on that same day, June 16th of 2016?

7 So, this is from me to Keith Schiller, asking: "Can we 8 speak? I need you."
16 I think he meant in Dallas.

3314 1 Karen McDougal's people?

2 A Yes, that I thought was important. 3 Q Is this an example of you contacting Mr. Trump to give 4 him updates about what was progressing with Karen McDougal?

5 A Yes, ma'am. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

7 Can we now put up People's 349 in evidence. 9 Q And take a look at the call on 6/16 of 2016. Do you 10 recognize these? 11 These are calls between yourself and Mr. Trump, summary 12 calls.

15 Q -- for 2 minutes and 31 seconds. 16 Did you have that call with Mr. Trump right after you asked 18 speak?

17 Keith Schiller if he was available -- meaning Mr. Trump -- to 19 A Yes.

20 Q And what do you believe that you discussed with 21 Mr. Trump on that call?

22 A The updates that I received on the Karen McDougal 23 matter. 24 Q Thank you.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 (Displayed.)
13 Do you see a call between the two of you at 6:51 p.m. -- 14 A Yes, ma'am.

3315 1 Can we go back now, please, to People's 2 Exhibit 177A in evidence. 3 And can we cull out the texts on June 20th of 2016. 4 And blow those up for Mr. Cohen. 5 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 6 (Displayed.) 7 Q Can you start with the texts from Dylan Howard that 8 says: "I'm about to meet her. Her name is Karen McDougal." 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 Q "Former Playboy Playmate." 11 A So, I received a series of messages. 12 This one is dated Monday, June 20th of 2016, whereby 13 Dylan Howard sends to me: "I'm about to meet with her. Her 14 name is Karen McDougal, former Playboy Playmate." 15 I then respond to Mr. Howard: "Okay. We need to speak." 17 I then -- he then responds to me again: "When we break."
18 And I respond back: "Okay." 19 He then sends to me a response: Spoke -- it says "spike" 20 but it means "Spoke to DP" -- referencing David Pecker -- "We 21 just broke. I'm wrapping up with them. And then we will 22 convene a three-way call between us all to sort this out. 23 Understand I've got this locked down for you." I won't let it 24 get out of my grasp -- "I won't let it out of my grasp." 25 Q Now, did you insist, at this time, on having a call Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 16 He then responds to me: "Yes."
3316 1 with Dylan Howard right after he met with Karen McDougal?

2 A Yes, ma'am. 3 Q And why did you do that? 4 A Because I needed to get an update so I could provide it 5 to Mr. Trump. 6 Q And shortly after these updates from Mr. Howard, did 7 you actually have a call with both Dylan Howard and David Pecker 8 to find out about their interview with Karen McDougal? 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 Q And what was the substance of what they told you during 11 that three-person call about progress with Karen McDougal? 12 A That they believed that they have this under control, 13 as Dylan had stated to me: "I will get this locked down for 14 you. And I won't let it out of my grasp." 15 Q Did Dylan Howard tell you what his opinion was about 16 whether he believed that Karen McDougal had had a relationship 17 with Mr. Trump?

18 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 19 THE COURT: Sustained. 20 Q Was it important for you to have that call with Dylan 21 Howard and David Pecker? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And that's to make sure that things were being taken 24 care of for Mr. Trump? 25 A Yes.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3317 1 Q Did you have another call later that night with 2 Mister -- with Dylan Howard to have some further conversations 3 about the progress of the deal? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Now, you said you did update Mr. Trump on the progress 6 at that point with Karen McDougal?

7 A Yes, ma'am.

10 A I don't recall. 11 Q I'm going to direct your attention now to a little bit 12 later in June, a little later in June of 2016, maybe a week or 13 so, around the same time. 14 Did you -- were you present for a conversation that 15 Mr. Trump had directly with David Pecker about the Karen 16 McDougal matter?

17 A Yes, ma'am.

18 Q Where were you when you were present for, and 19 overheard, that conversation?

20 A In Mr. Trump's office. 21 Q And who else was in the office besides yourself and 22 Mr. Trump? 23 A (No response.) 24 Q It was just the two of you?

25 A I believe so, yes.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 Q And do you know whether at that time that update was 9 either in person or by telephone?

3318

1 Q And did he have a call at that point with Mr. Pecker?

2 A Yes.
3 Q How did he make that call? 4 A He had the call put through, and he had a speaker box 5 on his desk, and instead of lifting up the phone, he used the 6 speaker box so I was able to hear. 7 Q And can you tell the jury about what you recall from 8 that conversation that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Pecker? 9 A He asked him how things were going with the matter.

10 And David said, "We have this under control. And we will -- 11 we will take care of this." 12 Q Was there a discussion on that call about how much it 13 might cost to buy this story and who might pay for it? 14 A Yes, ma'am. 15 Q Just, in substance, what was that conversation? 16 A So, David had stated that it's going to cost them 17 $150,000 to control the story, to which Mr. Trump replied: "No 18 problem. I will take care of it." 19 Q Was there an understanding about who would initially 20 purchase that story? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And who was discussed on that call that would purchase 23 that story? 24 A AMI was going to lay out the funds, and as Mr. Trump 25 had stated to David: "I will take care of it."
 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3319

1 Q And what did you understand that to mean?
2 A He was going to pay it back. 3 Q But it wasn't -- was it described at that point how 4 that might occur?

5 A No, ma'am. 6 Q After that call, did you then have a call or call 7 Mr. Pecker? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And tell us a little bit about that conversation that 10 you had with Mr. Pecker? 11 A I just wanted to make sure that I was being updated 12 regarding the entire matter. 13 Q Did you let him know on that call that you had 14 overheard that conversation that he had with Mr. Trump?

15 A Yes. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, let's put back up, if we 17 could, please, 177A, Mr. Cohen's texts with Dylan Howard.

18 And now the texts on July 28th of 2016 through 19 July 29th of 2016.

20 And let's see if we can cull those out for 21 Mr. Cohen to read.

22 (Displayed.) 23 A So it's Thursday, July 28th of 2016. It's from me to 24 Dylan Howard: "Can you call me?"
25 Dylan Howard responds back: "I've not heard back from our Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3320 1 guy yet so no update. Let me call him this a.m. and get latest.

2 Does that work?" 3 Q Who did you understand his "guy" to be? 4 A I believe it was Keith Davidson. 5 Q And who was Keith Davidson in relation to this matter? 6 A Keith Davidson is an attorney that was representing 7 Ms. McDougal in this transaction. 8 Q And did you understand from Dylan Howard that 9 Mr. Davidson was doing the negotiating with AMI for 10 Ms. McDougal? 11 A Yes. 13 Q Can you continue reading -- 14 THE COURT: I'm sorry? 15 MR. BLANCHE: I'm sorry. Objection. 16 THE COURT: Overruled. 17 Q Okay.

18 A Same date, Thursday, the 28th of July, 2016. I sent a 19 text to Dylan Howard: "Yes. And thank you." 20 Q Again, if you could read them just as they apply to 21 July 29th? 22 A Sure. 23 He then expresses to me: "They rejected the offer. Told 24 them to come back to me." It says "my," but it's "me by EOD" -- 25 which means end of day -- "with a realistic number."
 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 12 MR. BLANCHE: Objection, Judge.

3321 1 "He agreed to that. He fears she has been convinced to tell 2 her story at ABC. And really wants to. I implored my guy to 3 GET IT DONE." All caps. "He's getting back to me." 4 Q Is that the last text? 5 A No. 6 Q I'm sorry. I apologize. 7 A I then respond back to him: "Okay." 8 To which he then responds to me: "We are having a video 9 conference with her next week to outline the opportunities we 10 will present to -- we will present her to sign up with us." 11 I then ask: "Do you know what day?" 12 And he responds to me: "Monday or Tuesday." 13 And I respond again: "Okay. Thank you." 16 A So several things here. One, I wanted to know what the 17 number was, because I would have to report that to Mr. Trump.

18 When they stated that they are having a video conference 19 with her next week to outline the opportunities, I needed to 20 know what day, again, so that I could update Mr. Trump, and he 21 could have all the necessary information. 22 Q Did you also speak to David Pecker around this time 23 about how things were moving along in the negotiation with Karen 24 McDougal and her lawyers? 25 A Yes.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 14 Q Now, why were you pressing for this information from 15 Dylan Howard?

3322 3 A Yes. 4 Q What was that? 5 A There was the campaign, and we were concerned that this 6 story was going to find its way to ABC, meaning ABC News. 7 Q Now -- 8 MS. HOFFINGER: We can take that down. 9 Thank you.

10 Q -- let me direct your attention now to August 5th -- 11 well, withdrawn. 12 At some point in August now of 2016, so shortly after those 13 texts, did you learn that indeed an Agreement had been finalized 14 between AMI and Karen McDougal? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And how did you learn that? 17 A I was told by David Pecker and Dylan Howard.

18 Q And what was your understanding from them about what 19 the terms of that Agreement were going to be? 20 A The terms were going to be compensation to her in the 22 with 24 penned articles that would bear her name, as well as 23 she was going to be on two covers of one of the various 24 magazines that they owned. 25 Q And did you have a conversation just between yourself Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 Q Was there some particular pressure that you felt at 2 this point that AMI should get this done?

21 amount of $150,000, as well as they were going to provide her 3323 1 and David Pecker about the parameters of this Agreement with 2 Ms. McDougal? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Did Mr. Pecker tell you that he felt that the Agreement 5 was bulletproof? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And what did you understand that to mean? 8 A That they got it. That this is locked down. We 9 prevented the story from being released on ABC News, and 10 effectively the story has now been caught. 11 Q And did you tell -- did you update Mr. Trump on that 13 A Yes, ma'am. 14 Q And did you tell him that you had been told by David 15 that the Agreement was bulletproof? 16 A Yes. 17 Q What was Mr. Trump's reaction to hearing that an 18 Agreement had been signed and done and that it was bulletproof? 19 A Fantastic. Great job. 20 Q Now, did, at some point, Keith Davidson, the attorney 21 for Karen McDougal, reach out to you after the Agreement had 22 been finalized with AMI? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Were you familiar at that time with who Keith Davidson 25 was?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 12 conversation?

3324 1 A Yes.

2 Q And how did you know him at that time? 3 A I had worked with Keith Davidson back in 2011 when 4 there was a story that was out that dealt with Stormy Daniels, 8 Q To take the story down from The Dirty?

10 Q Now, let me have you take a look, please, at People's 11 Exhibit 62 in evidence.

12 (Displayed.) 13 Q By the way, your communications with Keith Davidson 14 were also by phone, also by text?

15 A Yes. It was by phone, email, text.

18 A Yes, ma'am. 19 Q Taking a look at People's 62. Do you recognize that 20 email? 21 A I do.

22 Q And what was this email about? 23 A It's an August 5th, 2016 email sent by Keith Davidson 24 to me and it states: "Michael, please call me at your 25 convenience. Thanks."
 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 16 Q Did you also sometimes communicate with him on an 17 encrypted application?

9 A Yes.

5 and in that story -- it was on a website called TheDirty.com, 6 that Stormy actually wanted to be taken down and we had worked 7 together to effectuate that.

3325 1 Q And was this after AMI had signed the deal with Karen 2 McDougal? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And did you end up having a call with Keith Davidson 5 about the matter? 6 A I did. 7 Q Could you describe, just generally, the substance of 8 the call?

11 Q Actually, do you know what, let me just ask you, when 12 you received this email, did you then call Keith Davidson -- 13 A I did. 14 Q -- as per his request? 16 Q All right. So tell us, if you would just briefly, what 17 the conversation was with Keith Davidson?

18 A Great job. The Boss, I mean, obviously very happy 19 about it. The matter is now resolved. 20 Q Did Keith tell you that he had resolved the matter? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And that was you telling him that The Boss would be 23 very pleased and thank you and good job? 24 A Yes. 25 Q What's your understanding of why Keith Davidson reached Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

10 Thank you. 15 A Yes.

1 out to you after this deal was concluded?

3326 2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Q Now, after AMI finalized the deal with Karen McDougal 5 and paid the $150,000 for the life rights and also for the 6 other that she was going to be doing, did you have any 9 A Yes.

10 Q Tell us a little bit about that? 11 A So David had asked me when he should anticipate 12 receiving or being paid back the 150 thousand dollars. 13 He needed to get the 150 thousand dollars; that he wanted 16 And he had also just laid out 30 thousand dollars 17 previously.

18 So he was putting pressure on me to speak to Mr. Trump and 19 to get the money back.

20 Q Did you have several conversations with Mr. Pecker 21 where he urged you to try to move it along and get him repaid?

22 A Yes. I -- I don't know if I would characterize it as 23 urge as much as he insisted. 24 Q Was he upset about it?

25 A Very.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 7 conversations with Mr. Pecker about Mr. Trump reimbursing AMI 8 for the money that AMI put out?

14 the 150 thousand dollars back because it was too much money for 15 him to hide from the CEO of the parent company.

3327 1 Q So directing your attention now to about September of 2 2016. Did you have lunch with Mr. Pecker where he pressed you 3 further on that matter? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Can you tell us a little bit about that matter? 6 A So he asked me if I would meet him at his favorite 7 Italian restaurant, and I went to meet with him. 8 And, again, he expressed his anger that: I need to get this 9 money back.

10 And I said: Look, Mr. Trump told you that he would pay you 11 back, so he'll pay you back. 12 Q Did you -- after the lunch meeting with Mr. Pecker 16 A I did. 15 Did you inform him of that? 17 Q And what did Mr. Trump say, in substance, about David 18 Pecker's concerns about getting it paid? 19 A Don't worry. I'll take care of it. 20 Q And did you discuss with Mr. Trump David Pecker's 21 request for that money back on one occasion or more than one 22 occasion? 23 A Several occasions. 24 Q Around the same time, did you have any conversations 25 with Mr. Trump regarding other stories that AMI may have had in Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 13 where he was, as you say, upset about not being repaid, did you 14 talk to Mr. Trump about that?

3328 1 the past and some concerns about that?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Can you tell the jury a little bit about that? 4 A So David had expressed to me that, obviously, the 5 relationship with Mr. Trump goes back many, many years and there 6 is a file drawer or a locked drawer, as he described it, where 7 files that relate to Mr. Trump existed. 8 And, at that point in time, David was being considered for 9 the position of CEO at Time, Inc., Time Magazine.

10 And one of the concerns that I had, that I expressed to 11 Mr. Trump, was if he goes, there is a series of papers there 12 that relate to you. 13 Q And what was your concern, specifically, with respect 14 to those stories and Mr. Pecker leaving AMI? 15 A Well, I didn't know what those stories were, and nobody 16 was discussing that with me, but that they would be open for 17 use.

18 Q Meaning that other people might get their hands on 19 them? 20 A Yes. Because we didn't know who the potential CEO or 21 replacement would be. 22 Q And was Mr. Trump concerned about that at that point as 23 well?

24 A Yes.
25 Q Did you discuss with Mr. Pecker those concerns about Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3329 1 whatever other stories might -- AMI might have in that locked 2 drawer? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And what did Mr. Pecker say? 5 A You could technically buy them. We will figure out a 6 way for you to take control over them. 7 Q And around the same time, were you having some 8 discussions with David Pecker about purchasing from AMI those 9 life rights to Karen McDougal's story?

10 A Yes. That was all part of the same transaction. 11 Q So, let me direct your attention now to September 6th 12 of 2016. 13 Did you record a conversation that you had with Mr. Trump 14 about purchasing from AMI the life rights to Karen McDougal's 15 story and these other stories that AMI might have?

16 A Yes.
17 Q Now, during the time, the ten years that you worked for 18 Mr. Trump, how many conversations with him did you tape? 19 A None other. 20 Q So this was the only one? 21 A Yes, ma'am. 22 Q Why did you feel it was important to tape this one 23 conversation? 24 A It was so I could show it to David Pecker, and that way 25 he would hear the conversation so that he would know that we are Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3330 4 Q That he needed to be paid back? 5 A And I also wanted him to remain loyal to Mr. Trump. 6 Q So how did you go about recording this conversation 7 with Mr. Trump? 8 A I had my cell phone in my hand, and I put it on voice 9 memo. All Apple iPhones have it. And I hit record. And I
10 walked in. 11 Q Walked in where? 12 A To Mr. Trump's office. 13 Q And where did you put your phone when you recorded this 15 A It was in my hand. 16 Q Did you sit down to talk to him? Were you standing 22 A On the opposite side of his desk. 23 Q To your knowledge, was Mr. Trump aware that you were 24 recording this conversation? 25 A No, ma'am.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 17 when you had this conversation with him or were you seated, if 18 you can recall? 19 A I don't recall. 20 Q About how far away were you from Mr. Trump when you 21 made this recording using your phone?

1 going to be paying him -- Mr. Trump is going to be paying him 2 back because it was -- it became a regular conversation between 3 the two of us.

14 conversation with Mr. Trump?

3331 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you hand this to the witness, 2 please. 3 Thank you. 4 Q I'm handing you a thumb drive that, among other 5 exhibits, contains People's 246, which is a recording, and 6 People's 248, a transcript.

10 Q Have you previously reviewed that recording, People's 11 246, and the transcript, People's 248, on that thumb drive? 12 A Yes, ma'am. 13 Q How do you know that you reviewed those two exhibits 14 previously? 15 A Because it has my initials on it. 16 Q And you say it has -- would it be the thumb drive? 17 A I'm sorry. The thumb drive has my initials on it.

18 Q Okay. And does it also have the date or just your 19 initials? 20 A It does. 21 Q You don't have to pull out the date, but it has the 22 date and your initials. 25 copy of the original audio recording that you made on your Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 7 (Handed.) 8 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 9 THE COURT OFFICER: You're welcome.

23 Now, People's 246, the recording of that conversation that 24 you taped Mr. Trump on, on September 6th, 2016, is that an exact 3332 1 phone?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And whose voices are on that audio recording? 4 A Several people. 5 Q Who are they? 6 A Mr. Trump. Mine. Rhona Graff. 7 Q When you say "Rhona Graff," was she in and out? 8 A Rhona Graff came in and out, but you hear -- you 9 certainly hear her voice. She's executive assistant, again, to 10 Mr. Trump. 11 Q Now, what generally, before we listen to it, is 12 discussed that's on that taped audio recording? 13 A That I had been working with Allen Weisselberg in terms 14 of -- 15 Q Well, let me stop you a second. 17 Q Just in terms of generalities, when you first walked 18 in, was Mr. Trump on the phone? 19 A Yes. 20 Q Does the audio recording capture some of his 21 conversation on the phone? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And did you discuss partly the purchase of materials 24 from AMI? 25 A Yes.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 16 A I'm sorry.

3333 1 Q Did you also discuss another matter with him before you 2 got to that? 3 A Yes. 4 Q What generally was that? 5 A Charleston. I was referring to a piece of property in 6 Charleston. 7 Q Okay. Was it also generally a discussion of some 9 A Yes.

10 Q -- that you had with Mr. Trump at the time? 11 A Yes, that's another topic that came up. 12 Q Is that audio recording, People's 246, a true and 13 accurate representation of the conversation you had with 14 Mr. Trump on that day, on September 6th of 2016? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Okay. Now, I mentioned a transcript, People's 248, 17 that you also reviewed on that thumb drive.

18 Did you compare that closely with the recording of the 19 conversation? 20 A I did. 21 Q Now, is that transcript just a portion of what's on the 22 recording? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And is it -- does it reflect the portion of the 25 recording related to the purchase of those materials from AMI?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 divorce papers --
3334 1 A Yes, ma'am.

2 Q And is that transcript a true and accurate 3 representation of that portion of the conversation regarding the 4 purchase of materials from AMI? 5 A Yes, there was one change that was made to one word. 6 Q Okay. And is what is currently the transcript that you 7 reviewed -- 9 Q -- that you reviewed carefully against the tape, is it 10 true and accurate in terms of the words that are spoken by both 11 yourself and Mr. Trump? 12 A Yes, ma'am. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: I would like to now play, please, 14 one time through for the jury, People's 246. 15 And if we can play it once in its entirety. Thank 19 Q Now, Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, the first two minutes 20 or so of the conversation were not related to the Karen McDougal 21 matter; is that right? 22 A That's correct. 23 Q That's when Mr. Trump was on the phone and when you 24 were talking to him about some other divorce papers and 25 Charleston; is that right?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 17 (Audiotape played in open court at this time.)
18 **********
8 A Yes.

16 you.

3335 1 A Yes, as well as Pastor Mark Burns.

7 Q And then I will ask you a few questions. 8 (Audiotape being played in open court at this 16 A Well, to open up an LLC, and the LLC would be the 17 beneficial owner of all of the information that was contained in 18 that drawer that David was referencing. 19 Q And all that information, including also the Karen 20 McDougal matter? 21 A As well as the Karen McDougal matter. 22 Q What was the reason for talking about opening up a 23 company? 24 A In order to have separation. Keeping it away from 25 Mr. Trump.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 time.)
10 ********** 11 Q First of all, who is "our friend David?" 12 A It's referring to David Pecker. 13 Q And what did you mean by "I need to open a company 14 regarding the transfer of all that information." 15 What were you talking about?

5 MS. HOFFINGER: So, if we could play now the 6 recording from minute 2 and 4 seconds to 2 and 15 seconds. 2 Q So, I'm now going to ask for us to listen to just some 3 portions. We are going to stop and start it. I'm going to ask 4 you a few questions.

3336 1 Q Now, why was it important to keep it away from 2 Mr. Trump, the purchase of that information? 3 A For privacy purposes and for the benefit of Mr. Trump. 4 Hmmm. 5 Q Now, you didn't refer to Mr. Pecker by his full name; 6 you just said "David." 7 Why didn't you use his full name? 8 And was this sort of typical for this conversation? 9 A It wasn't necessary. Mr. Trump knew who I was 10 referring to. 11 It was an ongoing conversation that we had been having. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we play now the recording from 13 2 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 minutes and 21 seconds. 14 Thank you. 15 (Audiotape being played in open court at this 16 time.) 17 **********
18 Q You mentioned within your conversation with Mr. Trump 19 "Allen Weisselberg?" 20 A Yes. 21 Q Who was he at the time? 22 A Allen Weisselberg was the Chief Financial Officer of 23 the Trump Organization. 24 Q And why did you tell Mr. Trump that you were setting up 25 the LLC and discussing it with Allen Weisselberg?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3337 15 Mr. Weisselberg on financial matters regarding Mr. Trump; is 16 that right? 17 A Correct.

18 Q Now, what did you understand Mr. Trump to mean when he 19 said "what do we have to pay for this? What do we got to pay 20 for this?" 21 A We were referring to the $150,000 that was advanced by 22 AMI in order to purchase the life rights of Karen McDougal. 23 Q So, when Mr. Trump said: "What do we got to pay for 24 this? One fifty?" What was your understanding about the state 25 of Mr. Trump's knowledge at that point about how much money it Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 A Because Mr. Trump had previously directed me to speak 2 with Allen Weisselberg about getting this matter handled. 3 Q And why were you letting Mr. Trump know that you had 4 been in discussion with Mr. Weisselberg about this? 5 A Because we are going to need money, and we are going to 6 need to open up the LLC and to resolve this issue. 7 Q And Mr. Weisselberg's role at the time, you said, 8 was -- 9 A Chief Financial Officer. He handled all of the 10 finances. 11 It was -- every penny that came in or out went through 12 Allen's office. 13 Q And so, this was partly why Mr. Trump directed you to 14 work with him, and this was not unusual for you to work with 3338 1 was going to take to purchase this?

2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Overruled. 4 A He already knew, based upon conversations with David, 5 which is why he mentioned the number "150." 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, can we play the rest of the 7 tape through. Just to the end. 8 Thank you.

13 A "All that stuff" is referencing the information that 14 David Pecker had accumulated over the years of Mr. Trump that 15 was in that alleged locked door -- or drawer. 16 Q And including also the Karen McDougal story? 17 A And including Karen McDougal.

18 Q Now, what was the conversation about "someone may be 19 getting hit by a truck." 20 What was that about it? 21 A As I had said before, Allen Weisselberg was being 22 considered -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. David Pecker was being 23 considered for the CEO position of another -- of Time Inc., and 24 the concern was the information, so "all the stuff" refers to 25 that.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 (Audiotape played in open court at this time.)
10 ******* 11 Q Now, what was the significance of "all that stuff" that 12 was mentioned?

3339 1 Q Now, you mentioned the word "financing," and Mr. Trump 2 asked you about that. 3 Can you explain that? 4 A That was not the best usage of the word, what I really 5 meant was funding, not financing. 6 Q And what did you mean by what you had -- what needed to 7 be funded? 8 A How much money needed to be paid. 9 Q Paid to who?

10 A Paid to David Pecker, AMI. 11 Q Okay. And is that what you understood by, "We will 12 have to pay him something?" 13 A Yes. 14 Q By "we have to pay him something?" 15 A Yes. 16 Q What did you understand Mr. Trump to mean by saying, 17 "Pay with cash?"
18 A Well, to pay in green, which would, obviously, be one 19 way to avoid any type of a paper transaction, but that's not 20 what I thought was the best way to do it. 21 Q And so, is that why you said, "No?" 22 A Correct. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Did you want to take a break, your 24 Honor? 25 THE COURT: It's up to you.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3340

1 Is this a good time?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes. 3 THE COURT: Okay. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 5 THE COURT: All right. 6 Jurors, let's go ahead and take our morning recess. 7 I will see you in about 15 minutes. 8 You may step out.

25 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3341 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 LIEUTENANT: All rise. 3 Part 59 is back in session. 4 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, in the past my practice 5 has always been when there is a tape or something like that 6 produced into evidence, I normally give some sort of 7 limiting instruction along the lines of, Jurors, I just 8 want you to know that the transcript is not evidence. The 9 transcript is just an aid to assist you and it is the tape 10 that is evidence. 11 No one has requested that instruction.

12 Do you want to leave it like that, or would you 13 want me to give it? 14 MR. BLANCHE: We would.

15 MS. HOFFINGER: I believe the transcript is in 16 evidence.

17 THE COURT: It is in evidence as an aid, and I am 18 going to give that instruction. 19 MR. BLANCHE: If your Honor can give it even 20 right now, since we finished that part of the testimony, 21 that would make sense.

22 THE COURT: Sure. 23 Let's bring the witness back, please. 24 LIEUTENANT: Witness entering.

10 (Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom 11 and was properly seated.)
12 THE COURT: You may be seated. 13 THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. 14 All jurors are present and properly seated.

15 THE COURT: Jurors, just one quick instruction 16 before we continue with the testimony.

17 You heard the tape played and you have also seen 18 a transcript. I just want to remind you that the evidence 19 in the case is the tape itself. The transcript has been 20 offered to you merely as an aid to assist you in 21 understanding what is in evidence, and that is the tape.

22 The transcript is also in evidence, but, again, 23 it is the tape itself that is the evidence. 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

25 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
1 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
3343 2 Q Now, Mr. Cohen, when we ended off before the break, I 3 was asking you about Mr. Trump saying something about paying in 4 cash.

5 Why did you think it was a bad idea for Mr. Trump's 6 suggestion that this be paid in cash?

7 A Because we needed to acquire the information, the 13 A It's my voice. 14 Q And what do you recall about why that recording cut 15 off that way with your voice? 16 A Because I received an incoming phone call.

17 Q And what do you understand you were saying in that 18 last piece when you hear your voice? 19 A Hello, are you there?

20 Q Now, why did you -- when you tried to take that call, 21 you said the incoming call you thought was coming in, did the 22 recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump end at that 23 point? 24 A Yes.

25 Q And why did you try to take that call instead of 8 documents, and I believed that the proper way to do it would be 9 by check and make it appear to be a proper transaction.

10 Q Now, at the end of the tape it cuts off, and there is 11 a voice that's heard at the end of the tape before it cuts off.

12 Whose voice is that?

3344 1 continuing to tape the conversation with Mr. Trump?

2 A I must have believed it was an important phone call. 3 Q Was there another reason also that you were 4 comfortable ending the tape?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Tell us about that, please.

22 A Yes. 23 Q And does that record indicate a call at around that 24 time that looks like it came in and perhaps went to voicemail?

25 A It says so, yes.

7 A I didn't want to record more. I already had enough 8 that I would have been able to show David Pecker so as to 9 convince him that he was going to receive the $150,000 back.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, let's put up, please, for 11 Mr. Cohen, what's in evidence, a page from People's Exhibit 12 400. The page that's Bates ending 2726, please. 13 (Displayed.) 14 Q Now, Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review this 15 record, this AT&T record regarding your call history? 16 A Yes.

17 Q And do you recognize it to be an AT&T record of calls 18 to or from your cell phone ending in 0114?

20 Q Does it appear to show an incoming call at around the 21 time that your recording of Mr. Trump cuts off?

19 A Yes.

3345 1 Q And do you recall when you tried to pick up that call, 3 A I don't recall. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down, please.

5 Can we take a look now at a page of what's in 6 evidence as People's Exhibit 263, a page with a Bates 7 ending 69559? 8 (Displayed.) 9 Q Does that appear to be a contact from your phone 10 records, from your phone contacts? 11 A It is.

12 Q Have you had a chance to review that against those 13 AT&T records?

15 Q And does that indicate the number or the person who is 16 attached to the number of that incoming call at around the time 17 that the recording cut off?

18 A It does. 19 Q And who does that number come back to, according to 20 your contacts? 21 A It comes back to Kathy Battle, who is the Branch 22 Manager over at Capital One Bank. 23 Q So, it is your understanding that that was the call 24 that came in --
25 A Yes.

2 do you recall whether it connected or went to voicemail?

14 A I have.

3346 1 Q -- based on the review of these records?

2 A Yes. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 4 Thank you.

5 Q Now, after the audio ended, you ended the audio 9 Q And what was the gist of the conversation that you 10 continued with Mr. Trump after the recording ended?

18 A No, it was not substantial. 19 Q And at that point, as you -- withdrawn.

16 Q And when you say, yes, was it a substantially long 17 conversation? 13 Q So, was there a really substantial conversation after 14 the end of that taped recording?

15 A Yes. 20 You mentioned that the point of this recording was so 21 that you could convince Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump had agreed to 22 repay the money? 23 A To appease him that he was going to receive the money 24 back.

25 Q Was there any reason to have any real further 8 A Yes.

11 A I am going to head over to Allen Weisselberg's office, 12 and I will get back to him with more of an update.

6 recording by trying to pick up this call, did you continue some 7 conversation with Mr. Trump?

3347 1 conversation with Mr. Trump about this at that time?

2 A No. 4 please put up People's 247 also in evidence.

6 Q Now, Mr. Cohen, this is metadata from your phone 7 regarding the taped -- the audio tape of your conversation with 9 I want to ask you a question.

10 After you made that audio recording using your phone, 11 did you ever alter that recording?

12 A No. 13 Q And is that recording exactly the same as the day that 14 you made it on September 6th of 2016?

18 Q Now, I want to go back to your conversation with 19 Mr. Trump on that audio recording where you mentioned having 20 spoken with Allen Weisselberg about setting this whole thing 21 up.

22 Do you remember that? 23 A I do. 24 Q I just want to go back to you -- was it typical for 25 you to discuss financial matters with Allen Weisselberg?

8 Mr. Trump on September 6th of 2016.

15 A Yes. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

17 Thank you.

5 (Displayed.)
3 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, I am going to ask you to 3348 1 A It was typical, too, for everybody to discuss 2 financial matters with Allen Weisselberg. 3 Q And that was why? 4 A Because he was the Chief Financial Officer of the 5 company and was a long serving, loyal employee to Mr. Trump. 6 Q And so, was Mr. Weisselberg, to your knowledge, in 11 Q Yes, sir.

12 A It was also because Mr. Trump would direct me to go 13 speak to Mr. Weisselberg. 14 Q Was that unusual either --
15 A No.

18 A No. 19 Q Did -- to your understanding, did Mr. Weisselberg 20 report directly to Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And I think you said Mr. Weisselberg was a 23 long-standing executive employee there for many years? 24 A Yes, ma'am.

25 Q Where was Mr. Weisselberg's office located in relation 7 charge of the finance and accounting functions at The Trump 8 Organization? 9 A Yes.

10 One additional thing.

16 Q -- to direct you to speak to Mr. Weisselberg about 17 financial transactions?

3349 1 to Mr. Trump's office?

2 A Also on the 26th floor, towards the back. 3 Q Whose office was closer to Mr. Trump's, yours or Mr. 4 Weisselberg's?

5 A Well, initially, it would have been pretty similar, 6 but the second office that I moved into, I was.

7 Q What was your relationship like with Mr. Weisselberg 8 at the time? 9 A It was very good.

10 Q And did you observe how frequently Mr. Weisselberg 11 interacted with Mr. Trump?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And what did you observe? 14 A It was a regular basis.

15 Q And from your experience working at The Trump 16 Organization, would a deal of this magnitude, a $150,000 deal, 17 have been done at The Trump Organization without Allen 18 Weisselberg? 19 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

20 THE COURT: Overruled. 21 A No, not -- it wasn't even a deal of this magnitude.

22 It was any deal would end up going through Allen. Allen 23 handled all the finances coming in and out. 24 Q Can you describe, generally, the conversation you had 25 with Mr. Weisselberg about the McDougal transaction?

3350 1 A So, I went to Allen's office. I expressed to him that 2 we need funding of $150,000 to consummate this transaction. 3 Allen then said to me: Well, if we do it from a Trump 4 entity, that kind of defeats the purpose because the point is 5 not to have the Trump name affiliated to this at all. It's 6 really to create a barrier.

7 And so, he asked me to think about ways that we could 8 raise the $150,000. 9 Q Before we get to that for a moment, in terms of 10 opening up a separate LLC to handle it, did you have a 11 conversation with Mr. Allen Weisselberg about that?

12 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 13 THE COURT: You can answer. 14 A No. I just told him I was going to open up a LLC.

15 Q Was there a discussion about doing that to make it 16 more difficult to track directly to either Mr. Trump or The 17 Trump Organization?

18 A It was in order to keep it separate. 19 Q And, approximately, how many conversations do you 20 think you had with Mr. Weisselberg about the McDougal 21 transaction?

22 A Maybe 10, 12. 23 Q Now, did there come a time that you had some 24 conversations and began working with someone named Daniel 25 Rotstein associated with AMI in terms of effectuating this 3351 1 transfer of the rights from AMI to an LLC?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And who was Daniel Rotstein, to your knowledge? 4 A He is an employee over at AMI.

5 Q And, by the way, you had Mr. Rotstein's contact in 6 your phone as well?

8 Q And did you communicate with him by phone?

21 Q Do you recognize that document on your screen, sir?

22 A I do. 23 Q What do you recognize it to be? 24 A This is a communication from Daniel Rotstein to me by 25 encrypted app Signal.

9 A I did.

10 Q And by email? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Did you also on some occasions communicate with him by 13 encrypted applications? 14 A I believe so.

15 Q And why did you do that with him? 16 A In order to keep the matter secret.

17 MS. HOFFINGER: So, let's show now, please, just 18 to the witness, the Court and counsel, People's Exhibit, 19 209 for identification.

20 (Displayed.)
7 A Yes.

3352 1 Q Are those a variety of communications over a number of 2 days with Mr. Rotstein? 4 Q By encrypted app Signal?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Is this an exact copy of those communications between 7 yourself and Mr. Rotstein using that encrypted app on the dates 8 that are reflected in this record? 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer People's Exhibit 209 in 11 evidence.

12 MR. BLANCHE: No objection. 13 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 14 (Document so received in evidence.)
15 (Displayed.) 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

17 Q Let me direct your attention to the first -- sorry, to 18 September 7th of 2016. There is a text at 8:34 a.m. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you for blowing that up for 20 the jury to see and for Mr. Cohen to see. 21 Q Can you read what's in that communication and explain 22 what it is? 23 A This is just the communication from Daniel Rotstein to 24 me stating, please find possible names, and he listed five 25 different possible corporation names that he was going to use 3 A Yes.

3353 1 as the recipient of the Assignment Agreement.

2 Q And what is the date of that first communication that 3 Mr. Rotstein had with you? 4 What date was that?

5 A September 7th of 2016. 6 Q And was that just one day after you had taped the 9 A Yes, ma'am.

10 Q So, you started working with Mr. Rotstein promptly the 11 next day on that matter?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Just to clarify something, People's 209 are 14 screenshots or photos of the communications you had with Mr.

15 Rotstein? 16 A It was a screenshot sent to me, yes.

17 Q Now, you mentioned an Assignment Agreement.

18 What is the Assignment Agreement that he was 19 referencing there?

20 A What he was referencing was to assign the life rights 21 of Karen McDougal to the LLC entity that was being created.

22 Q So, it would be an assignment from AMI to the company 23 that you set up? 24 A Yes.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, if we can scroll down just a 7 conversation with Mr. Trump about setting up an LLC to purchase 8 the information from AMI?

3354 1 little bit.

3 Q Do you see some additional calls in September 4 following that communication?

18 For good and valuable consideration, the signer does 19 hereby sign and transfer to the assignee, successors and 20 assigns all of his rights, benefits and obligations to the 21 license agreement.

22 Q Just, in general, without reading it for the jury, 23 there is a lot of legal language in there, does it represent 24 the transfer of those rights from AMI to Resolution 25 Consultants?

15 Q Can you just describe for the jury, generally, what 16 were the terms of this Assignment Agreement?

8 between AMI as the signer to Resolution Consultants LLC dated 9 September 30th of 2016, and executed by David Pecker and 3359 1 A Yes. The transfer of the McDougal life rights, as 2 well as the other documents. 3 Q Now, why does this agreement reference $125,000 4 instead of $150,000, which was the payment to Karen McDougal?

5 A So, David had expressed to me that we are going to 6 reduce it from 150 to 125, on the basis that 125 was going to 10 That's what they would have on their books claiming 11 their contract with her was for.

16 A No.

17 Q And who did you understand was, ultimately, going to 18 pay the $125,000 for the life rights to that material? 19 A Mr. Trump.

20 Q Were you planning on owning the life rights to that 21 story?

22 A No, ma'am.
23 Q Why not? 24 A I had no reason to own -- no need to own the life 25 rights. What I was doing, I was doing at the direction and for 12 Q Now, at this time, when you worked out this Assignment 13 Agreement with AMI, between AMI and Resolution Consultants, had 14 you and Allen Weisselberg yet worked out the logistics of where 15 that $125,000 was going to come from?

7 represent the life rights because they were engaged with Karen 8 McDougal for two covers, as well as 24 penned articles; that 9 the compensation to her for that was going to be $25,000.

3360 1 the benefit of Mr. Trump.

2 Q Now, in signing that agreement, around the time that 3 you signed that agreement with AMI, did you have a conversation 4 with Mr. Trump about doing so?

5 A Yes. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up, please -- you can 7 take that down and put up People's Exhibit 349 and 8 reference the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen on 9 September 29th of 2016.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q Do you see a call there, sir, for about seven minutes 12 and fourteen seconds? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And what did you discuss -- what do you think you 15 discussed on the phone with Mr. Trump during that call? 16 A The Karen McDougal matter.

17 Q And did you discuss with him, specifically, whether 18 you were going to be signing this agreement and finalizing the 19 assignment rights?

20 A Yes. I gave him a complete and total update on 21 everything that transpired the day before.

22 Q Why did you speak to him the day before you signed 23 that agreement? 24 A Because it was when I was speaking with David Pecker 25 regarding the transfer and the assignment.

3361 1 Q Did you want to let him know that you were getting it 2 done? 3 A Yes.

6 Q Why did you speak to him the day before you signed it?

8 of, that the matter was going to be resolved, and this 18 A This is a document. It is, as stated, an invoice from 19 Investor Advisory Services Inc., with an invoice number of 20 2016-203, dated September 21st of 2016. 21 Q Did you receive this document at some point?

22 A Yes, I did. 23 Q Who did you receive it from? 24 A I believe Daniel Rotstein.

25 Q What did you understand was the purpose of this 10 resolved. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down now.

12 Can you please put up People's Exhibit 161 in 13 evidence? 14 (Displayed.)
15 Q Do you recognize this document, Mr. Cohen? 16 A I do.

9 conversation, obviously, to let him know that it is being 7 A In order to let him know that it was being taken care 5 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

1 document?

3362 2 A The purpose was to reflect $125,000 that was for the 3 assignment. 4 Q Was it an invoice for the payment of that 125?

5 A Yes, ma'am. 6 Q And let me direct your attention to the description of 7 services.

13 A No, ma'am. 14 Q In truth, what was the $125,000 payment supposed to be 15 for?

17 Q And what's your understanding about why you got an 18 invoice, or why this invoice was from a company called, 19 Investment Advisory Services instead of AMI directly?

20 A I never knew who they were. I still, to this day, 21 don't. It was clearly just to create separation in order to 22 mask the transaction. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 24 Thank you.

25 Q Now, ultimately, you signed this Assignment Agreement 11 Q Was that description a truthful description about this 16 A For the life rights of Karen McDougal.

8 It says, flat fee for advisory services for $125,000. 9 Do you see that?

10 A I do.

12 transaction?

3363 1 and you received this invoice.

2 Ultimately though, did the company, Resolution 3 Consultants, end up purchasing the Karen McDougal materials and 4 the other materials from AMI?

5 A No. 6 Q What happened?

7 A Well, David Pecker contacted me, and stated that it 8 was no longer necessary to have Mr. Trump pay the $125,000. 9 I asked him, why? Satisfied, because now I would 10 report to Mr. Trump that he wouldn't have to pay that amount of 11 money, which would make him happy.

12 And the reason was because the Karen McDougal front 13 cover on Men's Health magazine had sold more copies than they 14 had not only anticipated, I think that they had ever -- the way 15 David expressed it to me, that they had ever sold, and they had 16 made a lot of money on that. And that it was no longer 17 necessary because he didn't need to bury the $125,000.

18 He also then had a second cover to use McDougal on, as 19 well as the 24 additional articles that she was -- that was 20 going to be penned with her name on it. 21 So, he felt that it was, even for the 150,000, it was 22 an excellent business deal. 23 Q Did he tell you what to do with that Assignment of 24 Rights Agreement that you had signed?

25 A He did.

3364 1 Q What did he tell you to do?

2 A He told me to rip it up. Forget it. 3 Q Did you update Mr. Trump after that phone call about 4 what David Pecker had told you about ripping up the agreement?

5 A Yes. 6 Q And what was Mr. Trump's reaction?

7 A It was great. 9 A He doesn't have to pay 125 or $150,000.

10 Q Did you have some understanding of what might happen 11 to the other materials that you discussed with David Pecker in 12 terms of the locked drawer and the other materials that were 13 out there? 14 A Yes. 17 A David was not being considered for Time Magazine so, 18 he was going to stay at AMI and that there was no need to do 19 any transfer.

20 Plus, he also didn't believe that any of the documents 21 that existed in that locked drawer were detrimental to 22 Mr. Trump. 23 Q Now, in total, approximately, how many conversations 24 would you estimate you had with Mr. Trump about the purchase of 25 Karen McDougal's account and story?

8 Q Why did you understand, it was great?

15 Q What was your conversation or understanding about what 16 would happen with those?

3365 1 A Quite a few.

2 Q And were those conversations on the phone, in person 3 or both? 4 A Both.

5 Q And, in total, approximately, how many conversations 6 do you think you had with AMI, with David Pecker and Dylan 7 Howard, about the Karen McDougal deal? 8 A Also a substantial amount. 9 Q By the way, did you ever play for Mr. Pecker the 10 recorded conversation that you had with Mr. Trump where he said 11 he understood that he would have to pay the $150,000?

12 A No. 13 Q Why not? 14 A He didn't ask me to. I had told him that I had spoken 15 to Mr. Trump and that he is going to do it. I told him I 16 could, but I just never played it.

17 Q In other words -- withdrawn.

18 After the conversation you had with Mr. Trump, that 19 you taped on September 6th of 2016, did you move promptly ahead 20 the next day with Daniel Rotstein to finalize the agreements 21 then?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Was there any need to play that recording for 24 Mr. Pecker?

25 A No.

1 Q I would like to direct your attention now to 3366 2 October 7th of 2016. 3 Do you remember where you were on that day? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Where were you?

7 Q How do you remember that you were in London? 8 A Well, I went to London for my daughter's 21st 10 Q And while you were in London, did you become aware of 11 the release of what's known as the Access Hollywood tape?

And the spin that 16 he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk, 17 something that Melania had recommended, or at least he told me 18 that that's what Melania had thought it was. And use that in 19 order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact 20 on him and his campaign. 21 Q And what, if anything, did you do at that point to try 22 to assist the campaign with that effort? 23 A I reached out to members of the media. 24 Q And, in addition -- when you say you reached out to 25 members in the media, did you have conversations with them?

11 Q And do you recall these texts with Mr. Cuomo at the 12 time? 13 A I do. 14 Q Can I direct your attention, I think we have them up, 15 actually. 16 The five texts on October 8, 2016, could you read 17 them, please, for the jury?

18 A Yes, ma'am. 19 On October 8, 2016, I received a text message from 20 Chris Cuomo stating, you going to defend him? 21 I then responded back, I am in London.

22 To which I think I also stated, I have been asked by 23 everyone to do shows starting Tuesday. 24 And Tuesday was when I would be back in New York.

25 I then followed through and said, not sure what I will 8 Q And did you use that number to communicate with him by 9 phone or text?

10 A Yes.

3374 6 contacts?

3375 1 do.

2 And Chris Cuomo's comment back to me, will be too 3 late. He is dying right now. 4 And by, he, he meant -- he was referring to Mr. Trump.

5 Q What was your understanding about what that meant 6 that, he is dying right now?

7 A That this is a tremendously negative story in regard 9 Q And about how long before the election was this at 11 A Approximately, a month.

12 Q And was this one example of some communications you 13 had at the time with members of the press about the Access 14 Hollywood tape?

15 A Yes, ma'am. 16 Q What did you understand as a result of those 17 communications and others about the impact of the Access 18 Hollywood tape on the campaign? 19 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

20 THE COURT: Sustained as to form. 21 Please rephrase.

22 Q Did you have an understanding at the time, based on 23 all of these communications, about the potential impact of the 24 Access Hollywood tape on Mr. Trump's campaign?

25 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

8 to the Trump campaign.

10 that time?

3376 1 THE COURT: Overruled.

2 A Yes. 4 A That this was going to be significantly impactful, 15 A So this is an email from Dylan Howard on October 8, 16 2016, to me with a CC to David Pecker.

17 The subject line is, Link.

18 It says, Evening. The only story was this posted in 19 October of 2006, before AMI owned it, and he is referring to 20 the old Radar Magazine. 21 The tape was not part of the story that existed 22 online. I suggest it would have been lost during the many site 23 changes over the years. 24 Nevertheless, I have deleted the text story. It no 25 longer exists. And he attaches a hyperlink of that story.

8 Can we now put up People's Exhibit 167 in 9 evidence?

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q Do you recognize this email?

12 A I do. 13 Q Can you explain -- first, tell us who the email is 14 with, who it's between and what it is about?

5 especially with women voters. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

7 You can take that down. 3 Q What was your understanding?

3377 7 standards are regarding women. 8 Q So, let me ask you a question.

12 Q Who owned Radar Online? 13 A At the time I didn't know. At the time I made the 14 communication, it was AMI in control of David Pecker.

15 Q And when you found out about this article being up on 16 Radar Online, did you ask David Pecker or Dylan Howard to do 17 something about it?

18 A Yes, ma'am. 19 Q What did you ask them do to?

20 A Immediately take it down. 21 Q Why did you ask them to take it down?

22 A Because it was negative to Mr. Trump. It would impact 23 the campaign. 24 Q Were you concerned about the release of this 25 information, in particular, because of the release of the 1 Q Tell the jury what that's about, if you can flush that 2 out a little bit. 3 A The title of it was Donald Trump, Playboy Man, and it 4 talks about the audio clip, recorded phone conversation between 5 Trump and gossip, Chaunce Hayden, stating that it provides some 6 glimpse into just how exacting the real estate blowhard 9 Did you learn at some point that there was this 10 article called, Donald Trump, Playboy Man on Radar Online? 11 A I did.

3378 1 Access Hollywood tape?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And so, you said Dylan Howard, as referenced here, 4 took the article down, is that right?

5 A That's correct. 6 Q And did you update Mr. Trump to let him know that that 7 article had been taken down? 8 A I did.

12 Q And why did you tell him? 13 A I told him for, again, so he would know that the task, 14 or the situation has been handled, to get credit for it because 15 here I am in London with my family for two important events, my 16 daughter's 21, my anniversary, and I wanted David Pecker to get 17 credit as well.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 19 You can take that down.

20 Q Now, do you recall having several calls in the evening 21 of October 8th with David Pecker and also with Dylan Howard?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Did you have a number of calls with them that night? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Do you recall what was discussed with each of them, in 9 Q Do you believe that you communicated that to him in 10 one of the phone calls you had with him on October 8th of 2016? 11 A Yes.

3379 1 general, that night?

2 A The Access Hollywood tape. 3 Q And was it discussed, also, the Playboy online 4 article?

5 A As well as the Playboy. 6 Q Did there also come a time that night where one of 7 them indicated to you that a woman named Stormy Daniels was out 10 Q Did that come up with Dylan Howard? 11 A I believe it was Dylan Howard.

12 Q Now, did you know, at the time when he advised you 13 about that about who Stormy Daniels was? 14 A I am sorry?

15 Q That's okay.

17 When Dylan Howard told you on the evening of 16 I will say it one more time.

18 October 8th of 2016, that Stormy Daniels was out looking -- 19 well, her manager was out looking to sell her story, did you 21 A I did.

22 Q How did you know who she was? 23 A Because it referenced back to the 2011 scenario that I 24 had dealt previously with David Pecker on -- I am sorry, with 25 Keith Davidson on -- in order to have a story removed from 8 looking to sell her story publicly? 9 A Yes. That conversation came up as well.

20 know who Stormy Daniels was at that time?

3380 1 TheDirty.com.

2 Q And so, hearing now after the Access Hollywood tape 3 release that her story might come out again, what, if anything, 4 did you think about the potential impact that might have on the 5 campaign? 6 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

7 THE COURT: Overruled. 8 A Catastrophic. That this is horrible for the campaign. 9 Q I will take you back for a minute now to 2011, when 10 you first learned about Ms. Daniels' account of her encounter 11 with Mr. Trump.

12 Had you learned at that time in 2011 about what 13 Ms. Daniels' did for a living? 14 A I did.

15 Q What did you hear at that time in 2011 about what she 16 did for work?

17 A That she was an adult film star.

18 Q And this came up, again, I think you mentioned because 19 it was an article on TheDirty.com at the time?

20 A Correct. 21 Q And you worked with Keith Davidson to get that article 22 taken down? 23 A Yes, ma'am. 24 Q In 2011, when you were engaged in doing that, in 25 getting the article taken down, did you have a conversation 3381 1 with Mr. Trump about Stormy Daniels?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Can you tell us, in general, the gist of that 4 conversation?

5 A After I received the information from Dylan Howard, I 6 immediately went to Mr. Trump's office, knocked on the door, 7 said, Boss, I got to speak to you. And I told him about the 8 conversation, the sum and substance of the conversation that I 9 just had with Dylan Howard.

10 And I asked him if he knew who she was. 11 He told me that he did.

12 And I stated about the story that existed on 13 TheDirty.com, that they had a relationship that occurred during 14 a golf outing going back to, like, 2006. And I told him that 15 one of the things that, you know, we need to do is we need to, 16 obviously, take care of it.

17 We need to absolutely do it, take care of it.

18 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan 19 Pearce-Bates was released by Senior Court 20 Reporter Theresa Magniccari.) 21 22 23 24 25 3382 1 (Whereupon, the following proceedings are 2 continued from previous page:) 3 **** 5 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 8 Q. Did Mr. Trump also tell you anything about having met 9 her at the golf tournament back in 2006?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. What did he tell you? 12 A. He told me that he was playing golf with Big Ben 13 Roethlisberger, the football player, and they had met Stormy 14 Daniels and others there. But she liked Mr. Trump; that women 15 prefer Trump even over someone like Big Ben. 16 Q. And did you ask him at that time in 2011 whether he had 17 had a sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels?

18 A. I did. 19 Q. Did he answer you directly? 20 A. No, ma'am. 21 Q. What did he say? Did he say anything in response to 22 that? 23 A. No, ma'am. 24 Q. Did he mention anything about what she looked like? 25 A. He said she was a beautiful woman.

4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 6 Q. Did he also tell you about meeting her? 7 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

3383 1 Q. Let me go back to your conversations with Mr. Davidson 2 about taking that article down from TheDirty.com. 3 Did you also have some conversations with the General 4 Counsel of Life & Style about what he might do if that article 5 wasn't taken down? 6 A. Yes, ma'am.

7 Q. What was the substance of that conversation? 8 A. I would file an immediate lawsuit against him. 9 Q. Ultimately, when you and Keith Davidson were able to 10 get that article down and to make sure -- actually, let me 11 withdraw and go back.

12 The General Counsel you spoke to at Life & Style, were 13 they involved in putting out a different -- another article at 14 around that time, separate from TheDirty.com?

15 A. Yes. 16 Q. And those conversations were about that separate 17 article, meaning In Touch magazine, and making sure that it 18 didn't come out in that magazine? 19 A. Correct.

20 Q. Thank you.

24 let him know that it had been taken care of?

25 A. I did, and gave the credit actually in that case to 21 After you succeeded in making sure that the In Touch 22 article didn't come out, and Keith Davidson was working to take 23 down the article on TheDirty.com, did you update Mr. Trump to 3384 1 Keith Davidson, who was the one who filed and sent papers to 2 TheDirty.com to have it removed. 3 Q. As a result of your efforts and Keith Davidson's 4 efforts, did that article -- either article in 2011, get any 5 traction in 2011, meaning, was it out there much? 6 A. No, ma'am. 7 Q. So, let me now move past 2011. Between that in 2011 8 and 2016, when you found out from Dylan Howard that Stormy 9 Daniels' story had resurfaced again, in between that time, had 10 you heard anything more about the Stormy Daniels matter? 11 A. Nothing. 12 Q. Now, when you learned on October 8th from Dylan Howard 13 that the Stormy Daniels story had resurfaced, did you also learn 14 from Mr. Howard that there was an attorney who would be 15 representing Stormy Daniels in the matter? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. What did he tell you?

18 A. Keith Davidson, he was going to be representing Stormy 19 Daniels. 20 Q. And was that the same lawyer who had represented her in 21 2011 that you worked with? 22 A. Yes. We had, obviously, a positive result. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: So let me ask to, please, put up 24 again 177A, Mr. Cohen's texts with Dylan Howard. 25 (Displayed.)
3385

1 Q. Can you take a look at the texts on October 9, 2016?

2 A. Yes.
5 A. I am sorry? 6 Q. Could you read these to the jury? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Are these all dated on October 9, 2016?

10 Q. If you would read them to the jury. 11 A. This is from Dylan Howard to me, stating: Emailed you. 12 Then he also forwarded a second one, stating: Keith 13 will do it. Let's reconvene tomorrow. 14 Q. Who did you understand "Keith" to be? 15 A. Keith Davidson. 16 Q. Continue, if you would, please. 17 A. Then I responded back to him: Thank you.

18 Followed it then by another text communication advising 19 that Resolution Consultants LLC is the name of the entity that I 20 formed a week ago. 21 To which I then responded again: Whenever you wake, 22 please call my cell. Because of the difference in the time 23 zone. 24 Q. Now, why did you tell Mr. Howard that you had formed 25 Resolution Consultants, an entity, just the week before?

3 Q. Actually, if you are able to, on these texts, could you 4 read them to the jury, please. 9 A. Yes.

1 A. So that would be the name of the entity that we would 2 use in order to purchase the life rights to the Stormy Daniels' 3 matter. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 5 You can take that down. 6 Q. Did you return to New York from London on approximately 7 October 10, 2016? 8 A. I did. 9 Q. And did you have some further text communications with 10 Keith Davidson and Dylan Howard on that date? 11 A. Yes. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up 178A, please. 13 And, specifically, I believe there are two texts. 14 If we can float up a little so Mr. Cohen can read them. 15 (Displayed.) 16 Q. Now, who are these texts between or among? 17 A. So, from Dylan Howard to me, on Monday, October 10th.

18 And it states: Keith/Michael, connecting you both in regards to 19 that business opportunity. Spoke to the client this a.m. and 20 they're confirmed to proceed with the opportunity. Thanks, 21 Dylan. 22 Q. Let me ask you: Is that a three-way text or a two-way 23 text? In other words, yourself and Dylan Howard, is there 24 anybody else on that text? 25 A. Yes, Keith Davidson.

3386 3387 1 Q. So, is it a text from Dylan Howard to both yourself and 2 Keith Davidson? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Okay. 5 Can you also read Dylan Howard's next text 6 communication to both yourself and Keith Davidson? 7 A. So, Dylan Howard sends to both myself and Keith 8 Davidson: Over to you two. Meaning, that the two of us should 9 just speak independent.

10 Q. What did you understand to be the business opportunity 11 that Mr. Howard was referring to? 12 A. The business opportunity was the acquisition of the 13 life rights of Stormy Daniels. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, you can take that down. 15 Thank you. 16 Can we now show People's Exhibit 337, and 17 highlight the call between Mr. Cohen and Keith Davidson on 18 October 10, 2016. 19 (Displayed) 20 Q. I believe there are two calls referenced there. Now, 21 after Dylan Howard confirmed that Keith Davidson would be 22 representing Stormy Daniels, did you reach out and speak with 23 Keith Davidson by phone? 24 A. I did. 25 Q. And from this point on, did you speak a great deal with 3388 1 Mr. Davidson about purchasing the life rights to Stormy Daniels' 2 story? 3 A. Yes. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 5 Thank you. 6 Q. Now, after you learned from Dylan Howard and from Keith 7 Davidson about the Stormy Daniels story, and her wanting to 10 A. I did. 11 Q. Can you tell us -- first of all, why did you speak to 12 Mr. Trump about it? 13 A. Because it was a matter that affected him and because 14 that was what I always did, which was, to keep him abreast of 15 everything. 16 Q. Was this also a serious matter at that time? 17 A. A very serious matter.

18 Q. Did you tell him what you had heard from Dylan Howard 19 and Keith Davidson? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And what was his reaction? 22 A. He was really angry with me: I thought you had this 23 under control. I thought you took care of this. 24 I expressed to Mr. Trump: We did, 2011. I have no 25 control over what she goes out and does.

8 publish that story, and the conversations about purchasing that 9 story, did you speak to Mr. Trump?

3389 1 And he expressed to me: There is previous denial.

2 Just take care of it. 3 There was a lot going on at the campaign at the time. 4 He was like: Just take care of it. 5 Q. Did he say anything to you at that time about how this 6 might be viewed if it got out? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. What did he say, in substance? 9 A. He said to me: This is a disaster, total disaster.

10 Women are going to hate me. Because this is really a disaster, 13 Q. What, if anything, did you understand about -- 14 withdrawn. 15 Why did you understand -- what did you understand him 16 to mean by "women will hate this," and what his concern was? 17 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Overruled. 19 A. So, at the time Mr. Trump was polling very, very low 20 with women and -- 21 Q. You said "very well?" 22 A. No. Very poorly. I am sorry. 23 Q. It's all right. I couldn't hear. 24 A. He was polling very poorly with women, and this, 25 coupled with the previous Access Hollywood tape, he just stated:
11 women will hate me. Guys may think it's cool, but this is going 12 to be a disaster for the campaign.

3390 1 This is a disaster, and get control over it.

2 Q. Did you have any conversation with him about strategy 3 in dealing with the story? 4 A. I am sorry? 5 Q. Did you have any conversation, additional conversation 6 with Mr. Trump about a particular strategy about how to get 7 control of it and how to deal with it? 8 A. He told me to work with David and get control over 9 this, purchase the life rights, we need to stop this from 10 getting out. 11 Q. Was there any conversation about pushing it to a period 12 of time? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. What was that? 15 A. So, during the negotiation to purchase and acquire the 16 life rights, what he had said to me is: What I want you to do 17 is just push it out as long as you can. Just get past the 18 election, because if I win, it has no relevance, I will be 19 President. If I lose, I don't even care. 20 Q. Did you bring up at the time the topic of his wife, 21 Melania, in one of those conversations with Mr. Trump? 22 A. I did. 23 Q. What did you say, in substance, to him? 24 A. I said to him: And how's things going to go with 25 upstairs?

3391

1 Q. Were you concerned about that?

2 A. I was.
3 Q. And what, if anything, did he say to you about that? 4 A. Don't worry, he goes. He goes: How long do you think 6 Q. What did you understand that to mean?

7 A. He wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about 8 the campaign. 9 Q. Now, those conversations that you had with Mr. Trump, 10 were they in person, on the phone, or both? 11 A. Both.

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, can we put up now, please, 13 People's 63 in evidence. Can you blow up the body of the 14 email so that Mr. Cohen can read it.

15 (Displayed) 16 Q. Do you recognize this email, Mr. Cohen?

17 A. This is from Keith Davidson to me on October 11th.

18 Q. What year? 19 A. 2016.

20 And it says: Michael, please find Ms. Daniels' 21 Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement attached.

22 I have not filled in the Side Letter Agreement (SLA) 23 which identifies the parties to this agreement. 24 Under the terms of the Agreement, neither my client or 25 I are entitled to possession of the SLA.

5 I will be on the market for? Not long.

3392 1 Settlement sum is $130,000.

2 I have also attached my firm's wiring instructions for 3 your reference. 4 Ms. Daniels' expressed dissatisfaction with your 5 schedule of the delay of ten days for funding. 6 To that end, you will see that I placed this Friday, 7 October 14 of 2016, as the funding deadline. Let me know if 8 this is a problem. Let me know if you have any questions or 9 concerns about anything.

10 Keith. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Let me ask you to blow up the top 12 of the email which shows the "tos" and "froms." 13 Q. Did you receive this email at your Trump Organization 14 email address? 15 A. I did. 16 Q. Now, this email that you received, which can we scroll 17 down, does this contain an attachment? Does this contain the 18 Settlement Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement that was 19 referenced? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And does this Agreement at this point contain the 22 signatures of Ms. Daniels and Mr. Davidson, but no signatures on 23 your side yet? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. So, the date of this email --
3393 1 MS. HOFFINGER: If we can go back to the email 2 again for a moment. 3 (Displayed.) 4 Q. -- is October 11th; is that right, of 2016? 5 A. Yes. 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. By October 11 of 2016, had you and Keith Davidson 10 already agreed in principal to the terms of this Agreement? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. And you had some discussions about how much would need 13 to be paid to Stormy Daniels for this Agreement by that date; 14 had you arranged a number? 15 A. Yes, ma'am. 16 Q. And tell us, just in general, the terms of that 17 Agreement on this date?

18 A. For the sum of $130,000, that Ms. Daniels would execute 19 a Non-disclosure Agreement, that the life rights story would 20 never come out, that she wouldn't speak of it. And -- 21 Q. Was there a breach provision, an amount, a liquid 22 amount? 23 A. Yes. 24 There was a very large 1-million-dollar per violation 25 liquid punitive damages. It was a clause that we put in where 6 Q. Is that just a few days after the release of the Access 7 Hollywood tape?

3394 3 Q. Whose idea was it to have that million-dollar, as you 4 say, punitive damage provision in the contract? 5 A. It was mine. 6 Q. What was the point of that?

10 Q. There was a list of names that were included in the 11 Agreement? 12 A. Yes, ma'am. 13 Q. Now, the email mentions a Side Letter Agreement. That 14 is also one of the attachments here. 15 What was the purpose of the Side Letter Agreement that 16 is referenced here? 17 A. The Side Letter Agreement would be a one-page document 18 that indicates pseudonym names that we were going to use in the 19 Non-Disclosure Agreement. And the purpose of that is if 20 somehow the Non-Disclosure Agreement got out, having the names 21 Peggy Peterson or David Dennison would have no meaning to 22 anyone. 23 Q. And so, would the Side Letter Agreement be a key to who 24 those names are really related to? 25 A. Yes.

1 she would owe at that point in time the LLC that was going to do 2 it, she would owe them 1-million-dollars per violation. 7 A. To ensure that she didn't speak. Not only that, there 8 was also a provision in there that she disclose who she had told 9 the story to, and they were included in the Agreement.

3395 1 I was the only one that would have that one page.

2 Q. And explain why you were the only one that was going to 3 hold onto that Side Letter Agreement which indicated the true 4 names of the people involved in the Agreement? 5 A. In that way, I was the only one, there is no way for it 6 to be released, and the information would never get out. 7 Q. Now, you said that, I think by this date, neither you, 8 obviously, or Mr. Trump, had signed this agreement by that date? 9 A. No, ma'am.

10 Q. Why hadn't you signed it at that point? 11 A. Because during my conversations with Mr. Trump, it was 12 again about delaying the deal and trying to push it past the 13 election which was upcoming.

22 I would have waited to the tenth day and do it again, 23 which is what I was instructed to do, push it past the election 24 date. 25 Q. So, you could have funded it earlier, but you tried to 17 What was he referring to about your schedule of delay of 18 ten days for funding? 19 A. Well, he wanted an immediate wire transfer, and I 20 expressed to him I would need ten days in order to fund the 21 transaction.

14 Q. Now, in the email, Mr. Davidson says that Ms. Daniels 15 had expressed some dissatisfaction with your schedule delay of 16 ten days for funding.

3396 1 push it off with the additional ten days; is that right?

2 A. I was following directions. 3 Q. So, at this point, he is asking for a funding deadline 4 of October 14th; is that correct? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And were you intending at that point to make that 7 deadline of October 14th? 8 A. No, ma'am. 9 Q. What were you going to try to do?

10 A. Delay it.

22 defendant's guilt or innocence. 23 I will see you at 2 o'clock. 24 Enjoy your lunch. 25 (Jury leaving courtroom.)
11 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, do you want me to 12 continue? 13 THE COURT: Is this is a good time to break? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: It's up to you. It's perfectly 15 fine. 16 THE COURT: Jurors, I will remind you of all of my 17 instructions, including that you not discuss this case 18 either among yourselves or with anyone else. 19 Please continue to keep an open mind as to the 20 defendant's guilt or innocence. 21 Please do not form or express an opinion as to 3397

3398 1 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
2 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 3 Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. 4 A. Good afternoon.

5 Q. When we left off, we were talking a little bit about 6 the funding deadline for the payoff of the Stormy Daniels' NDA.

7 Do you remember that? 8 A. I do.

18 Q. Can you read the emails for the jury, please? 19 A. Yes.

That 25 as a direct result of my failure to wire funds, that Keith 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take that down and put up 9 People's 282 in evidence. If we can blow it up a little 10 bit. 11 (Displayed)

18 It states: I'm told they're going with Daily Mail. Are 19 you aware? 20 Q. What did you understand the "they" were in this email? 21 A. Stormy Daniels. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: And can we blow up the next text 23 communication after this. 24 (Displayed) 25 Q. Can you read for the jury the rest of the text 3410 1 communications on October 17, 2016?

10 The goal is to figure out exactly what was going on and 11 what else could be done. 12 I then respond from me to Dylan: You're kidding. 13 Then I continue by saying: Who are you trying to 14 reach? 15 I wanted just to confirm that my suspicion that he was 16 trying to reach Keith Davidson and not maybe somebody else. 17 To which he responds thereafter: The agent.

18 "The agent" I knew to be Keith Davidson. 19 Q. Now, did you also speak by telephone that day with 20 Dylan Howard? 21 A. Yes, ma'am. 22 Q. And why did you speak with him by telephone? 23 A. This was of grave importance. 24 Q. What, if anything, did you understand at this point 25 about whether Stormy Daniels might end up in the Daily Mail?

3 Then I responded back with three question marks because 4 I hadn't heard back.

3411 1 A. That's what we were told, and that's what I relayed to 2 Mr. Trump. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: And so, let's put up now People's 4 349 in evidence. And let's blow up the call on October 17, 5 2016 at 5 p.m. between Michael Cohen and Mr. Trump. 6 (Displayed) 7 Q. Do you see a call there? 8 A. I do. 9 Q. Who called who?

10 A. I called Mr. Trump. 11 Q. And why did you call him? 12 A. In order to advise him of this situation, that because 13 I didn't forward the funds, she's now declared the Agreement 14 void and that we were not going to be in a position to delay it 15 post the election, which is what he wanted me to do, and that 16 the matter was going to -- the story was going to go to the 17 Daily Mail.

18 Q. Why did you go ahead and do it on that date? 19 A. Because I wanted to make sure that, again, I had a 20 vehicle within which to transfer funds to Keith Davidson to lock 21 down the story. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you very much. 23 Can you take that down. 24 Can we now put up People's 216 for identification. 25 Can you take it down.

Now, I would -- so, we're now talking about October 18, 18 2016, and I would like to ask you: On that day, or that 19 evening, did you make an appearance on Wolf Blitzer's show on 20 CNN that night? 21 A. I did. 22 Q. Why did you do that? 23 A. In order to respond to a series of topics that affected 24 Mr. Trump and the campaign. 25 Q. And did you tell Mr. Trump that you were going on CNN?

9 Q. Was that a workday; do you know?

3416 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And were you going on as a support to the campaign, to 3 try to talk about his priorities? 4 A. Yes, as a surrogate. 5 Q. And you said that was to deflect from some other news 6 that was out there? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And without providing us with any details or 9 elaborating, were you asked by Wolf Blitzer to respond a number 10 of times to questions about reports of Mr. Trump's behavior with 11 women? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And did you steer the conversation as best you could 14 towards his presidential policies? 15 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained. 17 Q. What, if anything, did you do during that interview?

18 A. I advocated for Mr. Trump in the best light possible, 19 denials, as well as exclamations, that I have never seem him act 20 in this sort of manner before. I was doing everything that I 21 could within which to change the direction of the comments. 22 Q. And you had some talking points for the campaign, 23 talking points about Mr. Trump's priorities to deliver on that 24 show? 25 A. I received regular talking points from the campaign.

3417

1 Q. Do you believe you received some that night as well?

2 A. I do.
3 Q. Did you try to emphasize those talking points as well? 4 A. Yes, ma'am. 5 Q. What, if any, additional pressure did you feel to close 6 this deal with Stormy Daniels as a result? 7 A. Well, because the Daily Mail was in play and they were 8 anxious to sell the story. 9 Q. Did there come a time after that, again, still in 10 October of 2016, that Mr. Trump, in substance, expressed to you 11 that he understood he could no longer delay this transaction?

12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And describe that conversation that you had with him? 14 A. He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, 15 some individuals, very smart people, and that: It's $130,000. 16 You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to 17 keep this thing out there. So do it.

18 And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with 19 Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out. 20 Q. Following that conversation with Mr. Trump, did you, in 21 fact, have some discussions with Allen Weisselberg about trying 22 to figure out how the payment would be made? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. And what, in substance, did you discuss with 25 Weisselberg and the different options?

3418 1 A. Well, that I had the opening of the company all set up.

2 Now it just needed to be funded. 3 To which Weisselberg turned and said: Can we get AMI 4 to pay it? 5 I said: No. They've already expressed to me they're 6 not paying it. They said we need to come up with a way how to 7 fund it. 8 I said: We need to do it immediately. 9 Q. What options did Mr. Weisselberg discuss with you?

10 A. One option was to see whether I knew anybody who 11 wanted to purchase a golf membership at one of the various golf 12 courses or possibly somebody who was having a family affair, 13 like a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, that would be interested in 14 paying the money there and taking it as credit off of their 15 invoice, or maybe even just running it through one of the golf 16 courses. 17 Q. Was he suggesting it would be a vehicle to use that 18 money to pay this? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. And what, if anything, did you discuss about those 21 options? 22 A. Obviously, that wasn't a possibility because each of 23 those entities has a Trump name attached to it, and the whole 24 purpose was to ensure that Trump name in no way was disclosed in 25 this Non-Disclosure Agreement.

3419 1 Q. Did you suggest to Mr. Weisselberg about him funding 2 it? 3 A. I did. 4 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. 5 THE COURT: Overruled. 8 You don't have to worry about that one. 9 Q. What did he say?

10 A. He said to me he wasn't financially in a position to do 11 it. He stated: Michael, as you know, I have my four grandkids 14 Q. What did you resolve between the two of you, yourself 15 and Weisselberg, ultimately? 16 A. Well, because of the urgency that was happening and the 17 fact she was heading -- or at least they expressed to me they 18 were heading to the Daily Mail, I ultimately said: Okay, I'll 19 pay it. 20 Q. Was there any discussion at that time with 21 Mr. Weisselberg about you getting paid back eventually? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. What was discussed? 24 A. Don't worry about it, I will make sure you get paid 25 back.

6 A. I stated to Allen: You're the CFO. You're making 7 seven figures. Why don't you pay it. You'll get paid back.

12 at prep school, and that I have summer camps for them that I am 13 paying for, I just can't do it.

3420 1 Q. At some point, did you have a conversation with 2 Mr. Trump about the fact that you were willing to pay for it, at 3 least initially? 9 A. He stated about it: Don't worry about it. You will 10 get the money back. 11 Q. Would you have ever paid for the NDA for Stormy Daniels 12 on your own without an understanding that you would get paid 13 back? 14 A. No. 15 Q. Why not? 16 A. It's $130,000. I was doing everything that I could and 17 more in order to protect my boss, which was something I had done 18 for a long time. But I would not lay out $130,000 for an NDA 19 needed by somebody else. 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we bring up now People's 21 Exhibit 342. Let's show those to the jury. 22 (Displayed) 23 Q. Do you recognize these? What are these, Mr. Cohen? 24 A. These are phone calls made from my cell phone to Allen 25 Weisselberg.

4 A. Yes. Allen and I spoke to Mr. Trump. We expressed to 5 him that I was going to front the money for it. To which he was 6 appreciative and: Good, good. 7 Q. Did you have a sense from Mr. Trump that you would end 8 up being out the money or you would get paid back?

3421 1 Q. Are these calls between July of 2015 to February of 2 2018? 3 A. Yes, ma'am. 4 Q. And did you have Weisselberg's cell phone and work 5 numbers in your contacts as well? 6 A. Yes.

7 Q. Approximately, how many calls are there during this 8 time period with Weisselberg? 9 A. Six, in total.

10 Q. And was it common for you to speak with Weisselberg 11 outside the office; meaning, by phone at other times?

12 A. It wasn't common. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, let take a look at a call. 14 We'll show the call on October 23rd of 2016, at 4:52 p.m.

25 Was there, at this time, October 23rd, a reason that 15 (Displayed)
3422 1 you understood that he was calling and leaving you a voicemail?

2 A. Regarding the funding and regarding how this was going 3 to get done to fund the Non-Disclosure Agreement. 4 Q. And did you -- withdrawn. 5 Did you speak with Mr. Weisselberg over the next couple 6 of days in the office as well? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. About finalizing these details? 9 A. Yes.

That call is at 7:23 p.m. 17 Q. Is that generally after work for yourself and 18 Mr. Weisselberg? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Was it unusual to speak with Weisselberg after hours by 21 cell phone? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Do you have a sense of why you were doing that? 24 A. It had to do with the Stormy Daniels matter. 25 Q. Was there some urgency at this point?

3423 1 A. Significant urgency.

6 Q. Let's take a look at the call between Mr. Schiller and 7 Mr. Cohen on October 24, at 8:02 p.m. 8 Do you see that call? 9 A. Yes, ma'am.

10 Q. And was it 8:02 p.m.? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. You called Mr. Schiller, or did he call you? 13 A. I called Mr. Schiller. 14 Q. Do you know why you were reaching out to Mr. Schiller 15 in the evening of October 24, 2016? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Why?

18 A. Because I needed to speak to Mr. Trump, and I knew that 19 Keith, Keith Schiller was with him. 20 Q. Why did you need to speak with Mr. Trump at that point 21 in the evening of October 24th? 22 A. To discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution 23 of it. 24 Q. And did you have an understanding about whether during 25 that conversation you resolved that, you were moving forward to 2 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 3 Can we take a look at now People's 341 in 4 evidence, please. 5 (Displayed)
3424 1 fund the deal?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. Now, what was the plan for how you were going to fund 4 the Essential Consultants account in order to transfer the money 5 to Keith Davidson? 8 Credit, on my apartment. That account was paperless. Meaning, 9 that we wouldn't receive any documents in the mail.

10 And I elected to use money that was in the HELOC 11 because my wife was the CEO of the household and would not 12 understand if there was $130,000 missing from our joint bank 13 account. She would ask me, and I clearly could not tell her, 14 and that would have been a problem for me. So I elected to use 15 the HELOC. 16 And once I received the money back from Mr. Trump, I 17 would just deposit it and no one would be the wiser.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we now put up People's 177A in 19 evidence.

## 20 (Displayed)

21 MS. HOFFINGER: And cull out the text between 22 Mr. Howard and Mr. Cohen on October 25, 2016. 23 A. So, this is a text message from Dylan Howard to me. 24 And it states: Keith calling you urgently. We have to 25 coordinate something on the matter he's calling you about, or it 6 A. So, I had already, for several months at First Republic 7 Bank, before all of this, I had a HELOC, a Home Equity Line of 3425 1 could look awfully bad for everyone.

2 Q. What did you understand that to mean? 3 A. This matter -- if the matter wasn't resolved, it was 4 going to be catastrophic to Mr. Trump and the campaign. 7 Did you have a call on October 25, 2016 with Dylan 8 Howard and David Pecker? 9 A. Yes, ma'am.

10 Q. Can you describe for the jury that call and what 11 occurred and what was said?

19 Q. And did you make a request at that time of Mr. Pecker 20 on that call? 21 A. Yes.

22 Q. What did you ask him? 23 A. If he would be kind enough to make the payment. 24 Q. Why did you ask him to make the payment at that point?

25 A. To see if he would do it, considering he's been doing 12 A. Well, it was all about, again, the resolution of the 13 Non-Disclosure Agreement. 14 Q. And what, if anything, was Dylan Howard telling you on 15 that phone call? 16 A. How to get this thing done. She's going to the Daily 17 Mail. This could be catastrophic to the campaign. This will 18 further isolate women from the candidate.

5 Q. Did you also have a call on that night, October 25, 6 2016 -- withdrawn.

3426 1 it for Mr. Trump before. I figured why not ask.

2 Q. What did he say? 3 A. Not a chance. 4 Q. Did he say why? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. What did he say? 7 A. I knew he didn't get the money back on the $150,000 8 even though they turned out. I cannot do it again. It can cost 9 me my job.

10 Q. How did you leave things with Dylan Howard and David 11 Pecker on that call, what did you tell them? 12 A. Make sure it's locked down. We're going to take care 13 of it. 14 Q. In other words, who did you say was going to take care 15 of it at that point? 16 A. I was. 17 Q. Thank you.

18 Now, you said earlier, I believe, that you sometimes 19 communicated with David Pecker by Signal, an encrypted 20 application? 21 A. Yes, ma'am. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up just for the witness 23 and counsel and the Judge People's 212 for identification, 24 please. 25 Q. Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

3427 1 A. I do.

2 Q. What is it? 3 A. This is text messages on the encrypted app of Signal. 4 Q. And are these screenshots of the messages and reflected 5 other communications using the Signal Application between 6 yourself and Mr. Pecker? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Aside from what might be some redactions on that 9 document, is this an exact copy of those communications between 10 yourself and Mr. Pecker? 11 A. Yes. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer People's 212 in evidence, 13 your Honor. 14 MR. BLANCHE: No objection. 15 THE COURT: Received into evidence. 16 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 212 was received into 17 evidence.)
18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we focus on the call reflected 19 here on October 25, 2016. 20 (Displayed) 21 Q. Mr. Cohen, do you see a flurry of calls on October 25, 22 2016, between yourself and David Pecker? 23 A. I do. 24 Q. You had called him on that date; is that right? 25 A. That is correct.

3428 1 Q. Is there a reason that it shows so many on this 2 screenshot? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. What was the reason? 5 A. Signal is terrible with keeping phone calls, they drop 6 them all the time. We were constantly calling back and forth. 7 Q. Were there also some calls on October 26th reflected 8 here using the Signal App between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

10 Q. Generally, what were these calls about on October 25th 11 and October 26th with Mr. Pecker? 12 A. The Stormy Daniels matter, the resolution of it. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please show People's 337 in 14 evidence. 15 And can we show the calls occurring between 16 Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson on October 25, 2016. 17 Can we highlight all the calls on that date.

21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Why were there so many calls with Keith Davidson? 23 A. In order to ensure that he knew that the matter was 24 being taken care of, and that soon there was going to be the 25 transfer of funds, in order to have him execute the 18 (Displayed) 19 Q. Mr. Cohen, there are a number of calls back and forth 20 between yourself and Keith Davidson on October 25th?

9 A. Yes, ma'am.

3429 1 Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter.

2 Q. What was your goal in having those communications with 3 Keith Davidson? 4 A. In order to ensure that that occurred, so I could 5 express to Mr. Trump as an update that this matter is under 6 control.

9 your side?

10 A. I might have. 11 Q. Why was that?

12 A. I was hoping that AMI was going to make the payment. 13 Q. But, at the end of the day, you knew they were not; is 14 that correct?

15 A. That is correct. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: You may take that down.

17 Can you now put up People's 342 in evidence.

18 The calls, again, between Mr. Cohen and 19 Weisselberg.

20 (Displayed) 21 Q. Can you cull out the call on October 25, 2016, at 7:23 22 p.m.? 23 A. Yes, ma'am. October 25, 2016, at 7:23 p.m., I made a 24 phone call to Allen Weisselberg.

25 Q. And how long was the phone call, approximately?

7 Q. Did you in any of these conversations mention to Keith 8 Davidson that maybe AMI would still do the payoff instead of on 3430 1 A. Three minutes, 24 seconds.

2 Q. That was in the evening? 3 A. It's in the evening. 4 Q. After hours, after work hours? 5 A. Yes, ma'am. 6 Q. Again, was it unusual for you to call Mr. Weisselberg 7 after work hours? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. Why did you have this call with him?

10 A. In order to discuss the finalization of the funding and 13 MS. HOFFINGER: I will take that down. 14 Q. On the morning of October 26, 2016, did you set up an 15 account for Essential Consultants at First Republic Bank? 16 A. I did. 17 Q. And what did you do?

18 A. I went across the street, which is where it was 19 located, and I told them I need to do a transfer. 20 Q. Now, before you went across the street to set up that 21 account, did you speak to Mr. Trump? 22 A. I did. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at People's 349 24 in evidence, please. 25 Can we highlight the two telephone calls on 11 just some particulars regarding funding for the execution of the 12 Non-Disclosure Agreement.

3431 1 October 26, 2016, one at 8:30 a.m. -- two calls at about 2 the same time, actually, about 8:30 a.m. 3 (Displayed.) 4 Q. You see those two calls? 5 A. Yes, I do. 6 Q. How long was the call for? 7 A. One is 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The second one is for 8 1 minute and 28 seconds. 9 Q. Did you call Mr. Trump before you went and set up the 10 account to make a transfer?

11 A. Yes.
12 Q. What, in substance, did you discuss with him on these 13 two calls? 14 A. I wanted to ensure that, once again, he approved what I 15 was doing because I required approval from him on all of this. 16 That's what the sum and substance of the conversation was, 17 laying out exactly what was going to happen, what was being done 18 in order to ensure the story didn't get sold to Daily Mail or 19 somebody else. 20 Q. Did you let him know you were going across the street 21 and you were going to get the account set up and make the 22 payment? 23 A. Yes, ma'am. 24 Q. Would you have made that payment to Stormy Daniels 25 without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump?

3432 1 A. No.

2 Q. Why not? 3 A. Because everything required Mr. Trump's signoff. On 4 top of that, I wanted the money back. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 8 evidence. 9 (Displayed)
10 Q. Do you see some either emails or text messages here? 11 A. I do. 12 Q. Who are these communications with on October 26th? 13 A. These are communications between myself and Delaney 14 Corp., going back to Patty. 15 Q. Can you take a look at the texts on that date. 16 Actually, withdrawn. 17 You said that you called Mr. Trump at about 8:30 a.m.

18 on October 26th; do you recall that? 19 A. Yes, ma'am. 20 Q. At approximately 9:04 a.m., is that when you reached 21 out to Patty at Delaney Corp. to get documentation needed? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Why did you email her? I believe it's an email at that 24 time? 25 A. Because I needed to get certain documentation in order 7 Now, can you show People's Exhibit 256, please, in 6 Can you take that down.

3433 1 to open up the account at First Republic Bank.

2 Q. What sort of documentation did you need? I think it's 3 in the email. 4 A. Final receipt. 5 Q. For Essential Consultants? 6 A. For Essential Consultants. 7 Q. Did you have an understanding you would need that for 8 the bank to get it set up? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Thank you. 11 Was there some urgency with Patty at Delaney Corp. to 12 get it right away? 13 A. It was time sensitive, so I was doing my best within 14 which to impress upon her that I needed it ASAP. 15 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at now People's 16 368 in evidence. 17 (Displayed)
18 Q. Do you recognize this "Know Your Customer Form?" 19 A. I do. 20 Q. Do you know, when you open up accounts with banks, that 21 they fill out "Know Your Customer" information so they know the 22 need for the account? Are you familiar with that? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. Now, did you meet with a representative of First 25 Republic Bank to give them some further information for the KYC
3434 1 form?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And -- withdrawn. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at Page 2 of 4 7 (Displayed) 8 Q. And if could you read that to the jury, Mr. Cohen? 9 A. Yes, ma'am.

10 It states: Michael Cohen is opening Essential 11 Consultants LLC as a real estate consulting company to collect 12 fees for investment -- it should say consultation work -- he 13 does for real estate deals. It is dated October 26, 2016. 14 Q. And was that business narrative description on the KYC 15 form true or false? 16 A. It's false. 17 Q. Why didn't you give them the true reason of setting up 18 that account? 19 A. To hide the intent of the reason for opening Essential 20 Consultants, which is to pay for a Non-Disclosure Agreement. 21 Q. Did you have an understanding as to whether the bank 22 may or may not open such an account if you had given them a true 23 reason? 24 A. I believe they probably would not. 25 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

Did you have an understanding why Dylan Howard was 15 sending you and Keith Davidson this email? 16 A. Just outlining everything that had happened. They, 17 too, had been very active in terms of helping to secure and lock 18 down the Agreement. Not to mention David wanted to ensure that 19 Mr. Trump knew how much time and work that they had invested 20 into making this happen for his benefit. 21 Q. But, just to focus, this is Dylan Howard on this making 22 sure, is it not, that the transaction -- 23 A. Yes. And Dylan Howard, of course, works for David 24 Pecker. 25 MS.

10 Plaintiff's signature will be Notarized and returned to 11 you via FedEx. 12 Only after you receive the FedEx, will I disburse. 13 Fair? 14 (Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter, was relieved by Laurie Eisenberg, Senior Court Reporter.)
15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 3443 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 Q So -- and I apologize. 3 Was that the second email in this email chain, was there a 4 prior email?

5 A Yes.

8 Q And you can describe the prior email that preceded 9 Mr. Davidson's response. Your email.

10 A Sure.

16 contains the correct name of Essential Consultants LLC. I thank 17 you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing 18 from you later. Yours, Michael." 19 Q Why did you send this email to Keith Davidson?

20 A I sent it to him to ensure that the wire was received 21 by him, that he had properly corrected the name on the 22 paperwork to reflect Essential Consultants LLC, and to ask 23 him -- direct him, as an attorney through his lawyer's IOLA 24 account, not to disburse any funds to Ms. Daniels or anyone 25 else until such time as directed by me.

6 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the prior email.

7 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
11 Prior to the receipt of Keith Davidson's response, I had 12 sent to Keith: "Kindly confirm that the wire received today, 13 October 27, 2016, shall be held by you in your attorney's trust 14 account until such time as directed for release by me, in 15 writing. Additionally, please ensure that all paperwork 3444 1 I wanted to ensure that I received the executed 2 Non-Disclosure Agreement, as promised, before they released 3 funds. 4 Q At this point, you didn't yet have the signed 5 Agreement from Ms. Daniels; correct? 6 A Correct. The signed Agreement and the Side Letter 7 Agreement. 9 You can take that down.

10 Q Now, after you wired that money to Keith Davidson, did 11 you then receive the final Non-Disclosure Agreement and the 12 Side Letter signed by Ms. Daniels? 13 A I did. 14 Q What were the general terms of the Agreement?

15 Were they the same as the Agreement that had been sent to 16 you on October 11th?

17 A Yes.

18 In consideration for the $130,000, that she had transferred 19 all rights assigned to the life rights of the story, and it 20 also contained/states punitive damages of $1 million per 21 violation clause.

22 Q Did you let Mr. Trump know once you received it that 23 you had it? 24 A Immediately.

25 Q Why did you do that?

8 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

3445 1 A For two reasons.

2 One, so that he would know the matter, the task that he 3 gave to me was finished, accomplished and done. 4 But, also, to take credit for myself, so he knew that I had 5 done and finished it. Because this was important.

11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Is this the final Settlement Agreement and Side Letter 13 Agreement signed regarding the Stormy Daniels matter? 14 A This is one page of it, yes.

15 Q We can scroll down just so that you see it is the 18 A (Nods yes.) Yes, ma'am. 19 Q Did Mr. Trump sign this Agreement anywhere?

20 A No. 21 Q Why not?

22 A Because, again, the purpose of it was to ensure his 23 name didn't appear anywhere, as he's a candidate for the 24 Presidency of the United States of America, and this would not 25 have been to his benefit to do so.

7 Actually, let's take a look at -- let's take a look at the 8 Agreement first. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up People's 276, 16 final Agreement.

17 (Whereupon, the exhibit scrolls on the screens.)
10 please.

6 Q Let's take a look at the Agreement first.

3446 1 Q Who signed on his behalf?

2 A I did. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at the first 4 page, please, lower right. 7 A Yes.

19 A I did.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at Page 14 -- 21 actually, Page 15 of the PDF where there's some 22 signatures. 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Blow that up.

25 Q Do you see a signature by Stephanie Clifford?

8 Q What did that stand for? 9 A David Dennison.

10 Q Who did that reference? 11 A That was supposed to be Mr. Trump's pseudonym.

12 Q What are the initials put upon that? 13 A EC. 14 Q What did that stand for?

15 A Essential Consultants. 16 Q Did you put that signature there?

17 A That's my signature, yes.

18 Q Did you do that on each of the pages of the Agreement?

6 Q Do you see some initials for DD? 5 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
1 A I do.

3447 2 Q What's the signature below that? 3 A That's my signature on behalf of Essential Consultants 4 LLC.

5 Q What's the date on it? 6 A October 28th of 2016.

7 Q Now, you'll see that above that, there is a line for 10 A No.

9 Is there a signature there?

11 Q Is that for the reasons you just discussed?

12 A For the same reason. 13 There's also secondary intent here that since it's an LLC, 14 ultimately, what I would do down the road is just transfer the 15 LLC to Mr. Trump, and it didn't require then to have his 16 signature or anything attached; he would still be the 17 beneficial owner of it.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at the Side 19 Letter Agreement, which is on Page 17 of the PDF.

20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 21 Q Just as a reminder, what was the purpose of this Side 22 Letter Agreement? 23 A This was a document, a one of one, that would identify 24 who the pseudonyms referenced.

7 Q Who signed this Agreement, which is Exhibit B of the 8 Agreement?

17 Q You mentioned that you spoke to Mr. Trump about 18 finalizing this Agreement. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at People's 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 A October 28th of 2016, I made a call to Mr. Trump that 25 lasted 5 minutes and 16 seconds at 11:48 in the morning.

20 349 in evidence.

3450 1 Q Was that the same day that you signed the 2 Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement to 3 finalize this deal? 4 A Yes.

5 Q What did you discuss with Mr. Trump on this call? 6 A That this matter is now completely under control and 7 locked down pursuant to the Non-Disclosure Agreement. 8 Q Did you indicate to him that the documentation had all 9 been finalized?

10 A Yes. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

12 Can we now put up People's Exhibit 180 in 13 evidence, please. 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
15 Q I want to direct your attention now to November 4th of 17 Approximately how many days before the election was this?

18 A Several days. 19 Q And did you learn at around this time that The Wall 20 Street Journal was going to release an article with the story 21 about AMI had paid off Karen McDougal?

22 A Yes.

25 A I don't recall who sent me the text. It could have 16 2016.

23 Q How did you first learn, if you can recall, that an 24 article like this was going to be published?

3451 1 been Hope or somebody else.

2 Q But, did you understand ahead of time what the 3 article, generally, was going to be about? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Did you understand ahead of time that in addition to 6 the story being, largely, about Karen McDougal, that there 7 might be a mention of Stormy Daniels as well? 8 A Yes.

12 Q And did you -- before we get to Keith Davidson, did 13 you also contact Hope Hicks? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And did you contact David Pecker? 16 A I did.

17 Q And what was your effort in contacting folks like 18 David Pecker and Hope Hicks at around this time? 19 A So that we can all coalesce around this issue in an 20 attempt to, again, quell the potential effects that would 21 result from an article like this.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take that down just for a 23 moment and bring up People's 338 in evidence. 24 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
25 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we highlight the calls 9 Q What did you do when you found out that The Wall 10 Street Journal was going to be publishing such an article? 11 A Contacted Keith Davidson.

3452 1 between Mr. Cohen and Hope Hicks on November 4, 2016?

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 3 Q Do you see a number of calls that day, Mr. Cohen, that 4 you had with Hope Hicks?

5 A I do. 6 Q What was the substance of your calls with Ms. Hicks 7 that day? 8 A Getting our hands around this article, figuring out 9 how to change the narrative and how to quash any of the 10 negative results that would come from it, as it was days before 11 the election.

12 Q Did you discuss with Hope Hicks what the Trump 13 campaign's response might be to this article? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And what was the gist of the statement that was going 16 to be sent to The Wall Street Journal on behalf of the 17 campaign?

18 A Deny it. 19 Q Did Ms. Hicks tell you before -- withdrawn.

20 Did Hope Hicks share with you a draft statement that she 21 was going to send to The Wall Street Journal?

22 A Yes. 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you take that down and put up 24 People's Exhibit 318 in evidence.

25 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
3453 1 Q Do you recognize that?

2 A I do. 3 Q Tell the jury what that is. What's reflected in that 4 document?

5 A This is an email from Hope Hicks, dated Friday, 6 November 4, 2016, to me.

7 It states: "We have nothing to do with this final attempt 8 by the liberal elite to disparage Donald Trump and stop this 9 historic movement. We have no knowledge of this false story 10 allegedly being shopped around, although it comes as no 11 surprise -- yet another publicity hungry individual with a get 12 rich and famous quick scheme at the expense of Mr. Trump." 13 What she was sending to me was a series of ideas and 14 thoughts to use for the media and to put out to the media.

15 Again, to get control over the release of that article. 16 Q Was she sending you several different options for the 17 campaign to spin as a response to this article?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And was she looking for you to provide some advice to 20 her? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Did you offer your input here on the campaign -- the 23 Trump campaign's response? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Can we scroll up to your email response to her.

1 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
2 A So, after reviewing her four different options, I 3 thought best -- again, it's the same day, 11-4-2016. This is 4 now taking place at 5:40 PM. And I sent this email to Hope 5 Hicks. 6 My comment to her is: "Instead, say: These accusations are 7 completely untrue and just the latest despicable attempt by the 8 liberal media and the Clinton machine to distract the public 9 from the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation into Secretary 10 Clinton and her closest associates." 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

12 You can take that down. 13 Q You mentioned that you also reached out to Keith 14 Davidson?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Tell us about --
17 MS. HOFFINGER: Well, first, can we show People's 18 Exhibit 337. 19 Can we cull out the seven calls Mr. Cohen had 20 with Keith Davidson on that day. 21 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
22 Q Did you have a number of calls with Mr. Davidson on 23 that day? 24 A I did.

25 Q Describe, generally, the calls you had with 3454 3455 1 Mr. Davidson on that day.

2 A I wanted to ensure that Ms. Daniels did not go rogue, 3 that any of the people that she had known weren't providing any 4 statements or information regarding this.

5 Q Let me ask you also a question: Did you also discuss 6 with him Karen McDougal?

7 A Yes. 8 Q Had Mr. Davidson represented Ms. McDougal, as well as 9 Stormy Daniels?

10 A He represented both. 11 Q What, if any, discussion did you have with him -- that 12 article we looked at was, largely, about Karen McDougal? 17 A That she was also under control, that nobody is going 18 rogue here. 19 Q In addition to that, did you express any anger at 20 Mr. Davidson for that article? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Why? 23 A Because she was his client, and I expected that he 24 would have this under control.

25 Again, it was days before. And I wanted to ensure Mr. Trump 13 A It was mostly, 95 percent of it, 99 percent of it was 14 Karen McDougal.

15 Q What, if anything, did you discuss with Mr. Davidson 16 on those phone calls about Karen McDougal?

3456 1 was safe.

2 Q Were you angry with him? 3 A Very. 4 Q Did you think someone on his side had leaked something 5 like this to The Wall Street Journal? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Did you indicate to him that somebody might be very 8 upset with him?

18 guys did where -- this is -- this is a major problem. 19 Q Did Mr. Davidson issue some comments and denials to 20 The Wall Street Journal in response? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Were you satisfied at that point? 23 A That was the way he was going to appease me. More 24 importantly, to appease Mr. Trump.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

10 Q Who did you indicate might be very upset with him? 11 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. Leading.

12 A Mr. Trump. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 Q What, if anything, did you tell him about Mr. Trump 15 during those calls? 16 A That he was really angry, and I truly hoped that we 17 don't come back to find out that this is something that you 9 A I did.

3457 1 You can take that down.

2 Q Did you also speak with Dylan Howard on November 4th 3 of 2016 about The Wall Street Journal article? 4 A Yes.

6 evidence.

18 A Well, remember that AMI was now in contract with Karen 19 McDougal for the two covers as well as the, um, 24 articles 20 that were to be penned. 21 And I was expressing to him also, in a rather angry manner, 22 that: She's now part of your team. You need to get a hold of 23 this and also start issuing denials. 24 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

25 Can you also put up 340 in evidence.

5 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show People's 339 in 7 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we cull out four calls with 9 Mr. Howard on November 4th of 2016.

10 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 11 A Yes.

12 Q Did you have a number of calls with him, as well? 13 A Yes. 14 Q What, generally, did you discuss with him?

15 A The Karen McDougal article. 16 Q Was there a concern -- what, if any, concern did 17 you -- on the part of AMI was there about this article?

3458 1 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
2 Q Did you also have a number of calls with David Pecker 3 on November 4th of 2016? 4 A Yes.

5 Q What, generally, did you discuss with him? 6 A Same -- same matter and the same statements that I had 7 made to Dylan Howard.

20 My response immediately was: "Of course." 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

22 You can take that down. 23 Can we put up People's 341 in evidence now. 24 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
25 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we highlight the calls 12 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we pull up, in particular, 14 some texts on November 4th of 2016 between Michael Cohen 15 and Keith Schiller. 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
17 A So, on November 4th of 2016, at 7:26 PM, I received a 18 text message from Keith Schiller, asking me if I can take a 19 call in 30 minutes.

8 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 9 You can take that down.

10 Now, can we show People's 262 in evidence, 11 please.

3459 5 A This reflects my conversation with Mr. Trump, who was 6 with Keith Schiller at the time.

7 Q And this is -- the call here is at approximately 8 9:06 PM? 9 A Yes.

10 Q For about five minutes? 11 A Five minutes, 55 seconds.

12 Q Almost six minutes. 13 And do you believe you spoke to Mr. Trump using 14 Mr. Schiller's phone at that time?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Do you recall the substance of your conversation with 17 Mr. Trump, just generally?

18 A Yes. 19 Q What was it?

20 A This was a real serious, again, problem. Especially 21 being that it was so close to the -- Election Day.

22 And I told him exactly who I had spoken to, the sum and 23 substance of my conversations with each of them: David said he, 24 as well, was going to get to the bottom of all of this. I had 25 Dylan Howard on board. I even had Keith Davidson. That we 1 between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Schiller on 11-4 -- November 4th 2 of '16. 3 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 4 Q What does this call summary reflect?

3460 1 were going to be issuing denials and do everything within our 2 power to protect Mr. Trump. 3 Q Was he angry, upset on that call? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Did he stress why he was upset? 6 A Because there was a negative story that, once again, 7 could impact the campaign as a result of women. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 9 You can take that down.

10 Q Now, after The Wall Street Journal article came out 11 with this story about Karen McDougal, largely, did you have 12 some texts with Hope Hicks right after the article came out? 13 A Yes. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you put up, please, People's 15 259 in evidence. 16 Your Honor, is there a time you want to take a 17 break?

18 THE COURT: This a good time? 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Perfectly fine.

20 THE COURT: Let's take our afternoon recess. 21 You can step out.

22 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 23 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 24 are excused.)
25 THE COURT: You can step out.

3461 1 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
2 THE COURT: I am not going to rush you. 3 I want to get a sense of how much you have. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: I believe I'll be going into some 5 portion of tomorrow. 6 THE COURT: Thank you.

7 (Whereupon, a recess is taken.) 8 **************************************** 9 COURT OFFICER: Part 59 is back in session.

10 THE COURT: You can get Mr. Cohen. 11 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

12 (Whereupon, the witness, Michael Dean Cohen, 13 having been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes 14 the witness stand.)
15 THE COURT: Let's get the jury. 16 COURT OFFICER: Jury entering.

17 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 18 are present and properly seated.) 19 THE CLERK: Case on trial continued.

20 All jurors are present and properly seated. 21 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
22 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 23 Q Mr. Cohen, when we left off, we were talking about the 24 day The Wall Street Journal article came out about Karen 25 McDougal and whether you had some texts with Hope Hicks on that 3462 1 day.

2 Do you remember that? 3 A I do. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's 259 now, 8 A I do.

17 Q My apologies.

18 Correct. November 5th. 19 That's the day after the article came out?

20 A Yes, ma'am. 21 Q Can you read the texts with Hope Hicks on that day?

22 A It's from me to Hope Hicks at 7:35 AM: "So far I see 23 only six stories. Getting little to no traction." 24 Hope then responds to me: "Same."
25 Then she continues with: "Keep praying. It's working."
7 Q Do you recognize these texts, Mr. Cohen?

6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 5 please, in evidence.

9 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's direct Mr. Cohen's attention 10 to cells 10, 11 and 12 on the record. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Texts dated November 4th of 2016. 13 Can you read those texts? 14 MR. STEINGLASS: November 5th. Those are 15 November 5th. 16 A November 5th.

3463 1 Q What did you mean when you said, "So far I see only 2 six stories. It's getting little to no traction?" 3 A The concern was, again, that this story would explode 4 into a massive issue, and we were monitoring to see the type of 5 traction that the story was getting from other news sources. 6 So far, she only found six stories. I found six stories.

7 And we were, again, hoping, praying that it was working, 8 that what we did in terms of the denials and reaching out to 9 the various media outlets was suppressing the story itself.

17 talking about it. No one believes it and if necessary, I have a 18 statement by Storm" -- Stormy -- "denying everything and 19 contradicting the other porn star's statement. I wouldn't use 20 it now or even discuss with him as no one is talking about this 21 or cares."
22 Her response to me: "Agree." 23 Q What did you mean here by a reference to "a statement 24 by Stormy?"
25 A As per the earlier statements that I made when I had 10 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look now at cell 13 11 and 14 on Page 2.

12 This is another text on November 5th of 2016. 13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 14 Q Can you read that?

15 A Yes. 16 Again, November 5, 2016. From me to Hope. "Even CNN not 3464 1 reached out to David Pecker, Dylan Howard, Keith Davidson, the 2 goal was to be able to obtain statements from them and use them 5 Q Where you indicated that if you needed to, you could 6 get a statement from Stormy Daniels if you needed to?

7 A Correct. 8 Q Now, can you please take a look at cell --
11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Can you read those texts, please? 13 A This is November 5th of 2016 from Hope to me: "David 14 Pecker's cell?"
15 And she responds again: "I have it but he thinks it's 16 wrong."
17 I then sent her David's cell number, contact information.

18 She says: "That's the same one. Thanks." 19 I then send a response: "He called me from this number 20 this morning." 21 Hope responds to me: "The spoke. All good."
22 I think she meant: They spoke. All good. 23 Q What did you understand her to mean by "Spoke. All 24 good?"
25 A Mr. Trump.

9 MS. HOFFINGER: Pull up cell 17 and 22 on Page 2 10 at 11:24 AM.

3 and issue denials to the sum and substance of the conver -- of 4 the article.

1 Q Spoke with who?

3465 2 A I believe with David Pecker. 3 Q Four days later, or at that point a few days later, on 4 November 4th -- withdrawn.

5 On November 8th of 2016, a few days later, did Mr. Trump 6 win the election?

12 Q Why not? 13 A Because my service was no longer necessary, as I was 14 Special Counsel to Mr. Trump, and he was now President-Elect.

15 Q So, with Mr. Trump leaving, would there be anybody for 16 you to work with or report to at The Trump Organization?

17 A No, ma'am.

18 Q Was that because you previously reported directly to 19 him?

20 A And only to him. 21 Q After Mr. Trump was President-Elect, were there some 22 discussions about potential roles for you in the White House? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Were you offered a position as Assistant General 25 Counsel?

10 Trump Organization? 11 A No.

8 Q Now, after Mr. Trump was elected President in November 9 of 2016, was there going to be a continuing role for you at The 7 A Yes.

3466 1 A Yes. It was something that Reince Priebus had offered 2 to me. 3 Q Did you want that role of Assistant General Counsel? 4 A No, ma'am.

5 Q Did Mr. Trump or anybody working for him on the 6 transition team ever offer you the position of Chief of Staff?

7 A No, ma'am. 8 Q Was that disappointing for you, that you were not 9 offered or your name was not considered for that role?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Explain.

12 What was the disappointment? 13 A Well, I didn't want the role. I didn't believe the 14 role was right for me or that I was even competent to be Chief 15 of Staff. 16 I just wanted my name to have been included in the fact 17 that I had not once, but twice, started the campaign, been a 18 surrogate. After all of this going through, I had other ideas 19 for myself, what I wanted, but I wanted to at least be 20 considered. 21 It was more about my ego than anything.

22 Q Did some of your friends or your colleagues suggest to 23 you that you should have been considered for that role? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Did you indulge some of that conversation?

3467 1 A I did. I indulged them.

2 Q For the reasons you explained, that you would have 3 liked -- 4 A I would have liked to have been considered. It would 5 have been right. 6 Again, it was solely for my ego.

7 Q Now, at some point during this transitional time 8 period, so from November to December, did you pitch to 9 Mr. Trump another role for you after he became President?

10 A Yes. 11 Q What was the role that you -- or the title role that 12 you pitched to him? 13 A Personal Attorney to the President.

18 And every President has a personal attorney. 19 So, my thought was: That way I can continue to protect 20 him, to do the things that he needed with these other matters 21 and it would be protected.

22 I also had another thought in mind, which was consulting. 23 And that's what I really wanted. Because it also afforded me 24 the opportunity to stay at home with -- or stay in New York 25 with my son, my daughter, my wife.

14 Q And what were the reasons that you wanted that title, 15 that role, Personal Attorney to the President? 16 A First of all, I thought that he would need it because 17 there was still outstanding matters that we were dealing with.

3468 1 None of them wanted to go to D.C.

2 Q Was -- when you say it would afford you an opportunity 3 to do consulting, did you have an idea of how you might use 4 this title of Personal Attorney to the President to your 5 benefit? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Explain that to the jury. 8 A Sure. 9 As Personal Attorney to the President, it opens up a 10 tremendous amount of doors for people who are trying to 11 understand Mr. Trump.

12 Unlike a Hillary Clinton or any other President or 13 politician, they're known. They have a history. 14 Mr. Trump was an enigma. He was a businessman, and nobody 15 knew what his feelings were, what his positions were on a 16 multitude of different areas.

17 Because of my close proximity to him for a decade, I did 18 understand it. 19 And I started to receive, early on -- literally, when I
20 was -- like, literally, the day after the election, people 21 would say: Hey, this is a great idea. There are people who are 22 going to want to speak to you because they need to formulate 23 their next four years of his Presidency to benefit their 24 business.

25 Q Did you think that, in a way, that you could monetize 3469 1 your being Personal Attorney to the President?

2 A Absolutely. 3 Q In what way monetize? 4 A You know, with consulting agreements to various 5 different companies who wanted to understand Mr. Trump and 6 understand what his positions and his feelings are on certain 7 topics or issues. 8 Q Did that become your plan about what to do going 9 forward?

10 A Yes. 11 Q In December of 2016, did you make, sort of, a formal 12 pitch to Mr. Trump about your having that position, Personal 13 Attorney to the President? 14 A I did.

15 Q Can you explain that a bit? 16 A Yes.

17 So, on several occasions, Mr. Trump would say: "So, what 18 role is Michael taking?" 19 Reince Preibus would say: "I'm not sure yet. I've been here 20 ten minutes. You've been here ten years." 21 Then we go back to my office, and I say to Reince, "It's 22 all good. It's all good. It's not what I wanted." 23 So, I again pitched to Mr. Trump my interest in being 24 Personal Attorney to the President.

25 In order to assist me, I actually brought in an attorney 3470 1 who is incredibly knowledgeable in history and presidential 2 history, and he prepared a memorandum. This was like a 3 three-page memo. 4 And we sat with the President-Elect at the time for about 5 an hour, and he went through this pitch, explaining the 6 importance and necessity of having a personal attorney for his 7 own protection and why I fit exactly that role. 8 Q Now, in connection with that pitch that you made to 9 President-Elect Trump at that time, in that meeting, did you 10 discuss anything with him about potential compensation for that 11 title?

12 A No, ma'am. 13 Q Why didn't you? 14 A Because I didn't expect to be compensated.

15 I knew that the compensation was going to come from the 16 companies that were already interested in speaking to me.

17 Q Now, did you mention to some other folks at The Trump 18 Organization that you had asked Mr. Trump for that title of 19 Personal Attorney to the President?

20 A Yes, ma'am. 21 Q Was one of the people that you mentioned that to Allen 22 Weisselberg? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Did you have discussions with your family about you 25 wanting that title, Personal Attorney or Counsel to the 3471 1 President?

2 A Yes. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: I'd like to show just to the 4 witness, please, and Counsel and the Court, People's 5 Exhibit 258 for identification. 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of 8 Q Do you recognize this document? 9 A I do.

10 Q What is it? 11 A These are text communications between myself and my 12 daughter. 13 Q And what, generally, do they relate to? 14 A To the position and the fact that I was not being 15 considered for Chief of Staff. 16 Q And are these texts exact copies of text 17 communications you had with your daughter on those issues at 18 the time reflected in this document? 19 A Yes, ma'am.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer in evidence People's 21 Exhibit 258.

22 MR. BLANCHE: No objection. 23 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 24 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 258 is received in 25 evidence and is shown on the screens.)
7 the witness and the parties.)
3472 1 Q There are quite a few texts on there.

2 Can you summarize to the jury what's comprised in this 3 text? 4 A Sure.

5 So, my daughter and I are very close. We're very much 6 connected.

7 And she was concerned that I was upset that I was not being 8 considered for the role. 9 I explained that Reince Priebus was pushing like a madman 10 early on. But I explained to her that there are so many 11 opportunities.

12 "Like what?" 13 I said: "When they come closer, I'll tell you all of them." 14 At the time, when I was communicating with my daughter, she 15 was at college at the University of Pennsylvania. And I didn't 16 want to get into the ideas that were going on because they were 17 still in a formulation state.

18 And so, she asks me: "Are the opportunities in government 19 or no?"
20 And I explained to her: "It's a hybrid." 21 And what I was referring to as "a hybrid" is meaning as 24 to monetize my relationship and my ability with these various 25 different companies.

22 Personal Attorney to the President, I would continue to have my 23 continued access to President Trump, and I would still be able 3473 1 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 2 relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the 3 transcript continues on the following page.) 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1 *******

3 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
4 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
5 Q Did there come a time, ultimately, that Mr. Trump then 6 gave you that title, Personal Counsel to the President? 7 A Yes, ma'am.

8 Q Do you remember -- do you know approximately when that 9 occurred?

10 A It was in January, like a day or two before he left for 11 the Inauguration. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. Thank you 13 so much.

14 Q I want to direct your attention to December of 2016, 15 when you were still at The Trump Organization.

16 Before President-Elect Trump gave you the title of Personal 17 Attorney to the President, was it customary in that time period, 18 December of 20 -- December of every year, actually, for 19 employees to receive an end-of-year bonus?

20 A It was for me. 21 Q So, December of 2016, did you find out -- well, 22 withdrawn.

23 How did you generally find out what your bonus was in 24 December of each year? 25 A So, after Mr. Trump would leave, he would be on a plane Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3475 1 or he had already arrived to Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, Rhona would 2 walk around with a Christmas card, and it would be signed by 3 Mr. Trump and others, wishing you a Happy New Year, Merry 4 Christmas, et cetera, and in it would be a check. 5 Q And was it -- 6 A And that's how you would find out what your bonus is. 7 Q So now, in December of 2016, just before you left The 8 Trump Organization, how did you find out what your bonus was? 9 A Rhona came and delivered the envelope, the Christmas 10 card. 11 Q And that year, December of 2016, was Mr. Trump in the 12 office when you received that bonus check in a card? 13 A No. 14 Q Do you know where he was at the time? 15 A He was in flight or had already arrived. 16 Q You mean in Florida? 17 A In Florida.

18 Q When you opened up the card and saw the check, how did 19 you feel about your 2016 bonus? 20 A Angry. Beyond angry. 21 Q Why were you angry? 22 A He cut my bonus by two-thirds. 23 Q And had Mr. Trump, at that time, in December of 2016, 24 repaid you yet for the $130,000 that you paid out for Stormy 25 Daniels?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 A No.

3476 2 Q And so, how did you feel about the situation of him 3 cutting your bonus and then also not repaying you yet for the 4 Stormy Daniels payout? 7 It made no sense.

10 $130,000 on his behalf to protect him, it was insulting that 11 the gratitude shown back to me was to cut the bonus by 12 two-thirds. 13 Q Did you express your anger about the situation to 14 Mr. Weisselberg?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Would you tell the jury about your conversation with 17 Mr. Weisselberg about that?

18 A So, right after opening it, I actually had to take a 19 double take and then immediately went to Mr. Weisselberg's 20 office in the back and in some very colorful language expressed 21 to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes 22 no sense. At all. 23 But I used quite a few expletives. 24 Q Now, did you mention in that conversation with 25 Mr. Weisselberg that he also hadn't repaid you for the 130,000?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 5 A I was truly insulted, personally hurt by it. I didn't 6 understand it.

8 After all that I had gone through in terms of the campaign, 9 as well as things at The Trump Organization, in laying out 3477 1 A Yes. I mentioned the fact that: You didn't lay out 2 the money; I did. 3 You weren't prepared to lay it out; I did. 4 And the best that you get for showing loyalty, the best that 7 I didn't expect more, but I certainly didn't expect less.

10 A Yes. Every year Allen had the list, and he would sit 11 down with Mr. Trump and they would go through it before the 12 checks were prepared. 13 Q And so, was part of your anger also at Mr. Weisselberg 14 for allowing your bonus to be cut?

15 A Yes.
18 A Take it easy. You know that Mr. Trump loves you. We 19 are going to do right by you. We will make sure that -- we are 20 going to make sure that you are taken care of. Just go. Enjoy 21 your vacation. Relax. We are going to do -- we will make this 22 right. 23 Q And did he tell you when it would be made right? 24 A After the holiday, when everybody returned to the 25 office.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 Q Did Mr. Weisselberg generally know what executives like 9 yourself were getting as bonuses end year?

16 Q What was Mr. Weisselberg's response to you at that time 17 to the anger that you expressed to him?

5 you get for extending yourself as I did is have your bonus cut 6 by two-thirds.

3478 5 A I think it did, in light of all of the things that I 6 had just been involved with and helped to resolve. I was, even 7 for myself, unusually angry. (Laughter.) 8 Q Did you complain to a few other people also about your 9 anger about not being repaid and also having your bonus cut?

10 A I'm sure I did. 11 Q Do you know whether you expressed your upset with David 12 Pecker? 13 A I'm sure I did. 14 Q Do you recall specifically any conversation with David 15 Pecker about your end-of-year bonus? 16 A Yes. 17 Q Can you just tell the jury a little bit about that, 18 what you recall? 19 A Yeah. I engaged him in conversation: Could you 20 believe this? I mean, it's like after all of this, and laying 21 out $130,000 to protect him, this is the best that I get? 22 And I couldn't believe it. 23 I was really -- I -- and it was, it wasn't even so much 24 about the number as much as it was about the, sort of, 25 disrespect that came with it.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 Q What was your understanding about whether your 2 impact -- withdrawn. 3 What was your understanding about whether your anger had any 4 impact on Mr. Weisselberg?

1 And I was just -- just personally insulted.

3479 2 Q Did you ask Mr. Pecker to help you with it? 3 A I -- I don't recall. 4 Q Did you also complain to Keith Davidson about it at 5 some point? 6 Do you remember having a phone call with him?

7 A I might have had a phone call with Keith Davidson. 8 Q Also complaining about the situation? 9 A I may have mentioned it.

10 I'm not so sure that -- Keith Davidson and I didn't really 11 know each other, other than his representation of Ms. Clifford 12 and Ms. Daniels, whereas David Pecker I had a much longer 13 relationship with. So, I'm not sure that I was complaining to 14 Keith Davidson as much as I probably just mentioned it.

15 Q Now, did you go away with your family on holiday? 16 A I did.

17 Q And did Mr. Trump call you while you were on vacation?

18 A He did. 19 Q Can you tell the jury a bit about that conversation?

20 A He called me just before New Years, just to say: 21 Hello. How are things going? Are you enjoying the vacation?

22 Next year, you should come to Mar-a-Lago. Don't worry about 23 that other thing. I'm going to take care of it when we get 24 back.

25 Q What did you understand him to mean by that?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3480 1 A What he meant was the two-third diminution in the 2 bonus.. 3 Q Did he mention at all -- what, if anything, did he 4 mention about any conversation that he had with Allen 5 Weisselberg? 6 A That he spoke to Allen and that he knows that I was 7 angry, but it's going to -- we will take care of it when we all 8 get back.

11 meeting with Mr. Weisselberg concerning the repayment of the 12 $130,000 that you had gave to Stormy Daniels?

13 A Yes.
14 Q Tell us how that came about? 15 A Well, it's now after the new year, and I had laid out 16 this money with the understanding that it was going to be paid 17 back to me, how I was going to be reimbursed for this, and there 18 was no conversation about it. 19 So, I, of course, brought it up to Mr. Weisselberg to ask: 20 "When am I getting the money back?" 21 Q And what, if anything, did he say about trying to 22 resolve that with you? 23 A So he said to me: "Let's sit down. Let's meet and 24 let's do it." 25 Q What, if anything, did he ask of you to provide to Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 Q Now, after you had returned to the office, after your 10 holiday, did there come a time in January of 2017 when you had a 3481 1 him?

2 A So he asked for me to bring him a copy of the statement 3 showing the $130,000 transfer. 4 Q And -- 5 A From First Republic Bank. 6 Q And did he say anything to you at all about-- in 7 connection with that meeting or in that conversation, about 8 settling things globally and the position that you wanted? 9 A Yes, because we were -- not only was it about the 10 position, but also about other matters that were still open and 11 outstanding, for example, the bonus, as well as an issue with a 12 company called Red Finch. 13 Q Did you provide him with a document showing the 14 transfer of the $130,000 to Keith Davidson for Stormy Daniels? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And did you say it was a bank statement from First 17 Republic Bank?

18 A Yes. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's Exhibit 35, 20 please, in evidence. 21 (Displayed.) 22 ********** 23 Q Do you recognize this document? 24 A I do. 25 Q What is it?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3482 1 A This is the bank statement for Essential Consultants 2 for the period of October 26th of 2016 through the 31st of 3 October of 2016. 4 Q What does it show? 5 A This is the document that I gave to Allen. 6 Q What does it show, this document? 7 A It shows the deposit of $131,000, and the withdrawal of 8 $130,035. 9 Q Does it show where the payment went to?

10 A It does. 11 Q What does it show? 12 A It shows domestic wire funds debit to Keith M. Davidson 14 Q And this is a document that you gave to Mr. Weisselberg 15 without the handwriting initially? 16 A Correct. 17 Q So let's look at the handwriting now. Whose 18 handwriting is at the bottom right? 19 A That's my handwriting. 20 Q And whose handwriting is at the bottom left and middle? 21 A That's Allen Weisselberg's. 22 Q And how were you able to recognize Allen Weisselberg's 23 handwriting? 24 A Well, I recognize the handwriting, but I was also there 25 in the room when he was writing it.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 13 Associates PLC.

3483 1 Q Over the years you've seen his handwriting and you've 2 watched him write on this document? 3 A Yes, ma'am. 4 Q Now, tell us what Allen Weisselberg told you at the 5 meeting, including what he told you to write on that document? 6 A So for Tech Services that were done. And it's 7 regarding a different type of a matter, one that I had gone to 8 Mr. Trump with on a regular basis in order to -- it was to 9 purchase IP addresses and things like that. The total that was 10 due to Red Finch was $50,000. But that was actually done, like, 11 two years earlier. 12 Q So did Mr. -- what, if anything, did Mr. Weisselberg 13 tell you about what to put down about those monies that were 14 owed to Red Finch from two years earlier? 15 A Include everything as -- obviously, I was no longer 16 going to have a position at The Trump Organization, there was no 17 way for me to get that money back or to have this matter done --
18 Q What, if anything, did he tell you to do in terms of 19 totaling the monies owed to Red Finch and the monies that you 20 had paid out to Stormy Daniels to Keith Davidson? 21 A So the 130,000 was obviously the money that went for 22 the Non-Disclosure Agreement. 23 He told me to add up the 130 with the 50,000 for Red Finch. 24 Total it to 180,000. Thirty-five was lost, that was just a wire 25 transfer fee.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3484 1 Then he told me what he was going to do was to, it's called 2 "Gross it up," because I was taking it -- because I was taking 3 it as income. 4 And in order to get back the 180, you need to actually 5 double it because of tax purposes, being I was in the 50 percent 6 tax bracket, City, State and Federal. 7 So, in order to get back the 180, what he did was, he then 8 wrote down 360,000.

11 A Yes. 12 Q And what was your understanding about why he said he 13 needed to gross it up to 360,000? 14 A Because otherwise you wouldn't get back your 180. It 15 would be, obviously, less. 16 If they gave me the 180, and they didn't gross it up, after 17 taxes onto it, it would be 90. Then, that's, again, assuming 18 that you take it as income as opposed to just a wash. 19 Q Let me back up just for a second. 20 Were you previously -- you were familiar with paying 21 expenses for something, in other words, The Trump Organization, 22 did you ever pay out any expenses for a business trip or 23 something like that? 24 A Yes. 25 Q And when you submitted it to The Trump Organization, if Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 9 Q Did he tell you that he wanted to gross up that number 10 of 180,000 to 360,000?

3485 1 you laid out $100 as an expense, what did you get back?

2 A One hundred dollars. 3 Q So it was not grossed up, the reimbursements were not 4 grossed up generally from the Trump Organization, to your 5 knowledge? 6 A Correct.

7 Q And was it Allen Weisselberg's idea that it should be 9 A And that it should be taken as income.

10 Q And so, was it his suggestion that you take it as 11 income instead of a reimbursement?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Now, you mentioned Red Finch. The payment plus the 14 $50,000 to Red Finch.

15 And I think you mentioned that it was some services that a 16 tech company had provided to Mr. Trump?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And you said it was a couple of years earlier? 19 A Yes, it was earlier.

20 Q And had they completed the work for Mr. Trump? 21 A They did.

22 Q And had you discussed with Mr. Trump the work that was 23 done and completed and that he owed Red Finch $50,000? 24 A Yes, ma'am.

25 Q And did he decide to pay Red Finch the money that they Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 8 grossed up to $360,000?

3486 1 were owed?

2 A No. 3 Q And, briefly, without describing details, why did he 5 A Because he didn't feel that he had gotten the benefit 6 of what he wanted, which dealt with the ranking. 7 Q Now, did you end up paying out some money yourself to 8 Red Finch?

9 A I did.
10 Q How did that come about? 11 A So I happened to know the CEO of Red Finch, and he 12 explained to me that: This isn't fair, I'm out money, I had to 13 acquire -- lay out money for the IP addresses that we were 14 obtaining and requesting. And each time that I needed to go back 15 for more, I would go to Mr. Trump's office asking and requesting 16 that he give me the permission. 17 And so, I said to him, let me -- I said, I'll -- I'll take 18 care of it -- I'll take care of you. 19 I needed him for other things that I was working on for 20 Mr. Trump's benefit. 21 And so I went to my bank and I took out money to give him 22 because he told me he was going to be coming into New York from 23 Virginia. 24 Q And did you pay him the full $50,000? That was the 25 bill?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 4 tell you that he didn't want to pay them?

3487 1 A No, ma'am.

2 Q And given that you didn't pay him the whole $50,000, 3 why did you put down $50,000 on there? 4 A Well, for the previous year and a half I had told 5 Allen: Look, I laid it out. My hope was to get it, the money 6 from Allen onto it, so that I can give it to him. 7 But it never happened, but I constantly reminded him because 8 I did want him, you know, to receive the funds. 9 Q Did you pay Red Finch less than $50,000?

10 A I did. 11 Q Okay. And why did you then ask for $50,000 back? 12 A Because that's what was owed and I didn't feel 13 Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the difference. 14 Q And if you were going to get $50,000, but you paid out 15 less than 50,000, were you going to keep the rest of it for 16 yourself? 17 A That's what I ended up doing.

18 Q And just to go back to one thing. 19 Did Allen Weisselberg -- was Allen Weisselberg able to 20 approve the repayment to Red Finch for $50,000 without 21 Mr. Trump's approval? 22 A No. 23 Q Now, was there another piece to this repayment to you? 24 I think where we left off, you said that Mr. Weisselberg said 25 you needed to gross up the 180,000 to 360,000 to make it look Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3488 1 like income; is that right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q Was there something else that you were going to be 4 repaid? 5 A Yes. 6 Q What else? 7 A The -- in addition to the bonus that he had already 8 been previously given to me of $60,0000. 9 Q And what did he tell you about that $60,000 additional 10 bonus? 11 A That this is the best that he's going to get and... 12 Q Did he say anything about trying to make it right 13 because your bonus had been cut? 14 A Yes. Though, it was still short of what I expected, 15 but he thought that this was going to be an amount that would

16 make it right.
17 Q So, in addition to grossing up the 180 to 360, added on 18 to that was another $60,000 for some additional bonus?

19 A Correct.
20 Q And what was the total that he wrote -- so is that, 21 those calculations on the left side by Mr. Weisselberg?

22 A They are.
23 Q And that's his handwriting?

24 A It is.
25 Q So what -- can you just tell the jury about the Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3489 1 additions and the calculations there that Mr. Weisselberg 2 wrote? 3 A So you take 360 and add 60 to it, it was 420,000. 4 Q And what, if anything, did he indicate about the 5 420,000 at that point, if anything? 6 A Well, he didn't at that point. It was only after we 7 had spoken to Mr. Trump about the $420,000 which, obviously, I 8 realized that they had already spoken. 9 Q Before you get to that. Just one question. I
10 apologize. 11 I just want to go back to something on the issue of Allen 12 Weisselberg telling you that they were going to gross up the 180 13 that you had put out or stated that you had put out as an 14 expense, of grossing it up to $360,000, so that it would appear 15 to be income. 16 What was your understanding about Mr. Weisselberg's 17 background in terms of accounting and taxes?

18 A He's not a CPA. He has been Mr. Trump's CFO for well 19 over four decades. 20 Q And as Chief Financial Officer, what is your 21 understanding about whether he oversaw the Accounting Department 22 at The Trump Organization? 23 A He oversaw every aspect of the Accounting Department. 24 Q And, to your knowledge, did he also work with outside 25 tax accountants?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3490 1 A He did.

2 Q And based on that, and your knowledge of working with 3 him over the years, what's your understanding about his 4 knowledge about taxes and accounting? 5 A He certainly knows more than I do. 6 Q What, if any, understanding do you have about why he 7 grossed that reimbursement up to $360,000? 8 A I didn't know. And, to be honest, I didn't really even 9 think about it. I just wanted to get my money back.

10 Q Now, at the end of the conversation that you just had 11 with Allen Weisselberg, did you believe that you were or think 12 that you were going to get that $420,000 back in one lump sum? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Okay. And following the meeting with Mr. Weisselberg 15 and both of you adding that handwriting to People's 35, what did 16 you do and where did the two of you go at that time? 17 A We went to Mr. Trump's office in order to speak to him 18 about this. 19 Q Now, when was this, approximately? 20 A Right before the -- Mr. Trump left for the 21 Inauguration. 22 Q So, was he still at Trump Tower at that time? 23 A Yes. 24 Q What did you understand he was engaged in at Trump 25 Tower at that time?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3491 1 A Being President-Elect.

2 Q Was he at meetings at Trump Tower?

3 A Yes.
4 Q Now, what happened when you went into Mr. Trump's 5 office to have this discussion with him? 6 A During the conversation, Allen turned around and said 7 to me, ummm, while we were talking about this, it was -- and 8 what we're going to do is, we're going to pay you over 9 12 months.

10 It was probably better if I get it in one lump sum. 11 No, no, no, no. Why don't you do it as over 12 months and 12 it will be, ummm, paid out to you monthly. 13 Q And did he say anything about how it would be paid out 15 A Yeah, as like a legal service rendered since I was then 16 being given the title as Personal Attorney to the President. 17 Q And we will get to that in a second.

18 So was this conversation that you had with Mr. Weisselberg 19 in Mr. Trump's office with Mr. Trump? 20 A Yes. 21 Q And did Mr. Weisselberg have with him this document, 22 People's 35? 23 A He did. 24 Q And did he show this document to Mr. Trump? 25 A Yes.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 14 as something?

3492 9 A Yes.

24 A Yes.

25 Q Now, you mentioned something before, but I just wanted Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 Q And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump how 2 much you were going to be paid in total? 3 A It was going to be divided by 12, and it's $35,000 a 4 month, and that they would actually start making the payments 5 in February, not January, because there was a lot going on with 6 Mr. Trump moving to D.C., the Inauguration, and so on.

7 Q And did Mr. Weisselberg reflect those payments over 8 12 months on that bank statement, People's 35?

10 Q And can you just read what that says there in the 11 middle or the bottom?

12 A It says 420,000 divided by 12, that's an equal sign. 13 And that's 35,000. And that's per month. 14 Q And so was it stated -- did Mr. Weisselberg state in 15 front of Mr. Trump that you were going to receive $420,000 over 16 the course of 12 months?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at that time? 19 A He approved it. And he also said: "This is going to 20 be one heck of a ride in D.C." 21 Q And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump that 22 those monthly payments would be, you know, like a retainer for 23 legal services?

3493 1 to question you about it.

2 Did you say something to the effect of that you had the 3 sense that they had spoken about this previously? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Why do you say that? 6 A Because they always played that sort of game of frick 7 and frack type game. 8 And I didn't -- I had been around that office more than 9 enough to realize that this conversation had already taken place 10 between the two. 11 And when I asked for the 420; Mr. Trump said, no, it's 12 better, it's better to do it over the 12 months. 13 Q And -- 14 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, objection to that answer 15 and move to strike. 17 Q And when Allen Weisselberg laid out the plan of how 18 much you were going to get paid and over what months and showed 19 Mr. Trump this document, did Mr. Trump try to renegotiate? 20 A No. 21 Q So he approved it at that point? 22 A Yes. 23 Q Now, at some point did Mr. Trump confirm to you that he 24 was going to give you the title of Personal Attorney or Personal 25 Counsel to the President?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 16 THE COURT: Overruled. Overruled.

3494 1 A Yes.

2 Q When in relation to this meeting was that? 3 A Around the same exact time. 4 Q Okay. And was it -- did you have a conversation just 5 between yourself and Mr. Trump about that role during that time? 6 A I mean, we've had conversations. 7 Q Was it -- did Mr. Trump indicate to you that he was 8 giving you the title? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Was it in this meeting or shortly after this meeting? 11 A Yes. 12 Q One or the other? 13 A It was one or the other. 14 Q And was it -- was the $420,000 that you were going to 15 receive back from Mr. Trump going to be payment for future legal 16 services as personal counsel? 17 A That was what it was designed to be.

18 Q Well, what was it actually? 19 A Reimbursement of my money. 20 Q It was. It was a repayment of which monies? 21 A It was a repayment of the Stormy Daniels payment as 22 well as, again, you had had the bonus and then the Red Finch 23 money. 24 Q Now, you said that you believed that this occurred at 25 Trump Tower some days before Mr. Trump actually left for Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3495 1 Washington; is that right?

2 A Correct. 5 grossed up reimbursements? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And also in connection with that, you would be given 8 Personal Counsel to President Trump? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And, as a result of that, did you look at some of your 11 phone records as well? 12 A That's correct. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: So let's pull up, please, People's 14 Exhibit 250 in evidence, please. 15 (Displayed.) 16 MS. HOFFINGER: I'm sorry, okay. Can you make that 17 a little bit bigger.

18 Thank you. 19 (Displayed.) 20 Q What is this text, Mr. Cohen? 21 Who is it with? 22 A This is a text message on January 17th from me to a 23 gentleman named Gene Freidman, who was the manager or the 24 operator of my yellow cab medallions in New York City. 25 And I wrote to him, "Thank you. I leave tomorrow for D.C.

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3 Q And do you have a sense of-- based on some of your 4 phone records about when this meeting occurred, about the 3496 6 And in connection with you, were you also at that meeting 7 shortly thereafter being given the title Personal Counsel to 8 Mr. Trump? 9 A Yes.

10 Q I want to just go back to one question that I neglected 11 to ask you. 12 That document that we looked at, People's Exhibit 35, 13 which contained the calculations that Allen Weisselberg did to 14 get you from 180 to 360 and adding the bonus, and so on, did Mr.

17 A No.
18 Q What, if anything, did you know that he did with that 19 document; if you know? 20 A I believe -- I don't know. I believe he put it in a 21 file. 22 Q And so, is your sense that -- based on this document, 23 and perhaps another one, did you have a sense of the approximate 24 timing of the meeting that you had with Allen Weisselberg and 25 Donald Trump about the reimbursement?

 Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3 Q And does that help you date the time of this meeting 4 that you had with Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump when you 5 talked about the $420,000?

1 And just between us, I will be Personal Counsel to President 2 Trump."
15 Weisselberg ever give you a copy of that document after all the 16 handwriting had been put on it?

3497 1 A Yes.

2 Q What's your approximation of when it was? 3 A January 17th. 6 A It could have been the day before. And the reason I
11 A Correct. 12 Q Did you also go on the Sean Hannity show the next day, 13 on January 18th, and announce that you were going to be Personal 14 Counsel to the President? 15 A I did. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we just pull up People's 17 Exhibit 251 in evidence as well, please.

19 Q Do you recognize that? 20 A I do. 21 Q And can you tell us what those texts meant -- that text 22 message is about? 23 A This is a text message from a gentleman named Steve 24 Denari to me, stating that he just seen me on Hannity and saw 25 the announcement: "Congratulations on being President Trump's Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 7 say that is because I spoke to Gene Freidman on a very regular 8 basis. 9 Q And you told him on the 17th that you were going to be 10 Personal Counsel?

4 Q And could it have been the day before? Do you know for 5 sure, based on this, whether it was the 16th or the 17th?

18 (Displayed.)
3498 1 Personal Counsel." His word: "Consigliere." "Look forward to 2 speaking with you further after the Inauguration." 3 Q And does that also date for you that you made that 4 announcement on the Hannity show on January 18th? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Now, did Allen Weisselberg ask you to -- or did he tell 7 you or discuss with you when you would be repaid those monthly 8 payments for the reimbursement of the $420,000? 9 A Yes.

10 Q What did he say? 11 A That it would start in February, because with the Trust 12 and with the movement going on of Mr. Trump going to D.C., it's 13 going to just take a little bit of time to get things -- to get 14 things moving, so just be patient. 15 Q Did he indicate something that you should do in terms 16 of submitting something to get paid at some point? 17 A Yes. But he --
18 Q Go ahead. 19 A What he stated to me is each month, you know, just 20 send an invoice to us and just mark down for legal services 21 rendered pursuant to the Agreement and we will get you a check 22 out. 23 Q Now, after Mr. Trump, President-Elect Trump gave you 24 the title of Personal Attorney to the President, before you 25 left, did you have a conversation with him about whether you Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 3499 3 A No. 4 Q Did you -- did it come up at all, whether, you know, if 5 you did some work, whether you would be paid for it? 6 A I mean, when he said to me, yeah, you know, whatever 7 you end up doing, you know, just take it easy on any bills, he 8 goes. But I knew what he was referring to. He had given me 9 this title, his Personal Attorney, and I was proud to accept 10 that title, which I wanted, so I knew that there would be no 11 compensation for any of the other work. 12 Q And so, did you have any expectation that if you did 13 work for him you would be paid? 14 A None at all. 15 Q And, from your perspective, how were you essentially 16 getting paid for that title? 17 A By monetizing the role as Personal Attorney and 18 creating consulting agreement relationships. 19 Q Now, are you aware that when attorneys represent a 20 client and receive compensation for work, that they are required 21 to put together either a Retainer Agreement or a written 22 Engagement Letter? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And did you ever put together any sort of a Retainer 25 Agreement for any future work that you might do for Mr. Trump as Lisa Kramsky, Senior Court Reporter 1 would be compensated for any legal work that you might do for 2 him in the future in that role?

3500 1 Personal Attorney?

2 A No, ma'am. 3 Q Why not? 4 A Because I knew there was going to be no compensation. 5 Q And did the $420,000 that you received have anything to 6 do with being a payment for future work that you might do for 7 Mr. Trump as Personal Attorney to the President? 8 A No. 9 MS.
