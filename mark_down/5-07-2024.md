 Senior Court Reporters 2507 1 THE CLERK: This is the People of the State of 2 New York against Donald J. Trump, Indictment 71543 of 2023. 3 Appearances. 4 Starting with the People, please. 5 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 6 Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Matthew 7 Colangelo, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis. 8 MS. NECHELES: Good morning, your Honor. Susan 9 Necheles.

10 I am here with President Trump, Todd Blanche, Emil 11 Bove and Gedalia Stern. 12 Good morning. 13 THE COURT: Good morning, Mr. Trump. 14 Anything that we need to discuss? 15 MR. STEINGLASS: I don't think so, Judge. 16 THE COURT: All right.

20 will be Stormy Daniels -- and we want to renew our objection 21 to her testifying, in particular, to her testifying about 22 any details of any sexual acts. 25 And to the extent that it has any relevance, it's 17 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, just one thing.

18 We want to renew our objection this morning to -- 19 we are informed that the witness today, the second witness, 23 We think that this is irrelevant. It has nothing 24 to do with the charges in this case.

2508 1 unduly prejudicial.

2 And there really is no reason for it to be coming 3 into the case about books and records here. 4 THE COURT: And when you say "details of any sexual 5 act," what do you mean? 6 Do you mean more than just "we had sex"? 7 MS. NECHELES: Yes, your Honor. 8 THE COURT: Okay. 9 I will hear from the People.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, this has been fully 11 briefed by the Defense, and your Honor has ruled in your 12 Court decision on March 18th of 2024, at Page 304. 13 And you placed some limits on testimony regarding 14 Karen McDougal and incidents in June, but no limits on the 15 testimony of Stormy Daniels, obviously, recognizing that her 20 important. 21 The defense has opened already on her credibility 22 and reasons for why she did what she did. 23 They have cited money that she has made on other 24 things. 25 And it's important for us to establish her 16 testimony and the narrative completes the story of, you 17 know, the events that precipitated the payoff shortly before 18 the election. 19 The details of the encounter, your Honor, are 2509 11 THE COURT: So when you say that some details 12 are necessary, can you give me a sense of what you have in 13 mind? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes. 15 I mean, the details will be how she ended up having 16 a sexual encounter with him. 17 Obviously, there will be -- we will elicit the 18 conversation that occurred in the hotel room, at the 19 defendant's hotel room. 21 important. 20 I think the full conversation is very, very 1 credibility here. So, therefore, the details are important.

2 We have been careful, your Honor, to omit certain 3 details that might be too salacious. 4 We can, at some point, if you would like, list the 5 things that we are omitting, although I don't think that 6 it's necessary for me to do that in open court. 7 But the general details of what occurred, including 8 the sex act, barring certain details that are unnecessary, 9 are a significant part of the story, but also very important 10 for us in terms of her credibility.

24 basic. 25 It's not going to involve any descriptions of 22 How she even ended up having a sexual act with him, 23 and then in terms of the sexual act, it will be just very 2510 1 genitalia or anything of that nature.

2 But -- but it's important for us to elicit how she 3 came to have sex with him and how she felt about it at the 4 time. 5 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I understand that you 6 ruled before already, but we are in a different place now. 7 You have seen the evidence in this case, and you 8 have seen where it is. 9 And there is just no need for those kind of details 10 here. 11 You know, there is a real question about the 12 credibility of this woman. 13 And she signed letters saying she didn't do this, 14 and obviously that's an area for cross, but I don't think 15 it's needed in this case. 16 You know, this case is a case about books and 17 records and we shouldn't be getting into how she felt about 18 it. 19 What happened in the room, really -- 20 THE COURT: Well, I don't know that Ms. Hoffinger 21 said that. 22 I'm satisfied with the representations that 23 Ms. Hoffinger has made. 24 She has indicated that they don't need to go into 25 any details about the sexual act itself.

2511 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Well, your Honor, there will be 2 some details about the sexual act, very brief, very brief. 3 We have to elicit that they did have intercourse, your 4 Honor. 5 THE COURT: Well, that's fine. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 7 THE COURT: But we don't need to know the details 8 of the intercourse. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: That's correct.

10 I agree with you that she has got credibility 11 issues, right, and, therefore, I think that makes it all the 12 more important for the People to establish her credibility 13 by eliciting certain background information about the events 14 that led to that encounter. 15 So I will allow that, based on the representations 16 that the People have made. 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

18 THE COURT: All right. People, please call your 19 next witness. 22 the third time. 23 THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. Jury entering. 24 (Jury enters.) 25 THE COURT: You may all be seated. 20 MS.

18 "When Spy Magazine started years ago, they decided to do a 19 'Who is the Cheapest Millionaire?' Test. They sent checks in 20 the amounts from fifty cents to five dollars to a list of 21 millionaires throughout the country. I received a check for 22 fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. 23 They may call that cheap; I call it watching the bottom 24 line." 25 "Every dollar counts in business, and for that matter, every 2528 1 dime. Penny pinching? You bet. I'm all for it."
2 "As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where 3 my money's going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read 4 my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged." 5 Can you.....thank you. 6 "There is human (and now computer) error everywhere -- at 7 restaurants, at the phone company, at the grocery store, at 8 hotels -- and you'd be surprised by how much this human error 9 can cost you."
10 "Don't be obsessive about it, but check through your bills 11 from time to time." 12 "You should also always feel comfortable bargaining for 13 goods and services." 14 "I do it all the time, and I'm one of the richest men on 15 earth." 16 "Even in high-end shops, I bargain. After all, the more 17 you're paying for something, the more the seller should be able 18 to shave off the price." 19 "I hate paying retail, and it makes me cringe when I see 20 other people doing it. I've walked into stores and offered 21 $2,000 dollars for a $10,000 dollar item." 22 "It can be embarrassing for me (especially since everyone 23 knows that I'm Trump and that I'm wealthy), but you'd be amazed 24 at the discounts you can get if you simply ask." 25 "You do have to be willing to walk away, but after you've 2529 1 walked away a few times, the price will come down."
2 "I understand that penny-pinching can have a negative 3 connotation --as in 'miserly'-- but when you calculate how much 4 ten cents on a price can matter if you multiply it by a hundred 5 thousand or a million, the value of ten cents becomes clear." 6 "For instance, let's say I have to buy one hundred thousand 7 light bulbs for all of the buildings that I own and maintain 8 each year. If I manage to save ten cents on each light bulb, 9 that's a savings of ten thousand dollars per year!"
10 "That's ten thousand dollars I can put toward another 11 building or another investment or donate to a cause that needs 12 the money more than I do." 13 "Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances such as 14 percentages and cents. Numbers that seem trivial add up and 15 have enormous implications." 16 "My parents hammered frugality into me at an early age, and 17 it's the most important money-management skill a person can 18 use. Call it penny-pinching if you want to; I call it financial 19 smarts." 20 Q Thank you. 23 (Displayed.) 24 Q Miss Franklin, is this another chapter of "Trump: How 25 To Be A Billionaire?" 21 MS. MANGOLD: Can you pull up for the jury what's 22 in evidence as People's 414C.

2530 1 A Yes. Pages 66 and 67.

2 Q What is the chapter title? 3 A "How to Decide How Much Risk to Assume" -- I'm sorry, 4 "How to Decide How Much Risk to Assume When Investing." 5 Q Can you please read for the jury the unredacted portion 6 of this chapter. 7 A "You need to watch the bottom line. Allen Weisselberg, 8 my Chief Financial Officer, has to be one of the toughest people 9 in business when it comes to money."
10 "When I was having some financial problems in the early 11 1990s, I called Allen into my office" -- and told him there 12 wouldn't -- "and told him there would be tough times ahead." 13 "The banks were about to cut off our funding. Allen said, 14 'No problem,' and went be back to his office, where he 15 proceeded to renegotiate almost every payment from that point 16 forward." 17 "He did whatever was necessary to protect the bottom line --
18 and refused to succumb to the pressures of risk." 19 "Now he's negotiating with bankers on deals worth hundreds 20 of millions of dollars and he's so tough that most banks would 21 rather I negotiate the deal than him. He's a loyal employee 22 and he's the ultimate master at playing the cards of 23 business." 24 MS. MANGOLD: And then, lastly, can we pull up 25 what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 414D.

Always look at 20 the numbers yourself.

11 "He looks out for my bottom line as if the money were his 12 own." 13 MS. MANGOLD: No further questions. 14 THE COURT: You may inquire. 15 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor. 16 ***** 17 CROSS-EXAMINATION
18 BY MR. BLANCHE: 19 Q Good morning. 20 How are you, Ms. Franklin? 21 A Okay. Thank you. 22 Q Now, you said you have -- you are represented by 23 lawyers. 24 You are not paying for your own lawyers; are you? 25 A No.

7 never accept a contractor's first bid. Negotiate! Negotiate! 8 Or get out." 9 "Jeff got the message and has been with me for 17 years and 10 is doing a terrific job."
5 "The point I was making to Jeff was that even though various 6 payments always need to be made, always question invoices and 2533 3 A Yes.

1 Q So you mentioned that on both of these books there is a 2 second name on the front page, "Meredith McIver;" correct? 5 writer?" 4 Q And is what -- is her role sometimes called "a ghost 6 A It depends. Sure. I mean, I'm not sure exactly what 7 she -- how much she did for that book, but, sure, she could be a 8 ghost writer. 9 Q So when you said you're not sure, you mean you don't 10 know what role Ms. McIver had in these two books? 11 A I don't know how much she contributed. I know that 12 Donald Trump was the author of the book. I'm not sure how 13 exactly specifically she contributed. 14 Q And you're not sure because it varies depending on the 15 book, the primary author, and if there is a secondary author, it 16 could vary; correct?

17 A Yes.
18 Q So at times, does someone like Ms. McIver sit and 19 interview the primary author as the book is written? 20 A Ummm, I mean, I'm not sure exactly, again, what she 21 did. 22 Q I'm not asking you what she did -- 23 A Okay. 24 Q -- I'm just asking you, in your experience, is that 25 something that happened at times?

2534 1 A I think that she would have discussed it with him.

2 Q And there are times when a secondary author interviews 3 other people to help the primary author write the book? 4 A I -- I'm not sure. I don't -- I don't know. I don't 5 know. 6 Q But you don't know what role Miss McIver had in this, 7 in either of these books at all; correct? 8 A I don't. All I know is that she helped our primary 9 author in some way.

10 Q And you are -- you said you purchased both these books 11 in kind of the way any of us -- or similar to the way we would 12 purchase the book? 13 A No. The way that I purchased it is the way that an 14 employee of Penguin Random House would purchase it. 15 MR. BLANCHE: So if we could put up Exhibit 413. 16 Just the first page, briefly. 17 This can go for everybody.

21 A It's, it's -- usually we have a cover -- we have a 22 cover design department here. 23 And then they usually work with the author. 24 Q And is one of the goals of how you make the cover look, 25 to make it look presentable, so that you can sell copies of the 18 (Displayed.) 19 Q Who -- well, who decides how to make the cover? Like 20 what the cover should look like?

2535 1 book?

2 A One of our goals is selling copies of the book. But -- 3 but our authors are -- I mean, our goal is to make the authors 4 happy also. But, yes, we definitely want to sell copies of our 5 book. 6 Q Your goal is to make the authors happy, or what do you 7 mean? 8 A If they have approval over the cover, we consider that, 9 we consider that.

10 We also want to sell the book. 11 Q Sure. And because you are trying to make money off the 12 book; correct? 13 A That is correct. 14 Q And so -- and for this book, which is "How To Get 15 Rich," that book, it was about 320 pages; correct? 16 Approximately? 17 A I would have to double-check it.

18 Q Are you looking at it now? 19 A I can look at it. 20 Yes, it is approximately 320 pages. 21 Q And you were just shown redacted versions of five of 22 those pages, correct, and asked to read those portions? 23 A Yes. 24 MR. BLANCHE: If we could put up Exhibit 414, 25 please.

2536 1 (Displayed.)
2 Q For this book, you know that -- or maybe you will need 3 to check that it's approximately 283 pages? 4 A Yeah. Yes. 288. 5 Q Just so it's clear, you actually have both books in 6 front of you? 7 A (Witness indicating.) 8 Q And now are you holding it up to just confirm?

10 Q And you were asked to read, a few minutes ago, redacted 11 portions of about six pages of that 283 page book; correct? 12 A Yes. I don't remember the exact page. But, yes, 13 several pages. 14 Q And you didn't pick which portions to read; did you? 15 You just read what you were directed to read; correct? 16 A That is correct. 17 MR. BLANCHE: I don't have any further questions, 18 your Honor. 19 THE COURT: Thank you. 20 Any redirect? 21 MS. MANGOLD: Yes, your Honor. 22 ******* 23 REDIRECT EXAMINATION 24 BY MS. MANGOLD: 25 Q Now, Ms. Franklin, I believe Mr. Blanche was asking you 9 A Yes. (Witness indicating.)
2537 1 about the ghost writing process.

2 In your experience -- 3 A Yes, I'm sorry. 4 Q In your experience, do ghost writers ever write entire 5 books without the author's knowledge? 6 A No. 7 Q In your experience, do ghost writers ever create 8 content without any input from the author? 9 A No.

10 Q And is it your understanding that an author works for a 11 ghost writer or does a ghost writer work for the author? 12 A The ghost writer works for the author. 13 Q And are you aware of any books written by ghost writers 16 Q Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to 17 review People's Exhibit 414F, G and H for identification?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And are those excerpts of the book "How To Get Rich?" 20 A Yes. 21 Q Did you have an opportunity to compare the exhibits 22 with the copies of the book that you purchased? 23 A I did. 24 Q And are the exhibits exact copies of the book that you 25 purchased or portions of it?

14 where the author wasn't aware of the content of the book? 15 A No, I am not.

2538 1 A They are.

2 MS. MANGOLD: The People now offer exhibits 413F, 3 413G and 413H into evidence. 4 MR. BLANCHE: One moment, your Honor.

11 ****** 12 THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Blanche? 13 MR. BLANCHE: I just don't think these were on our 14 exhibit list, your Honor, and so I have never seen them 15 before. 16 MS. MANGOLD: I am not required to provide redirect 17 examination exhibits.

18 And, obviously, the redirect exhibits will depend 19 on the cross-examination. 20 MR. BLANCHE: Well, what was the cross-examination 21 that opened this up? 22 THE COURT: Tell me how this goes to the cross? 23 MS. MANGOLD: So Exhibits 413 -- and there are 24 similar ones for 414 -- are the dedication page, the 25 introduction and the acknowledgments page of each of those 10 (At Sidebar.)
8 MR. BLANCHE: May we approach, your Honor? 9 THE COURT: Yes. 7 ********** 6 (Counsel confer.) 5 THE COURT: All right.

2539 1 books showing quotes from the author and information that is 2 within the primary author's unique knowledge. 3 And to the extent that the defense is challenging 4 attribution, these establish that the defendant was aware of 5 statements in his -- throughout his book. 6 MR. BLANCHE: In no way did I challenge 7 attribution. 8 I just asked the witness to explain what a ghost 9 writer was; if she had any knowledge about the ghost writer.

10 That's not challenging attribution even a little bit. 11 THE COURT: You questioned that it was possible 12 that there were contents in that book that you are not 13 attributing to your client, that possibly it was written by 14 the ghost writer. I think it's fair. 15 MR. BLANCHE: I'm not allowed to introduce exhibits 16 that were never produced to the People, your Honor. 17 We did not open the door based upon a question 18 about just what a ghost writer is and what a ghost writer 19 may do. 20 Also, your Honor, as to exhibits that were not 21 produced to the Defense -- 22 THE COURT: You just asked one question about it? 23 MR. BLANCHE: Excuse me? 24 THE COURT: You just asked one question about it, 25 about a ghost writer?

2540 1 MR. BLANCHE: To help the jury understand what a 2 ghost writer is; not about this particular book. 3 She has no knowledge about this book. 4 MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, they also previously 5 elicited testimony from Rhona Graff that Meredith McIver was 6 a ghost writer for Mr. Trump. 7 And they raised objections in limine that these 8 exhibits should not be introduced altogether, that not all 9 of these exhibits can be attributed to Mr. Trump.

10 So that all of these -- 11 THE COURT: Based on your cross-examination, the 12 impression that I got, from the questions that you were 13 asking, was that you were calling into question just how 14 much control Mr. Trump had with the contents of the book. 15 I think this is fair. 16 I will allow it. 17 MR. BLANCHE: Well, your Honor --
18 (Sidebar concluded.) 19 ******* 20 MS. MANGOLD: Again, the People offer Exhibits 21 413F, 413G, and 413 H into evidence. 22 (Pause.) 25 THE COURT: The objection is noted and overruled. 23 MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, with your permission, can 24 those exhibits be admitted?

2541 1 People's 413F, G and H are accepted into evidence.

2 (So marked in evidence.) 3 MS. MANGOLD: Thank you, your Honor. 4 Can we please display for the jury what is in 5 evidence as People's Exhibit 413F. 6 (Displayed.)
9 Q Now, Ms. Franklin, I believe that you previously 10 testified that this exhibit and the next two are excerpts from 11 the book: "Trump: How To Get Rich;" is that right?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And is this a page from that book? 14 A It is.

15 Q Is this the dedication page?

19 A I'm sorry. It's a quote, like usually the dedication, 20 you know, the author dedicates the book to somebody. 21 This is a -- it's usually a quote from somebody very 22 important that the author wants to highlight to set up the 23 book. 24 Q And are there -- how many quotes are on this page?

25 A Two.

16 A It is not. It's the epigraph page.

17 Q What's the epigraph page?

18 Am I saying that correctly?

7 ******* 8 BY MS. MANGOLD:
2542

1 Q And who is the top quote attributed to?
2 A Mary Trump, the author's mother. 3 Q And who is the bottom quote attributed to? 4 A The author, Donald J. Trump. 5 Q Does it say "Donald J. Trump?" 6 A No. It says "DJT." You are right. I apologize. 7 Q And, in your experience, are the details -- are quotes 8 attributed to the author's mother something that would typically 9 be written by the ghost writer or the author?

10 A The author. 11 MS. MANGOLD: Can we now, please, display for the 12 jury what has been entered into evidence as People's 13 Exhibit 413G. 14 (Displayed.) 15 MS. MANGOLD: Can we show briefly all of the pages 16 of this exhibit. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q Ms. Franklin, do you know what part of the book this 19 is? 20 A Yes. It's the introduction. 21 MS. MANGOLD: Can you please turn to the second 22 page? 23 It looks like we may be having some technical 24 difficulties. 25 There you go.

2543 1 Q And can you see the Paragraph 1, 2, 3, four full 2 paragraphs down, starting with "How To Get Rich." 3 A Yes. 4 Q Can you please read that paragraph to the jury.

5 A Yes. "How To Get Rich: That's what I decided to call 6 it, because whenever I meet people, that's usually what they 7 want to know from me." 8 "You ask a baker how he makes bread. You ask a billionaire 9 how he makes money."
10 Q And, in your experience, is that the type of content 11 that would typically be provided by a ghost writer or the 12 author? 13 A The author. 14 MS. MANGOLD: Finally, can we pull up what's now 15 in evidence as People's Exhibit 413 H. 16 (Displayed.)
17 **********
18 Q Is this another excerpt from the book "Trump: How To 19 Get Rich?"
20 A Yes. 21 Q What section is this?

22 A The acknowledgments. 23 Q Can you please read the first paragraph of this to the 24 jury?

25 A Yes. "This book could not have been written without 2544 1 Meredith McIver, a writer of many talents."
2 "She served her apprenticeship with the New York City 10 Q Now, is the author's description of a secondary writer 11 helping put thoughts and experiences on paper, consistent with 12 your understanding of what a ghost writer does? 13 A Yes. 16 (Displayed.) 17 Q And can you please read this page to the jury?

18 A "I want to thank my editor at Random House, Jonathan 19 Karp, who asked me to write this book. I first met Jon in 1997 20 when he edited the Art of The Comeback." 21 "He spent a lot of time in my office, and one day I noticed 22 he was staring at the carpet under my desk. Finally he said, 23 Donald, what's the deal with the space heater? I told him that 24 my feet get cold." 25 "Jon said, We're in Trump Tower. It's your building. Can't 6 "As you know, my door is always open so Meredith has heard 7 everything and she's taken good notes." 8 "She's done a remarkable job of helping me put my thoughts 9 and experience on paper. I am tremendously grateful to her."

3 Ballet, worked on Wall Street, and for the past two years has 4 been an Executive Assistant at The Trump Organization stationed 5 at a desk outside my office."
2545 1 you do something about that?"
2 "It's important to have an editor who asks the tough 3 questions." 4 "I'm also grateful to many others at Random House who worked 5 long and late hours to produce this book in record time: 6 Publisher Gina Centrello; Associate Publishers Anthony 7 Ziccardi and Elizabeth McGuire; Executive Director of Publicity 8 Carol Schneider; Director of Publicity Thomas Perry; Associate 9 Director of Publicity Elizabeth Fogarty; Editorial Assistants 13 Carol Löwenstein; Production Manager Richard Elman; Production 14 Editor Janet Wygal; Copy Editor Ginny Carroll; Advertising 15 Director Magee Finn; Rights Directors Claire Tisne and Rachel 16 Bernstein; and everyone at the Random House Sales Force, which 17 is the best in the business."
18 Do you recognize the names referenced on this page? 19 A Yes. 20 Q Are those all employees of Penguin Random House or were 21 they at some time? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And in your experience, is this type of content 24 consistent with something an author would write who was very 25 involved in the writing process?

10 Jonathan Jao, who did an excellent job with the photos, and 11 Casey Rivish; art director Gene Mydlowski; Managing Editor 12 Benjamin Dreyer; Production Chief Lisa Feuer; Design Director 2546 1 A Yes.

2 Q Now, before testifying today, did you also have the 3 opportunity to review what has been marked for identification as 4 People's Exhibits 414E, 414F and 414G? 5 A I did. 6 Q Are those additional excerpts from the book "Trump: 7 How To Be A Billionaire?" 8 A Yes. 9 Q And --
10 A "Think Like a Billionaire." 11 Q I'm sorry. 12 A All right. 13 Q "Think Like a Billionaire." 14 Did you compare the exhibits to the versions of the book 15 that you purchased? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And are the exhibits exact copies of portions of that 18 book? 19 A They are. 20 MS. MANGOLD: The People now offer exhibits 414E, 21 F and G into evidence. 22 MR. BLANCHE: No objection. 24 (So marked in evidence.) 25 ********* 23 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

2547 1 MS. MANGOLD: Now, can we please display for the 4 Q And can you remind me what you called this page?

5 A This is the Epigraph page.

19 Q Ms. Franklin, do you know what this is?

20 A Yes. This is the introduction for "Think Like a 22 Q And looking at the first page of the exhibit, is that 23 Page XI? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Roman Numeral 11?

6 Q And is it -- are there multiple quotes on this page?

7 A Yes, there are three. 8 Q And who is the top quote attributed to? 9 A The author's father, Fred Trump.

10 Q And is this the type of thing that would come from a 11 ghost writer or the author?

12 A Author. 13 MS. MANGOLD: Can we now show the jury what's in 14 evidence as People's Exhibit 414 F.

15 (Displayed.) 16 Q And can you flip through the pages of this exhibit, 17 please.

2548 1 A Yes.

2 Q Can you please read the bottom paragraph of that 3 page? 7 "Consider this new book the second part of an ongoing 8 conversation between you and The Donald." 9 "The billionaire's equivalent of those best selling works of 10 inspiration, conversations with God and conversations with God 11 Book 2." 12 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please turn to the next page 13 of the exhibit, please. 14 (Displayed.) 15 Q And can you read the last two full paragraphs on the 16 second page of the exhibit. 17 A "Here's something else about God that any billionaire 18 knows: He's in the details. And you need to be there too. I 19 couldn't run a business any other way." 20 "When I'm talking to a contractor or examining a site or 21 planning a new development, no detail is too small to consider. 22 I even try to sign as many checks as possible." 23 "For me, there's nothing worse than a computer signing a 24 check. 25 "When you sign a check yourself" --
4 A "In my previous book, 'How To Get Rich,' I shared some 5 of my favorite techniques for running a profitable business and 6 becoming a TV Megastar."
2549 1 Q I'm sorry. Was it "a computer signing a check?"
2 A Oh, sorry. "For me, there's nothing worse than a 3 computer signing checks." 6 "And if people see your signature at the bottom of a check, 7 they know you're watching them, and they screw you less because 8 they have proof that you care about the details." 9 MS. MANGOLD: And can we show this paragraph in 10 combination with the next full paragraph, please. 11 (Displayed.) 12 Q Can you read the next full paragraph, please? 13 A "I learned how to think like a billionaire by watching 14 my father, Fred Trump." 15 "He was the greatest man I'll ever know, and the biggest 16 influence on my life." 17 Q Ms. Franklin, in your experience, are references to the 18 author's childhood something that would typically come from the 19 author or the ghost writer? 20 A The author. 21 Q And is the content of this portion of the introduction 22 consistent with the other content from the books that we've 23 looked at? 24 A Yes. 25 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please now turn to People's 4 "When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing what's really 5 going on inside your business."
2550 1 Exhibit 414G, already in evidence.

2 (Displayed.) 3 Q Can you describe what this is? 4 A The acknowledgments for "Think Like a Billionaire." 5 Q And can you read the first sentence of this to the 6 jury, please? 7 A "Like my previous book, 'How To Get Rich,' this book 8 never would have happened without the hard work and help of 9 Meredith McIver. Also, Norma Foerderer, who manages my 10 schedule, kept this project on schedule." 11 Q And, again, is this consistent with your understanding 12 of how authors and ghost writers work together? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And then can you read to yourself the next paragraph, 15 please. 16 A To myself? 17 Q Yeah, just to yourself. You don't need to read the 18 whole thing. 19 (Pause.) 20 A Got it. 21 Q Like the acknowledgment section of the prior book, does 22 this section of the acknowledgments of this book also list 23 employees of Penguin Random House? 24 A It does. 25 Q And is it the author's -- withdrawn.

2551 1 To your knowledge, are all of these people actual employees 2 of the company Penguin Random House? 3 A Yes. 4 MS. MANGOLD: No further questions. 5 ******* 6 RECROSS-EXAMINATION 7 BY MR. BLANCHE: 8 MR. BLANCHE: Can we just put that last exhibit up, 9 please, and turn to the second page, 414G.

10 (Displayed.) 11 MR. BLANCHE: We don't have these exhibits so we 12 needed to ask the People to put it up. 13 THE COURT: All right. You can put it up. 14 MR. BLANCHE: If you can highlight the last 15 paragraph. 16 Just blow it up, please. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q Is this the second page of what you were just reading 19 from, "Acknowledgments?" 20 A I believe so, yes. 21 Q And -- 22 A Yes. 23 Q You can look at it if you need to, that's okay. 24 A Okay. 25 Q And this is the second page of the acknowledgments.

2552 1 You read the first -- a portion of the first page.

2 And that's just Meredith McIver listing folks that she wants 3 to thank also for her help; correct? 4 A Yes. 5 MR. BLANCHE: No further questions. 6 THE COURT: That's it? 7 MS. MANGOLD: Nothing further, your Honor. Thank 8 you. 9 THE COURT: You can step down.

10 THE WITNESS: Okay. 11 Thank you. 12 (Witness excused.) 13 ******* 14 THE COURT: Counsel, please approach. 16 ****** 15 (At Sidebar.) 17 THE COURT: So I just want to go back for a second 18 to Ms. Necheles' objection earlier. 19 She referenced her objection to feelings coming 20 out. 21 Did you also refer to feelings, that you wanted to 22 get into the feelings of Ms. Daniels? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: I think she's going to describe a 24 little bit about how she felt at the time, because it 25 corroborates what happened.

2553 1 Look, I think her account of what happened on that 2 day is the account that would have been told to the American 3 people prior to the election had she not entered into the 4 NDA. 5 It's significant. 6 THE COURT: Give me a sense of what she's going to 7 say when she talks about her feelings, how she felt that 8 day? 9 MS. HOFFINGER: I mean, she's going to say, for 10 example, at certain times she felt feelings leaving her 11 hands and toes, that she felt that she was having a panic 12 attack at one point. 13 She will describe that some details came back to 14 her later after seeing a movie called Bombshell, for 15 example, which I think will help to explain certain times 16 about what she remembered and what she didn't remember. 17 So it's not going to be in great detail, but I
18 think it's significant because for a period of time she 19 didn't remember how she got into bed and had sex with 20 him. 21 And so I think it's important to bring out 22 partly how she was feeling at the time, because it explains 23 that. 24 And, again, the defense opened the door from the 25 start to credibility issues.

2554 17 fabrication. There are prior consistent statements and so I
18 image we will it deal with that at that time. 19 THE COURT: To the extent that it helps to explain 20 that she had forgotten some things and she remembered 21 certain other things, I will allow it. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 24 felt when she got into the bed and feelings while lying 25 there, I think we should wait and see what happens on 1 This is the account that would have been told to 2 the American people had she not entered into the NDA. 3 She entered into the NDA willingly, but had she not 4 entered into the NDA, this is what would have been told to 5 the American people. And that's why they wanted to pay her 6 to remain silent. 7 MS. NECHELES: Judge, it's not the account that 8 would have been told. 9 Her story has changed over time.

10 And if they go into this, we will have to go into 11 how her story has changed. 12 This is all a fabrication. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: This is not new. This is not a 14 fabrication nor has her story changed. 15 I think we will be able to establish, if the 16 defense goes into this -- they are saying that this is a new 23 THE COURT: To the extent that it goes into how she 2555 1 cross-examination.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: So, in other words, I can't elicit 3 how she felt at the time? 4 That she was -- it explains why there are certain 5 details she still doesn't remember. 6 THE COURT: What do you expect her to say with 7 respect to that? 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Precisely what I said. 9 She's going to say that she felt numb. She didn't 10 expect it to happen. 11 She felt numb. 12 At one point she almost felt like she was having a 13 panic attack, and she has not been able to remember some of 14 the details. 15 And some of the details she has always remembered, 16 and some of the details -- precisely how she got from the 17 bathroom to the bed -- some of them came back to her in 2019 18 when she saw a certain movie. 19 THE COURT: All right. 20 MS. HOFFINGER: So I think it explains what we 21 expect the defense will do, and what they've indicated that 22 they will do. 23 So in our direct we are entitled to bring this out 24 and draw the sting in order to explain -- 25 MS. NECHELES: Well, we would not be going there if 2556 1 the Prosecutor wasn't going there, so it's not drawing the 2 sting out of -- they are putting in very prejudicial 3 material, and they are not drawing the sting out, they are 4 essentially making this into rape, which is totally 5 improper, that she felt threatened and -- 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Let me make this clear --
7 MS. NECHELES: And that she felt threatened into 8 doing it. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Let me make this clear. She has 10 always said, and she did not say -- she will not say that, 11 she will not say that this is a sexual assault, that will 12 not be her account, has not been her account and never has 13 been. 14 So to the extent that that is the way that the 15 defense is characterizing that, I will make that clear and 16 she will make that clear.

17 MS. NECHELES: Judge, there is, additionally, 18 another area that I don't know whether the prosecutors 19 intend to go into, but I would ask that she be precluded 20 from being asked. 21 She has said on various occasions, starting in 22 2018, that she and her daughter were threatened by some 23 random man. 24 THE COURT: That she?

25 MS. NECHELES: That she and her daughter's lives 2557 10 First of all, the defense opened the door in their 11 cross-examination of Keith Davidson. 12 They put in the clip saying that Avenatti said 13 something about her story of being threatened in a parking 14 lot in 2011 by a man as being not true. 15 It is also the basis of a defamation claim, which 16 the defense opened the door to on their opening when they 17 said that this is all just about the fact that she owes him 18 some legal fees having to do with that case.

9 There are a few things that I would say. 5 President Trump in any way on this, and so we would ask that 6 that be precluded. 7 MS. HOFFINGER: We are not suggesting that it was 8 President Trump who did that. 4 believe her story -- but there is also just no connection to 3 And there is no connection at all to -- I don't 1 were threatened by some random man in a parking lot and 2 that's why she didn't tell her story earlier.

19 So they've opened the door. 20 It also goes to, your Honor, directly to why she 21 didn't tell her story at various times. So it's a critical 22 piece. 23 They've opened the door to it. And we should be 24 allowed to elicit it. 25 THE COURT: The latter issue that you say they did 2558 1 open the door to --
2 MS. HOFFINGER: Uh-huh. 3 THE COURT: You can step back and just give me a 4 second to think about that. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Sure. 6 And, your Honor, if I may ask for a few minutes 7 before we start. 8 (Sidebar concluded.) 9 *******
10 THE COURT: I'm sorry. 11 Come back, please. 12 (Start Sidebar.) 13 THE COURT: On the direct examination, I'm going to 14 ask you to not get into the feelings that you -- that you 15 just described. 16 You can get into the sexual act, that there was a 17 sexual act.

18 Of course, you can talk about how she got there; 19 how she ended up in the room. Just the facts. You can get 20 into the facts. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Just don't ask her how she felt at 22 the time? 23 THE COURT: Well, I don't want to get into how she 24 felt emotionally at that time. 25 I don't want you to get into that on your direct.

2559 1 We will wait to see what happens on 2 cross-examination. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. 4 THE COURT: And maybe at that time we can revisit 5 it. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay.

7 THE COURT: Okay. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Uh-huh.

12 please. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: The People call Stormy Daniels, 14 your Honor.

18 Good morning. 19 A Hi. 20 Q Ms. Daniels, have you also been known as Stephanie 21 Clifford? 22 A Yes. 23 Q What name do you prefer that we use here in court? 25 Q Now, are you testifying here today pursuant to a 24 A Stormy Daniels.

2561 1 subpoena?

2 A Yes, I am. 3 Q Without providing any specific names, can you tell the 4 jury a little bit about your family? 5 A Sure. I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, 6 Louisiana. 9 Now I live in Florida with my partner.

10 And I share custody of my young daughter with her dad. 11 Q And how long have you known your partner? 12 A I have known him for almost 25 years. 13 Q Tell the jury a little bit about your life growing up 14 in Louisiana? 15 A Like I said, I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, 16 Louisiana. 17 My parents split up when I was four years old. I was mostly 18 raised by mom. 19 Very low income family. She was a single working mom. 20 I went to a private, very Christian, very strict elementary 21 school that my dad paid for. 22 And then I entered the magnet system, which is for -- you 23 have to maintain a certain GPA in middle and high school. 24 I went to an engineering high school because I wanted to be 25 a veterinarian and they had the best recommendation for getting 7 My parents divorced when I was four, so I was raised mostly 8 by my mom.

2562 1 into college and for getting scholarships.

2 So I graduated from Scotlandville Magnet High School in 3 1997. 4 I graduated top ten percent of my class for the country, and 5 applied to both LSU Veterinarian School and Texas A & M. 6 I received a full scholarship from Texas A & M for 7 veterinary medicine, and -- but even that still requires you to 8 pay for things that aren't included in scholarships. 9 So I took a year off from that and never actually got to go 10 back. 12 correct? 11 Q So you never actually went -- you didn't go to college; 13 A Correct. But I did take college classes in high 14 school. 15 Q And did you participate in some clubs in high school? 16 A Yes, I did.

23 And then I was, aside from the regular 4-H, I was in the 24 Equine Department of -- the 4-H Department, which is the 25 equestrian horseback riding part of that.

17 Q What kind of clubs or hobbies were you involved with 18 when you were in high school? 19 A I was editor of my high school paper, so I was in the 20 journalist club. 21 I was in 4-H because I loved horses and, also, so they would 22 write a recommendation for veterinary school.

2563 1 And I was in the Baton Rouge Ballet Company.

2 Q And I'm going to ask you to slow down just a little bit 3 so that the court reporter can get it all down and also so that 4 the jury can hear you. 5 A I'm sorry. 6 Q It's all right. 7 I'm sorry. 8 Did you do some work during high school, some paperwork? 9 A Yes, I did. I taught handicap rider lessons at the 10 stable where I kept my horse in exchange for board and feed for 11 my horse and riding lessons. 12 And I shoved manure. (Laughter). 13 And then later I went on to dancing. 14 Q Okay. Tell us about the dancing, when you went on to 15 that? 16 A I was 17, I think, and a friend of mine -- I met a 17 friend who told me that she was a dancer.

18 I thought she meant the same kind of dancing that I did, 19 which was ballet and jazz and tap. 20 I was wrong. (Laughter.) 21 She was an exotic dancer and invited me to the club to see 22 her dance; and they didn't bother to check my ID. 23 So I started dancing on the weekends, which was actually 24 kind of cool because I didn't have to miss any classes and could 25 still make more in two nights than I did shoveling manure eight 2564 1 hours a day. (Laughter).

2 (Whereupon, at this time, Principal Court Reporter 3 Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Lisa Kramsky as the official 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2565 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 3 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 4 Q So, you started making some money then in high school, 5 is that right? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And did you move out of your mother's house at some 8 point?

10 Q During or shortly after high school? 11 A When I was 17.

12 Q And just briefly, why did you move out of your 13 mother's house, just briefly? 14 A My mother was very neglectful. She would disappear 15 for days at a time. I wish I could say that she was an addict 17 I really don't know. We lived in a really bad neighborhood, 18 and she would just vanish. 19 And so, finally, it came to a head right around 20 Christmastime of my senior year. And my -- and then I left for 21 a little bit for a couple of weeks. And then I came home. And 22 since I was 17, which in Louisiana at that time you are 23 considered an adult, so I moved out. 24 Q And have you supported yourself ever since?

25 A Yes.

16 of some sort, that would kind of be an excuse, but to this day 9 A Yes, ma'am.

2566 4 Q Why did you do that?

5 A Well, I was working at the club, as I said, and we 6 would have, like, guest stars. They are called featured 18 So, if you are a regular girl in the club, you can 19 come and perform, but if you were like in Playboy, or Playboy 20 centerfolds, or one of those people, then you could be a 21 headliner.

22 So, you would have to have what they would call 23 credentials or credits. 24 And so, I asked a lot of those performers how they got 25 those, and, of course, they said you have to have these credits 9 They put on very fancy burlesque shows. They either 10 breathe fire or do aerial, stilts, just like they are the star 11 performance and they give them all the special treatment.

12 And because I had this background in actual dancing, 13 and I was like, I want to do that, but you have to have some 14 sort of -- a reason to be the headliner. You have to have a 15 reason they pay you to come in and be the star. And the way to 16 do that is either to pose for magazines or do competitions or 17 to do adult movies.

1 Q Now, did there come a time that you started also doing 2 some other work, for example, nude modeling for some magazines? 3 A Yes, when I was 21. 7 entertainers. For those that don't know, it's like traveling 8 acts that come in, and they headline at the club.

2567 1 or a reason to be the star. And they connected me with some 2 photographers and videographers, and I went on to pose for some 3 magazines to get the accolades, I guess, to be able to go on 4 tour as the featured entertainer.

5 Q Would that enable you to make more money? 6 A Yes. Obviously you get paid for that.

7 Q How old were you when you started that work? 8 A Twenty-one. 9 Q Now, did there come a time that you also worked in the 10 adult film industry? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Why did you move into doing that work? 13 A It started the same way I just explained. 14 So, when you had those -- you were this guest star, 15 this featured entertainer, you can do contests, and you could 16 really -- you could literally be Miss Nude North America or you 19 They top out on a pay grade, and the people who make 20 the most for their appearances were the people who, the girls, 21 performers who had done adult films.

22 And I topped out of rate and was doing really well. I 23 never had any sort of issue with nudity or sex or adult films. 24 Went to California with a girlfriend of mine who was out there 25 to do a shoot. And she obviously just wanted me to go with 17 can do magazines, like I said, but each one of these are sort 18 of like a level.

2568 1 her, and I never went to California.

2 She said, I will pay for your trip. I am so scared. 3 So I went with her. I was an extra, like a completely clothed 4 background extra, in a bar on her shoots.

5 And the director, who is a very famous director, from 6 a famous adult company, Wicked Pictures, saw me, and said he 7 actually thought I was already an adult actress and asked me if 8 I would be in another movie. 9 I honestly was kind of scared to do it. And she said, 12 So I said, yes. And I will cut out a lot of the other 13 details, and five days later she got on a plane to fly back 14 home, and I got offered a contract at Wicked Pictures.

15 Q And how old were you at the time? 16 A Twenty-three.

17 Q Did there come a time that you started writing for 18 adult films? 19 A Yes, about six months later.

20 Q Were you still about 23-years old? 21 A I was 23, yes.

22 Q Do you continue to write for adult films? 23 A Yes, I still do. 24 Q And did there come a time when you started directing 25 in that industry?

10 I will do it with you, and just doing one you can say you have 11 done it, and it bumps you up in pay grade.

2569 1 A Yes. I directed my first adult film, it was a 2 feature, which is -- there are two kinds of films. One that is 3 like not scripted and you are just sort of like seen. There is 4 no thinking or you don't have to learn dialogue or whatever.

5 And then there are adult features that are very 6 scripted, kind of the ones if you cut out the really naughty 7 stuff, you will see on TV late at night. They are, basically, 8 actual movies that have sex. 9 That's what the company I wrote for did.

10 I was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, adult 11 feature director and definitely the youngest female feature 12 director. I started directing when I was 23, and I have 13 directed over 150 films, and I have won 11 best director awards 14 and two best screenplays. 17 A Yes.

18 Q Could you give the jury examples of those you did? 19 A Sure. I was in a movie called 40-Year-Old Virgin, 20 Knocked Up, Finding Bliss, a whole bunch. 21 I have been in TV shows too.

22 Q I will just ask you to slow down a little bit. 23 A I was in a television show called The Dirt with 24 Courteney Cox, Superbad.

25 Q And have you also acted in some music videos?

15 Q And have you also acted in what we would call 16 mainstream movies?

2570 1 A Yes. I did some music videos for Maroon 5, a band 2 called Granny 4 Barrel, Rob Zombie. 3 Q Have you also directed some music videos? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Have you also written or are you writing some books?

8 Q And the name of the book you completed? 9 A Well, the book that I completed was released in 2018, 10 it's called Full Disclosure, and two more are coming out next 11 year.

12 Q And have you also done some comedy shows? 17 A The podcast was called Beyond the Norm. It was sort 18 of anything that is beyond the norm. It was about anything 19 from like serial killers, female serial killers, to UFO
20 abductions, paranormal stuff, porn. That's not -- it's beyond 21 the norm, politics, anything like that.

22 Q In connection with the podcast that might have 23 involved politics, in some of those, did you discuss Mr. Trump 24 or your experience with him?

25 A Yes, of course.

13 A Yes. 14 Q Have you also in the past hosted a podcast?

15 A Yes. 16 Q What was the podcast about?

6 A Yes. I have written a book and I am in the process of 7 finishing up two others.

2571 1 Q Do you still host that podcast?

2 A Sadly, no, I don't. 3 Q Why not? 4 A Because I got fired.

5 Q Why was that? 6 A Because I was reluctant to continue talking about just 7 that one narrative about this case, and about, um -- like 8 politics, I was told I could pick a variety of things to talk 9 about, and they just kept going down this one subject line.

13 A Correct. 14 Q Were you recently featured in a documentary?

15 A Yes. 16 Q What, briefly, was the documentary about?

17 A About my life and my story.

18 Q Included in that documentary, did you also speak about 19 Mr. Trump and your experience with him?

20 A Yes. 21 Q In about 2009, did you also explore running in the 22 Republican Primary for Senate in Louisiana? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Can you tell the jury a little about that?

25 A In 2009, let's see, I got an email from a friend 11 Q It is because of that subject line that you do not 12 have the podcast?

10 And --
2572 1 saying, did you know about this?

2 There is a guy in Louisiana -- first, it came at me as 3 this person is using your name, your trademark name, and your 4 image to promote himself.

24 loved to use, but David Vitter would never actually -- he 25 wouldn't debate me.

8 And I got really mad; and, basically, got ahold of the 9 guy, his name was Brian Welsh, and went after him to stop using 10 my name and image to promote himself. But it wasn't to promote 11 himself, it. Was to bring attention to this candidate, the 12 Republican candidate in Louisiana who was running on a platform 13 of like -- who was anti-women and was trying to shut down like 14 reproductive rights and sex education in school and Planned 15 Parenthood. 16 Meanwhile, he got caught doing some unsavory things.

17 And he had no intention of making me the Senator, but I was 18 helping to bring attention. I jumped on board, and, basically, 19 was saying that I was a better choice than this guy.

20 But I dropped out. I never wanted to actually move 21 back to Louisiana. I didn't want to establish residency. I
22 made a lot more money doing the job that I was doing at the 23 time, which made for some fun campaign slogans I would have 5 She was, actually, a little bit wrong. It was a Draft 6 Stormy Campaign, and it was to go against the Republican David 7 Vitter, Senator David Vitter.

1 Q So just to clarify, so was the platform that you were 2 interested in running on was to promote sex education and 3 women's reproductive rights? 4 A Correct.

5 Q And if you had run, you would be running as a 6 Republican, correct?

7 A Correct. 8 Q I would like now to direct your attention to July of 9 2006.

10 Were you working at a celebrity golf tournament in 11 Lake Tahoe at that time?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And for whom were you working at the time? 14 A I was still under contract with Wicked Pictures, the 15 adult film company. 16 Q Contract, meaning you were both a director and a 17 writer and also an actress?

18 A Yes, ma'am. 19 Q And what were you and others from Wicked Entertainment 20 doing at this golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July of 2006? 21 A So, Wicked sponsors one of the holes on the golf 22 course, which, yes, I know it's very funny. We are an adult 23 film company sponsoring one of the holes. 24 And we had a table in the gift room where celebrities 25 would come through, get a gift bag, check out the products, 2573 2574 1 pose for photos. And that's pretty common in any sort of 2 event. They usually have a gift room and even the award shows 3 have these. It's very common. 4 Q So you went with others from your company to promote 5 the company? 6 A Right. It was myself, the owner of the company, a 7 couple of the staff from the company, and some of the contract 14 A Yes, I did.

15 Q Can you describe how you encountered him on the golf 17 A It was a very brief encounter. The players were 18 playing. They came through very quickly. We met every person 19 who was in the golf tournament at that moment. They came 20 through. 21 Obviously, they would take their shot.

22 I would say, hello, and introduce myself to them. I 23 introduced myself, the company, and the other contract girls, 24 not just to Mr. Trump, but every player that came through.

25 Gave them water, posed for pictures.

8 girls, and the players would come around. You would stay at 9 your hole that had the company's logo, and you would give them 10 water, towels, take a photo. And then later the next day, or 11 whatever, the evening, they would go to the gift rooms.

12 Q And did you meet Donald Trump on the golf course at 13 that celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe?

16 course?

2575 1 It was a very brief encounter on the course.

2 Q Do you recall, if at all, what you discussed with 3 Mr. Trump on the golf course at that time? 4 A It wasn't very much. So, you know, the owner of the 5 company was like, this is my contract girl Jessica, and this is 6 my contract star and director Stormy Daniels.

7 And that's when he acted like, oh, you actually direct 8 too? You must be the smart one. And there is a picture and 9 they moved on.

10 Q And what did you know about Mr. Trump at the time, if 11 anything?

12 A Well, that he was, obviously, a golfer, and that he 13 had a television show I had never seen called Celebrity 14 Apprentice or The Apprentice, and he had done some reality TV
15 things. 16 Q Do you recall what the reality TV things were that you 17 knew about at the time?

18 A He did a lot of cameos and things like that. I 19 definitely remember seeing movies, commercials or whatever and 20 something -- something for wrestling, which I am from 21 Louisiana. It's a big deal.

22 Q How old were you at the time? 23 A Twenty-seven. 24 Q And did you know his approximate age, or could you 25 tell his approximate age at the time?

2576 3 Q So, would that -- how old was your father at the time? 4 A So, 60.

5 Q Did you see Mr. Trump again inside the gift room that 6 you mentioned previously?

17 He specifically asked for the one that I had directed.

18 At that time, it was only one that was out that I had 19 both -- well, all three, written, directed and starred in. And 20 that was the movie called Three Wishes. So I made sure that he 21 got that one.

22 We talked very briefly. 23 Then I saw him talking to his -- his -- it's his 24 security, but I didn't know that it was his security then at 25 the time. I thought maybe it was his friend. I saw him 7 A Yes. 8 Q And could you just describe that encounter in the gift 9 room, briefly?

10 A Sure. Like I mentioned, everybody came through. 11 There were so many photos with the girls with all the 12 celebrities that came through that day. He did remember us 13 from the golf course. 14 He talked to all of the girls. He remembered me, 15 specifically, that I was the smart one. He asked for a DVD. 16 We did we have a DVD. We had our adult films there.

1 A I didn't know his age. I knew he was probably old or 2 older than my father.

2577 1 talking to another gentleman that was with him.

2 And then he said that -- he came back and asked, said 3 that Mr. Trump would like to know if I would like to have 4 dinner with him.

5 Q Before we get to that. 6 You also took a picture with Mr. Trump inside the golf 7 room? 9 Q I am sorry. Inside the gift room?

10 A The gift room, yes. 11 Q Did you take pictures with other celebrities or other 12 folks that were coming through? 13 A Yes. Pretty much every celebrity that came through we 14 took a photo of.

15 Q Do you see Mr. Trump in the courtroom today? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Could you just point him out and indicate an article 18 of clothing that he is wearing? 19 A Navy blue jacket, second at the table.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: Indicating the Defendant, your 21 Honor.

22 THE COURT: Yes. 23 Q Now, you mentioned a photo that you took with 24 Mr. Trump, is that right?

10 Q Is this also one of the photos that you reviewed on 11 the thumb drive?

12 A Yes, it is. 13 Q Do you recognize it? 14 A Yes.

15 Q What is it? 16 A It is a photo of my phone and the contact in it.

17 Q And is it a particular photo from your phone of the 18 contact for Keith? 19 A Yes, it is.

20 Q Now, do you notice that the phone number for Keith is 21 redacted to show only the last four digits of his number?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Have you had a chance to also review and compare it 24 against the original contact in your phone with the full 25 numbers?

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show just to the witness 8 now, People's Exhibit 229-A for identification. Just to 9 the witness, the parties and to the Court.

1 A Yes.

2583 2 Q Aside from the redactions, is it exactly the same?

3 A Yes, it is a match. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: I now offer People's Exhibit 5 229-A in evidence, your Honor. 9 We are jumping a little. We will get back to 10 228. I apologize. 11 THE COURT: Okay. Accepted into evidence.

12 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
13 Q Tell us what that contact shows. 14 A It says -- it is saved under the name, Keith Trump, 15 that I put Trump because I didn't know his last name when I 16 saved it. And then the phone number that he texted me from 17 that I saved.

21 A I know a lot of people named Keith, and I wanted to 22 make sure I knew which one, which Keith it was, and because I
23 didn't know his last name, at least I know who he works for. 24 I do that a lot, put the name -- it's stupid -- or I 25 put where they are from. 18 Q And in listing it in your phone as Keith Trump, you 19 said you didn't know his last name, why did you put the name 20 Trump there?

7 THE COURT: Was that 228 or 229?

8 MS. HOFFINGER: It was, actually, 229-A. 6 MS. NECHELES: No objection.

2584 1 Q Was it the fact that he worked for Mr. Trump that you 2 put the last name Trump in your phone? 3 A Correct. 4 Q Do you still have Keith's contact in your phone to 5 this day? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Now, after you left the golf tournament, did you speak 8 with anyone else about the dinner invitation from Mr. Trump 9 that Keith extended to you?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Who did you discuss it with?

12 A Immediately, my then publicist. His name was Mike. 17 A So, I was scheduled to have a dinner or to go to 18 dinner with everyone from the company that I worked for, and I 19 really didn't want to go to that dinner. There was a couple of 20 people at that dinner that I didn't want to be around, you 21 know, cat fight and stuff.

22 And so, I said, well, I can go to this, not that I 23 ever would. 24 And he said, wait, this is amazing. You totally 25 should. What better excuse do you have to get out of this 13 He was the first, and I think the only one that immediately I 14 talked to about it.

15 Q And what -- could you tell us a little bit about the 16 conversation with Mike and what it led you to end up doing?

2585 1 dinner than that you are going to have dinner with Donald 2 Trump. If nothing else, you will get a big story, and it will 3 be good to get you out of this dinner. He said, I think you 4 should go. It will make for a great story. He is a business 5 guy. Like, what could possibly go wrong? 6 That was his words to me.

7 Q Did he persuade you that it would be good for your 8 career?

11 At the best, maybe he can get you a pilot with an 12 agent or something like that. 13 Q Did you end up going to his hotel, Mr. Trump's hotel, 14 to have dinner with him?

15 A I did. 16 Q How did that come about?

17 A Keith messaged me -- I don't remember who messaged 18 first. 19 I messaged back and forth with Keith and set it up to 20 arrange for me to go across town to where Mr. Trump was 21 staying. It was not the same hotel I was staying at, and I
22 meet him for dinner. 23 Q Do you recall what hotel Mr. Trump was staying at? 24 A I believe it was Harrah's. It was not the same one as 25 me.

9 A Yes, he implied. He said, at the very least, he could 10 probably have some interesting advice.

2586 1 Q How did you get to the hotel? How did you travel to 2 the hotel? 3 A So, I was originally was going to walk. I set out to 4 do that and realized that I had made a poor footwear decision 5 and that choice -- and, actually, ended up meeting with a 6 friend of mine about halfway, talking to her, and then I took a 7 car the rest of the way. 8 Q Did you indicate to your friend that you were going to 9 have dinner with Mr. Trump?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Can you describe -- do you know, approximately, what 12 time you arrived at Harrah's Hotel that night? 13 A I was in the car, I believe, at sunset. 14 Q Can you describe when you got to the hotel, arriving 15 at the hotel and going inside? 16 A Yes. So, I arrived, and I went upstairs. Keith had 17 given me very specific instructions to take a certain elevator 18 up to the penthouse floor. It was the only way to get there, I 19 guess.

20 And so, I did so, and I went up to that level. And 21 that is where I met Keith. He was waiting for me outside of 22 the door. 23 Q How did you get into Mr. Trump's hotel suite? 24 A The door was actually open. It was cracked open and 25 his bodyguard, Keith, was standing right outside the double 1 doors to his room.

2587 2 He said, hi, nice evening, you look nice, one or two 3 sentences of pleasantries, and said, go on in. 4 The door was already open. So I walked on in.

5 He said, Mr. Trump is there waiting for you. 6 Q You have to slow down a little bit for the court 10 A I didn't really have any expectations other than he 11 had said, Keith had said, just come up here, meet up here, and 12 then you guys can go downstairs together to one of the -- I 13 mean, the hotel had lots of really nice restaurants. So, we 14 would just go down to have dinner. That was my only 15 expectation, that I would have to have dinner that I didn't 16 want to with somebody else.

17 Q Can you describe the first room that you saw when you 18 entered the hotel suite? 19 A Inside the room?

20 Q Yes. The first room you entered when you entered the 21 penthouse.

22 A It wasn't really a room. It was like a foyer. Foyer. 23 Q What did it look like? 24 A It was just; like a little area, round shape, black 25 and white tiled floors in the center, a big, beautiful wooden 8 What were your expectations in going to meet him that 9 night at the hotel room? 7 reporter.

1 table. It looked very heavy, like a mahogany or something, 2588 2 super fancy, with a big flower arrangement and a light above 3 it, and it was very, very nice. 4 Q Did you mention anything about the floor?

5 A The black and white tile. 6 Q Did you mention that?

7 I might have missed it. I apologize. 8 Now, describe, if you would, where you first 9 encountered Mr. Trump inside of the hotel suite?

10 A It was right there inside of the doorway by the table 11 with the flowers. And I called his name. I said, hello.

12 And he came from one of the main areas of the hotel 13 suite.

16 A Yes. He was wearing silk or satin pajamas, like 17 two-piece pajamas, that I immediately made fun of him for, and 18 said, does Mr. Hefner know you stole his pajamas? 19 Q Who were you referring to when you said, Mr. Hefner?

20 A Hugh Hefner, the owner of Playboy Magazine. 21 Q Was that someone known for wearing pajamas out in 22 public? 23 A It was sort of his signature uniform. He wore satin 24 pajamas all the time.

25 Q What did Mr. Trump do when you said that?

14 Q What -- did you notice what he was wearing at the time 15 when he came to greet you?

2589

1 A I told him to go change, and he obliged very politely.

2 Q Did he come back at some point in a different outfit?
3 A Yes. 4 Q What was he wearing?

5 A Just a dress shirt and dress pants. 6 Q And what were you doing when he went to go change?

7 A Just kind of walking around, looking around the 8 suite -- it actually was very quick, how fast he changed. 9 It was a very big suite.

10 You know, when you say hotel room, people often think 11 of a hotel room that we are used to and when you walk in there 12 is a bed, a dresser, and that's the connotation that people 13 have in their head when you say a hotel room. 14 This hotel room was three times the size of my 15 apartment. 16 Q What sort of rooms did you see in the hotel room?

17 A You walked in and --
18 Q My apologies. 19 What did you see in the suite?

20 A Suite. So you walked in this foyer that had a 21 gigantic flower arrangement, as I said, and then you go into a 22 living room area. That was also bigger than the living room in 23 my first three houses, and it was carpet. And like I said, a 24 full-size couch and chair and TV, and over to the left was a 25 like a -- like a bar thing, I guess.

1 And then a -- like another little room that had a 2590 5 It was all heavy, beautiful furniture. There was 11 that point?

14 Q Did you both sit down at that dining room table?

15 A Yes.

23 A It was a little bit early. I do remember it wasn't 24 even dark outside just yet. It was still some light coming 25 through the windows.

12 A To the table, I guess the dining room table. The 13 table with the chairs would be where you would have dinner.

16 Q Where was he sitting and where were you sitting?

17 A He was sitting across from me with his back against 18 the wall, and the buffet/credenza was behind him. And I was 19 sitting directly across from him in the main area, the living 20 room bar area, behind me. 21 Q And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say about talking 22 a while before dinner?

6 another room over that way -- I didn't go into that room. It 7 was a very big beautiful room. It was nicer than any of my 8 friends' apartments. 9 Q When Mr. Trump came back in the suit -- you said he 10 went to put on a dress shirt. Where did the two of you go at 2 table and chairs. It was almost a full-size dining room table 3 with a full-size -- some people call it a buffet, some people 4 call it a credenza, depending on where you are from.

2591 1 And he said, you know, it was a bit early, would you 2 mind like just talking for a bit and get to know each other, 3 and then we can go down or we can stay up or whatever. 4 I said, yes, absolutely. So I took a seat and we 5 started talking. 6 Q So, what were some of the things that you discussed 7 with him?

8 First, I am going to ask you, did you talk to him 9 about how you grew up?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Tell the jury a little bit about that.

12 A Yeah. I mean, it's getting to know you. It's 13 pleasantries. 14 Where are you from? 15 What's your family like? 16 Just all of the entry conversation kind of stuff. I
17 told him where I was from.

19 He asked me -- he asked me about my family. All of 20 those things. 21 Where I went to school.

22 Did I go to college?

23 Where did I live at that time? 24 Did I have any children? I did not. 25 Was I married? I wasn't then. 18 I told him, you know, where I grew up.

2592 1 Did I have a boyfriend? No, I didn't at the time.

2 Just things that I like to do. Generally, get to know 3 you sort of things. 4 And then -- and I don't remember the exact order of 5 everything we discussed, I just remember the conversations. 6 Q Let me just ask a follow-up question.

10 Q That it was a difficult time growing up? 11 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

19 Q Tell the jury a little bit about that.

20 A He asked how I got involved in the adult entertainment 21 business.

22 I told him that story about how I started dancing and 23 posing for magazines. He was very interested in how I would 24 segue from being a porn star to writing and directing.

25 I did have to immediately lay that misconception that 7 Did you talk to him at all about the conditions of 8 your childhood? 9 A Yes. Absolutely.

12 A Yes. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 MS. NECHELES: Move to strike.

15 THE COURT: That answer is stricken. 16 Q I am moving on to another question.

17 Did he also ask about your work?

18 A Yes.

2593 1 so many have that, yes, some adult films have real scripts and 2 are real movies, not just, oh, I am sorry, Mr. Pizza Boy, which 3 is very offensive to me. 4 So, I did explain to him like different types of adult 5 films, some are scripted. Some budgets are $5,000 and some 6 budgets are $250. I explained that there is such a budget 7 range and how I got involved in it. 8 He was very interested in a lot of the business 9 aspects of it, which I thought was very cool.

10 He asked questions like, are there any unions? 11 Do you get residuals?

12 How are the people paid? 13 Do you get health insurance? 14 What about testing?

15 Are you worried about STD's?

17 You know, most of the time, I am trying to be very 18 careful and not say bad words. Most of the people who want to 19 talk to me about work, they want to know the sexy stuff, or the 20 dirty stuff. 21 What's your favorite position?

22 They want to know the salacious things. 23 These were more very thought-out business questions. 24 I can't tell you if I ever remember someone asking do we have a 25 union and how we get paid and how the testing works in the 16 Do they have a doctor on staff?

2594 1 industry, are we worried about getting pregnant or catching 2 something. 3 So it was a lot of that conversation. 4 Q Did he ask about whether you had ever been tested? 7 every 14 days. You cannot work unless you have a test. 8 And yes, you know, have you ever had a bad test? 9 A bad test is something positive for something.

10 I said, nope. I can show you my entire record. 11 Anybody in the industry can see anybody's testing.

12 You sort of waive that privilege. 13 But, yes, I have every test that I have ever done for 14 the last X amount of years. At the time it was a month, now 15 it's twice a month. 16 I never had a bad test. I never tested positive for 17 anything.

18 Q Did you talk to him at all about protection, safety? 19 A Yes, a little bit. And I think that's kind of how we 20 segued into the safety conversation. 21 He said, aren't you worried about safety?

22 And I was quick to point out that my time in the 23 industry I chose to work for Wicked Pictures because they are 24 the only condom mandatory company.

25 Q What does that mean?

5 A Yes, of course. I volunteered it as well. At the 6 time you -- you will to be tested every 30 days. Today it's 2595 8 Q Is that one of the reasons that you worked there? 9 A Yes. Even when I worked with my husband, I had to use 10 a condom, even though I am allergic to latex. Latex, that type 11 of thing.

12 So, we were talking about that and stuff like that. 13 So, I was like, you know, adult performers are kind of like --
16 Q What did he tell you about that?

17 A He said that he was friends with the owner of the 18 company. I don't know if it was Vince McMahon. 19 And I had seen the thing on there about he does 20 stunts, like a guest spot, not really wrestling on WWE. 21 THE COURT: Ms. Daniels, if you can just slow 22 down a little bit so that the court reporter can get what 23 you are saying. 24 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
25 Q Did he tell you anything about the scripts with 14 I said, like WWE, like wrestling, because I really wanted to 15 ask him about him making --
1 A Which means that even when I was working -- even if a 2 married couple was working together, even if you were going to 3 work with your spouse, for a husband and wife, you live 4 together, when you perform on camera for Wicked Pictures, you 5 have to use a condom. 6 They are the only condom-mandatory company in the 7 adult business.

2596 1 respect to his being in the wrestling with Vince McMahon?

2 A Oh, yeah, I made him. 3 The little scenario or plot that he was a part of at 4 the time was some sort of, I don't remember if it was a bet or 5 whatever, but the point was that if he lost that he had to 6 shave his head or Vince McMahon got to shave his head.

7 And Donald Trump has always been famous for his do. 8 And so, I said, well, what are you going to do if you 9 lose? You do not have the head design to be without hair.

10 Some of us look good bald, some of us don't. I don't think you 11 are that man.

16 advance.

19 A Yes. Very brief.

20 Q Did this occur in the context of you viewing a picture 21 that included his wife?

22 A Yes. He showed me a few pictures of things. 23 And I said, oh, what about your wife? 24 Q What did he say?

25 A I actually said, she is very beautiful. What about 14 And, you know, I remember he used the word, setup, but 15 it's predetermined in the script that we know the outcome in 12 And he said, oh, no. No. No. I agree with you. All 13 of that stuff is predetermined. 17 Q Let me ask you, at some point was there a very brief 18 discussion about his wife, Melania?

2597 1 your wife?

2 He said, oh, don't worry about that. We are -- 3 actually don't even sleep in the same room. 4 Q Did there come a time during the discussion with him 5 that he discussed being on the cover of some of his magazines? 6 A Of course.

7 Q Tell us about that. 8 A He would ask me questions and then not let me finish 10 He kept cutting me off, and it was almost like he 13 He just wanted to talk about himself. And he said, 14 have you seen my new magazines? Well, of course you couldn't 15 have seen it. I have a copy. 16 So he pulled out a magazine, I don't know if it was 17 not released yet or just released, that he was on the cover of.

18 It was not like I made a habit of reading financial magazines. 19 I was just a 27-year-old stripper, but, yeah.

20 Q And what happened with respect to that discussion 21 about magazines?

22 A At this point, I pretty much had enough of his 23 arrogance and cutting me off and still not getting my dinner. 24 So, I decided someone should take him on.

25 So I said, are you always this rude, arrogant and 11 wanted to one-up me, which was just really hilarious when you 12 think about it.

9 the answer.

2598 1 pompous? You don't even know how to have a conversion, and I
2 was pretty nasty. I snapped. 3 And he seemed to be taken aback. 4 And I said, someone should spank you with that.

5 That's the only interest I have in that magazine. Otherwise, I 6 am leaving.

7 Q What happened? 8 A I don't think he thought I would do it. 9 So, he rolled it up and gave me the look that he dared 10 me to do it. So, now I kind of had to. 11 Q So, what did you do?

12 A So, I took it from him and said, turn around. And I 13 swatted him. 14 Q Where do you swat him?

15 A Right on the butt. 16 Q Right after that, did you continue to sit down and 17 talk?

18 A Yes. And he was much more polite. 19 Q Did you have a discussion with him about The 20 Apprentice? 21 A Yes. I think, like I said, we talked about numerous 22 things. We talked about the golf course in Scotland, which to 23 me was very interesting about the environment that was there. 24 We talked about travel.

25 Like I said, there was nothing weird about the 2599 20 well. And the way he framed it did actually make perfect 21 sense, because he is all about like PR things, the spin. And 22 he was like, that will really shake things up, and you can go 23 on the show and prove that you are not just a dumb bimbo, you 24 are more than people think and he would get a lot of attention 25 for having this crazy idea.

1 conversations except that it wasn't weird, it was like business 2 questions and thought-out questions and thought-out answers, 3 and how did you come up with ideas for my scripts and things 4 like that.

5 And it was at that point he got really quiet, and he 6 was thinking, and he told me he had an idea, that I should go 7 on his television show. 8 Q Which show? 9 A The Apprentice.

10 Q Was it The Apprentice? 11 A I don't remember the TV show. The Apprentice, I
13 Apprentice. 12 assume it's Celebrity Apprentice. I don't know, The 14 And I said there is no way that they would ever let --
15 there is no way NBC would ever let an adult actress on 16 television. And I said, even you don't have that much power.

17 And he said that he did.

18 He said, you remind me of my daughter because she is 19 smart and blond and beautiful and people under estimate her as 2600 1 Q Did he say anything else about The Apprentice and what 2 might happen if you went on? 3 A Right. 4 And so, I was -- first of all, there is no way that's 5 going to happen. I knew enough about his ego to know even you 6 don't have that much power, thinking that would also make him 7 want to do it. 8 I was like, people underestimate women, especially 9 people in the adult industry, when they see blond hair and big 10 boobs, and I am a good writer and director. 11 And he said, this is your chance to have somebody see 12 that part of you. 13 I was like, well, but I am not a business person. I 14 don't have that kind of education. Like, there is no way I
15 could win. What, if, you know -- 16 He said, you don't have to win. You just have to show 17 who you are.

18 I said, what if I lose on the first episode? That 19 also makes me look bad. People will take that and run with it.

20 You are just an idiot like we all thought you were. 21 And then he said, what if I tell you what the 22 challenges are? 23 Q What did you understand that to mean? 24 A He said, you know, we can kind of like on the 25 wrestling thing, if you know what they are, obviously, I can't 2601 1 have you win, but we can -- I am in control. I know what's 2 going to happen. I can give you some advantage to make sure 3 you at least make a good showing. 4 I said, all right. We will see if I can make that 5 happen. 6 Q Did he suggest that if you did get on The Apprentice 7 what might happen with other aspects of your career? 8 A Just that people might be able to take me serious, 9 know that I wasn't just an airhead. That I could finally -- he 10 knew and we talked essentially about what I really wanted to 11 do, and that is to be taken seriously as a writer and director.

12 And at the time I hadn't done any mainstream writing 13 or directing, and that's still what I wanted to do. 14 I wanted to write and direct film and music videos 15 things like that. Nothing against the adult entertainment 16 business. I have no shame. That's who I am, but I also wanted 17 to direct other bigger things. They have bigger budgets and 18 better catering. 19 And he was like, this is your chance for somebody to 20 see you and maybe give you that kind of opportunity. So, he 21 pushed it as a win/win.

22 Q Did he ask you about any of the other people that you 23 worked with at Wicked Pictures? 24 A Of course. He asked me multiple times in the 25 conversation, like, who are you? You know, is everybody in the 1 industry friends?

2 Do you all hate each other? 3 Do you love each other? 4 Do you hook up off camera?

5 I don't want to use the word, hook up. 6 Do you sleep with each other off camera?

7 Do you have any friends here? 8 Well, the girls from Wicked were there. 9 And he said, what about your friends here from Wicked?

10 Of course I shot that down immediately because the 11 whole reason I was having dinner there is because I didn't want 12 to have dinner with one of them. 13 Q Did you call another colleague of yours during this 14 conversation from Wicked?

15 A No, I didn't. 16 Q Not from Wicked. I apologize.

17 Did you call another friend of yours?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Tell us about that.

20 A Yes. I bumped into a friend of mine that was in town. 21 She was actually one of my neighbors as well. I had no idea 22 that she was in Lake Tahoe. She was not there for the golf 23 tournament. 24 I literally walked into her while I was walking down 25 the street with another girl from the industry getting a tattoo 2602 2603 1 at a tattoo parlor.

2 And as I was walking, she called my name. Her name is 3 Alana. And she is who I bumped into on my way over there and 4 the one I told I was on my way to see him. And I know she 5 didn't believe me. So when he was like, do you know anybody 6 else? I also had two reasons for calling Alana. One because I
7 am telling the truth. I am with Donald Trump. And, two, he 10 Q Did you end up calling your friend Alana from the 11 hotel room?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Did you put her on speaker? 14 A Yeah.

15 Q What, if any, conversation did you and Mr. Trump have 16 with Alana on speaker?

17 A He said, hello, which meant that I won that bet.

18 I know she didn't believe me, and they talked. 19 And she said, what are you guys doing?

20 And he said, we are just hanging out. Why don't you 21 come over and hang out with us?

22 And she, I can't remember what kind of excuse she 23 made. 24 She said, yeah, I will call you back in a little bit 25 or whatever. She didn't. Time just kept going by.

8 asked me to call one of my friends and I didn't want to call my 9 colleague from Wicked.

1 I called her and nothing. We didn't get a good -- I
2 called her a few more times and it went to voicemail. 3 Q When you called her and had her on speaker phone, did 4 Mr. Trump ask her to come over and join you as well?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Approximately, how long in total were you talking in 7 the suite with Mr. Trump, sitting, as you said, in the dining 8 room-type area? 9 A Well, close to two hours. It was a long time.

10 Q Now, at that point, meaning after all of that 14 Q At some point did you need to use the restroom?

15 A Yes. 16 Q And did you tell --
17 THE COURT: Is this a good time to take a break?

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, it is, Judge. 19 THE COURT: Let's take our morning recess.

20 Please remember all of my instructions as you 21 step out.

23 (Whereupon, the jurors are excused.)
25 You can step down.

2604 24 THE COURT: Please be seated.

11 discussion that you just described, did you sense any red flags 12 or reason that you where concerned about being there? 13 A No.

22 COURT OFFICER: All rise.

2605 1 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
2 THE COURT: Please approach. 3 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 4 record.)
5 THE COURT: I understand that your client is 6 upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is 7 shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous.

21 And, later, I think he was looking at you, 22 Mr. Blanche, later when we were talking about The 23 Apprentice, at that point he again uttered a vulgarity and 24 looked at you this time.

25 Please talk to him at the break.

8 It has the potential to intimidate the witness 9 and the jury can see that.

10 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him. 11 THE COURT: So, I am speaking to you here at the 12 bench because I don't want to embarrass him. 13 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him. 14 THE COURT: You need to speak to him. I won't 15 tolerate that. 16 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him.

17 THE COURT: One time I noticed when Ms. Daniels 18 was testifying about rolling up the magazine, and 19 presumably smacking your client, and after that point he 20 shook his head and he looked down.

21 THE SERGEANT: All rise. Jury entering.

2608 1 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor. 3 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 4 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 5 Q. Now, before we broke, Ms. Daniels, we were talking 6 about the discussions you had in the hotel suite. Did there 7 come a time that you needed to use the restroom? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. Can you tell us just about that?

10 A. I had been there for quite a while, I drank a couple of 11 bottles of water, which is all we were drinking. It was water. 12 And I needed to use the ladies room. So I asked if that was 13 possible. So I was instructed to go through the living room and 14 to the bedroom and to help myself to the facilities. 15 Q. When you say you were directed, who directed you? 16 A. Mr. Trump. 17 Q. Can you describe -- you said you went through a bedroom 18 to get to the bathroom? 19 A. Yes. I went out of the dining room area, through the 20 living room, through a bedroom, into what I assume is the master 21 bedroom. It was a very large, beautiful bathroom. 22 Q. What did you see inside the bathroom? 23 A. So I walked through the bedroom. I did notice that the 24 bed was unmade, but there were no personal items around. And I 25 entered the bathroom. I went into the separate area where the 2609 1 toilet actually was and used the bathroom, came out, and was 2 washing my hands and touching up my lipstick. I did notice 3 someone had obviously been using the restroom. There were 20 Q. Did you try to call her while you were inside the 21 bathroom?

22 A. I believe so. Her phone was going straight to 23 voicemail. At this point she wanted no part of whatever I had 24 going on.

25 Q. What happened when you left the bathroom?

4 towels and stuff that was open. There was a leather, or like a 5 leather looking toiletry bag on the counter with products and 6 stuff in it, which, you know --
7 Q. What do you remember about what was inside? 8 A. I did look. I'm not proud of it. I wondered what is 9 in here. And I noticed the toiletry was -- the items were Old 10 Spice and Pert Plus. I thought that was both amusing and odd. 11 And a manicure set, which was gold, gold tweezers and all gold 12 things. 13 I finished washing my hands and touched my makeup up. 14 Then I walked out of the bathroom.

15 Q. Did you try to call anybody while you were inside the 16 bathroom? Al anaAlina was not answering her phone. In fact, I
17 wish I had a cell phone camera. If I did, I definitely would 18 have taken a picture of that. I even thought, woe, this is 19 crazy.

2610 1 A. When I came out of the bathroom, I expected to exit, go 2 around the bed and back out to where we had been sitting and 3 talking and hopefully say; Okay, time to go, I have been here 4 for a long time. 5 That was actually when I realized how long I had been 6 there. 7 And when I opened the bathroom door to come out, 8 Mr. Trump had come into the bedroom and was on the bed, 9 basically between myself and the exit.

10 Q. What was he wearing at the time? 11 A. His boxer shorts and t-shirt. 12 Q. What was your reaction to seeing him like that? 13 A. At first, I was just startled, like jump scare. I 14 wasn't expecting someone to be there, especially minus a lot of 15 clothing. That's when I had that moment where I felt the room 16 spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands 17 and my feet and almost like if you stand up too fast, and 18 everything kind of spinned, that happened too. 19 Then I just thought, oh, my God, what did I misread to 20 get here. Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody 21 stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like 22 waiting for you. 23 Q. What happened when you came out of the bathroom, did he 24 stay on the bed? 25 A. When I exited, he was just up on the bed like this 2611 1 (indicating).

2 Q. What happened after that? 3 A. And I went to step around. I laughed nervously, and, 4 you know, tried to make a joke out of it, and step around and 5 leave. Even though I was moving like I was in a funhouse, like 6 slow motion. 7 I thought to myself; Great. I put myself in this bad 8 situation, like what did I do, how did I misread everything. 9 He stood up between me and the door, not in a 10 threatening manner. He didn't come at me. He didn't rush at 11 me. He didn't put his hands on me and nothing like that. 12 I said, I got to go. 13 He said, I thought we were getting somewhere, we were 14 talking, and I thought you were serious about what you wanted. 15 If you ever want to get out of that trailer park -- basically, I 16 was offended because I never lived in a trailer park. 17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Move along. 19 THE WITNESS: I am sorry, Judge. I don't 20 understand. 21 THE COURT: The objection is sustained. 22 Q. You were both standing up at this time? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. And what happened next, briefly? 25 A. I just think I blacked out. I was not drugged. I
2612 1 never insinuated that I was on drugs. I was not drunk. I never 2 said anything of that sort. I just don't remember -- 3 MS. NECHELES: I object. 4 THE COURT: Overruled. 5 Q. Did you at some point -- 6 THE COURT: Please approach. 7 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:) 8 THE COURT: Tell me what your objection is? 9 MS. NECHELES: She is making it sound like she was 10 drugged. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: She said she wasn't drugged. 12 MS. NECHELES: She said she is dizzy, she blacked 13 out. 14 THE COURT: I got the impression she was saying 15 she wasn't drugged. She is not suggesting she was drugged. 16 I sustained your objection. 17 If you want -- I got the impression -- Do you want 18 to consult with the other lawyers. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: I can clarify, if you would like. 20 MS. NECHELES: I think it should be clarified. 21 She is not saying she was not. 22 MS. HOFFINGER: Sure, I can do that. 24 open court:) 25 THE COURT: The objection is sustained. 23 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in 2613 1 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
2 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 3 Q. I want to clarify and ask you to slow down so the 4 reporter can understand you. 5 Were you saying you were not drugged in any way; is 6 that correct? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. You had not had any alcohol in any way? 9 A. Correct.

10 Q. Okay. 11 And that's what you were trying to convey? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. So, he was standing up and you were standing up. What 14 were your relative heights? 15 A. I am 5'6", 5'7", and I don't know how tall he was, 16 definitely several inches taller and much larger. 17 Q. But you said you didn't feel threatened; is that right?

18 MS. NECHELES: Objection, leading. 20 Q. Did you feel threatened by him? 21 A. No, not physically. Although, I did note there was a 22 bodyguard right outside the door. There was an imbalance of 23 power for sure. He was bigger and blocking the way. But, I 24 mean, I was not threatened verbally or physically. 25 Q. Can you briefly describe, at some point, did you end up 19 THE COURT: Sustained.

2614 1 on the bed having sex?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. Can you very briefly describe where you had sex with 4 him? 8 on. We were in the missionary position.

11 Q. Without describing the position, do you remember how 9 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

10 THE COURT: Sustained. 12 your clothes got off? 13 A. No. 14 Q. Is that a memory that has not come back to you? 15 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained. 17 Q. You don't at this point remember; is that correct?

18 A. Correct. 19 Q. And did you end up having sex with him on the bed? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. And do you know -- withdrawn. 22 Do you have a recollection of feeling something unusual 23 that you have a memory of? 24 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 25 THE COURT: Sustained.

5 A. The next thing I know, I was on the bed, somehow on the 6 opposite side of the bed from where we had been standing. I had 7 my clothes and shoes off. I believe my bra, however, was still 2615 1 Q. What, if anything -- do you remember anything other 2 than the fact that you had sex on the bed? 3 A. I was staring at the ceiling. I didn't know how I got 4 there. I made note, like I was trying to think about anything 5 other than what was happening there.

10 Q. Did you touch his skin? 11 A. Yes.

12 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. Sustained. 14 Q. Was he wearing a condom?

15 A. No. 16 Q. Was that concerning to you?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Did you say anything about it? 19 A. No.

20 Q. Why not? 21 A. I didn't say anything at all.

22 Q. Do you recall how it ended, the sex? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. Was it brief?

25 A. Yes.

9 THE COURT: The answer is stricken. 7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 MS. NECHELES: I move to strike.

6 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

2616

1 Q. Do you remember at some point getting dressed?
2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And tell us what you recall about getting dressed? 4 A. Sitting on end of the bed, noticing that it was 5 completely dark outside now, and that it was -- it was really 6 hard to get my shoes on, my hands were shaking so hard. I had 7 on tiny little -- they was strappy gold heels with little tiny 8 buckles. My hands were shaking so hard. I was having a hard 9 time getting dressed. He said, "Oh, great. Let's get together 10 again honey bunch. We were great together." I just wanted to 11 leave. 12 Q. Did you say no at any time during sex with him? 13 A. No. 14 Q. Why not? 15 A. Because I didn't say anything at all. 16 Q. Did you notice afterwards a DVD on the side table? 17 A. Yes. The DVD I had given him earlier in the gift bag 18 from the show was on the nightstand, that I signed. 19 Q. When you were leaving and you went to leave, what, if 20 anything, did you do or say? 21 A. He said, "We have to get together again soon." He went 22 to kiss me goodbye. I just left as fast as I could. You know, 23 that was it. 24 Q. Did he say anything to you about talking again? 25 A. Yes. He said, "We should get together again. We were 2617 1 fantastic together. I want to get you on the show." And that 2 was it. He didn't give me anything. He didn't offer to pay me 3 or anything or a cell phone number or anything like that. 4 Q. Did he ask you to keep your encounter with him 5 confidential? 6 A. No. 7 Q. Did he express any concern at that point about his wife 8 finding out? 9 A. No.

10 Q. Did you end up having dinner in his room that night? 11 A. No. 12 Q. You said it was dark out when you left? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. And do you recall how you got back to your hotel? 16 Q. After that night, did you tell anybody else about what 17 happened?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. Just give us a sense of the people that you told and 20 what you told them? 21 A. I told very few people that we had actually had sex 22 because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say 23 no. A lot of people would just assume -- they would make jokes 24 out of it. I didn't think it was funny. I didn't want to hear 25 about it, or assume that I was paid prostitute, which I wasn't.

15 A. It was a cab.

2618 1 So I told very few people. I also didn't want it to get back to 2 anybody that I was dating. 3 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 4 THE COURT: Sustained. 5 Q. There are some details that you said you still don't 6 remember? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Did there come a time some years after the encounter 9 with Mr. Trump that you remembered some additional details about 10 what happened that you hadn't remembered earlier? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Can you tell the jury about that? 13 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 14 THE COURT: Overruled. 15 A. So most of everything I said I have said consistently, 16 every interview in the book. 17 Q. Just to direct you, were there certain things that you 18 always remembered -- 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. -- about what happened in the room? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. You always remembered that you had sex with him, for 23 example? 24 A. Yes. 25 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

2619 1 THE COURT: Please approach.

2 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:) 3 THE COURT: Your objection is to leading? 4 MS. NECHELES: The objection to leading, but I 5 am also objecting to the witness just going off on 6 tangents. 7 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger is doing some leading. 8 I will sustain your objection as to leading. 9 But I think that is what Ms. Hoffinger is trying 10 to do, she is trying to direct her. I think that might be 11 the safer course. 12 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I understand that. The 13 problem is, that she is also leading her through a set of 14 things: What do you remember? 15 And, so -- and obviously the problem with leading, 16 it suggests answers sometimes. 17 So I understand that -- maybe if your Honor could 18 direct the witness to just answer the questions. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: I think that she has answered my 20 questions. I think asking her to answer my questions is 21 not necessarily probative. 22 But I would say, I have been leading her to try to 23 be cognizant of the Judge's decision. I have had a 24 chance to talk to her about it. I was trying to lead her. 25 Second, Ms. Necheles has made very clear her story 2620 1 has changed and is going to. So I need to elicit there 2 were certain things she always remembered, but she did have 3 an experience in 2019 when she saw the movie Bombshell 4 that caused her to remember some additional details. That 5 is what I am trying to bring out. 6 THE COURT: What was the Bombshell? 7 MS. HOFFINGER: It was a movie about Roger Ailes. 8 That is how she remembered what he said to her when she 9 came out of the bathroom, which was about the trailer park.

10 MS. NECHLES: She did mention trailer park, and 11 that's why I objected. That is not necessary. 12 THE COURT: Sure. 13 We need some finality in this case. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. I will try to direct her a 15 little bit around that. I don't need to ask the last 16 question, which was, were there things you always 17 remembered, which I can go straight to the Bombshell 18 movie, what happened, how she remembers additional 19 details. 20 MS. NECHELES: It goes to the thing that she said 21 about the trailer park, I have to cross-examine her. 22 But we believe that this has now introduced -- 23 and what the prosecution is going to do is introduce even 24 more this whole theory of inappropriate power being used, 25 and when she said it was undue influence being used, an 2621 1 imbalance.

2 THE COURT: I think we need to stay the course. 3 Avoid anything that is going to get us into trouble. 4 I will let you ask the question again. If she 5 doesn't answer directly, I will ask her to answer the 6 question. 7 MS. NECHELES: The Bombshell stuff? 8 THE COURT: Not coming in. 9 MS. HOFFINGER: You want me to not ask the 10 question? 11 THE COURT: Don't ask it. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: Can I on redirect, if they 13 question on cross? 16 open court:) 17 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
18 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 19 Q. Ms. Daniels, did you see Mr. Trump again in Tahoe the 20 next day? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Tell the jury about that. 23 A. The next day I met him, this time at my hotel, at a 24 nightclub restaurant bar downstairs. 25 Q. What was going on in your hotel that night?

15 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in 14 THE COURT: Yes.

2622 1 A. It was all part of the same event, the charity event.

2 They did a silent auction. They had cocktails, however, 3 whatever. I met him at one of the nightclubs there. 4 Q. So that was part of your participating in the things 5 that Wicked was doing for this golf tournament? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. You met him there. Where was it? Did you say it was 8 in the lobby? 9 A. The nightclub, a bar, like in the lobby of the hotel.

10 It was a nightclub. 11 Q. Did anyone call you before going there to indicate that 12 Mr. Trump was going to be there? 13 A. Yes. Keith said he wanted to talk to me again, would I 14 be willing to meet him. This time it was in public. I said, 15 yes. 16 And when I arrived, he was sitting at a booth in a 17 nightclub. It was dark. There was loud music, drinking. He 18 wasn't drinking, but it was a bar. He was with his friend and 19 bodyguard. 20 Q. And when you say "his friend," do you know who his 21 friend was? 22 A. Ben Roethlisberger from the Pittsburgh Steelers. 23 Q. Did Mr. Trump say hello to you and introduce you? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. What did he say?

2623 1 A. He introduced me as his little friend Stormy to Big 2 Ben, the football player, and we sat down. I remember it 3 clearly because I talked Ben into letting me try on his 4 Superbowl ring and two of my fingers fit into it. 5 Q. When you say "Big Ben," is that how Mr. Trump referred 6 to Mr. Roethlisberger? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. What, if anything, did you discuss at the table with 9 Mr. Trump or Mr. Roethlisberger?

10 A. It was really loud. I mean, it was very, very brief. 11 They were talking. I think they had been having a conversation 12 when I arrived. They kind of continued it out of earshot. They 13 were whispering to each other. 14 Then he said -- he did come back to me: Hey, 15 everything about our idea, I think it's good. I got to get back 16 home and figure out how to get you on the show. 17 He took a call. He was very busy.

18 He left and said: "You know, I am going to have Ben 19 walk you back to your room," and, "Ben, would you mind seeing 20 her up?" 21 It was very, very short. Maybe ten minutes that I was 22 there. 23 Q. And Ben walked you up to your room? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Did you leave Lake Tahoe the next day?

2624 1 A. I believe it was the next day, yes.

2 Q. And do you recall the first person you did tell about 3 having that sexual encounter with Mr. Trump? 4 A. I think Keith. Not the same Keith. Keith, my friend. 5 I rented his house. He was one of my best friends. He was like 6 my dad. And my makeup artist, Christine. 7 Q. Did you tell either of them all the details of what 8 occurred in the room or just some of them? 9 A. Most of them.

10 Q. And were there others that you told about some of it? 11 A. Sure. 12 Q. Did you tell those folks, did you tell them all of what 13 happened? 14 A. There were several people that I told. I told lots and 15 lots of people that I had told that I had gone to his room and 16 that I had met him. It wasn't a secret at all. I told scores 17 of people that.

18 The sex part, I told very few very close people, like 19 Kieth, who was photographer/best friend/family, and my makeup 20 artist, who is my very best friend and confidante. Her name is 21 Christine. And my assistant at the time. My assistant, her 22 name is Yoli. 23 Q. Did Mr. Trump call you after that encounter in July of 24 2006 in Tahoe? 25 A. Yes.

2625 1 Q. Tell us about that, how often he would call you?

8 people heard me on the phone with him. It was not a secret. 9 My entire crew and cast, especially my cameraman and makeup 10 artist. 11 He always definitely loaded the call with an update or 12 a non-update, if he didn't have one, for The Apprentice, and 13 always talked about when we could get together again. Did I 14 miss him? He always called me honey bunch. And when was I 15 going to be in New York. Did I need anything? He was working 16 on the The Apprentice thing. He would say, I didn't have a 17 chance to talk to him.

18 Q. When you put him on speakerphone, did you tell him he 19 was on speaker? 20 A. No. 21 Q. Did he ever tell you during those calls that you should 22 keep it confidential and not tell anyone?

23 A. No.
24 Q. Why did you continue to take his calls? 25 A. Because I did tell my publicist, Mike, about The 6 whatever. I always put him on speakerphone. We thought it was 7 funny. I put him on speakerphone and dozens and dozens of 2 A. He would call on average once a week. Sometimes two or 3 three times a week. Sometimes not at all for three weeks. He 4 would always call. I was working a lot at the time. I was 5 shooting a lot, I was directing photo shoots for magazines or 2626 1 Apprentice thing. He took great pride in telling me he told 2 me to go to that dinner -- 3 THE COURT: Ms. Daniels, listen to the question 4 and answer the question. 5 A. -- to go and meet him was good. 6 Q. Why did you continue to take his calls? 7 A. My publicist thought it was good to continue my 8 conversations with him about the television show. 9 Q. At some point, did Mr. Trump give you his work number?

10 A. He gave me his assistant's number. 11 Q. And did he give that to you over the phone or in 12 person? 13 A. Over the phone. 14 Q. And what did he tell you about that number that he gave 15 you? 16 A. That it was a person who worked closest with him. 17 She -- her name was Rhona. I remember writing it down on the 18 notepad in my house while I was on the phone. If I ever need to 19 get a hold of him, she would know how. 20 Q. Do you remember, approximately, when he gave you that 22 A. I know where I was at, what house I was living in. I 23 know it was late Summer of 2006. 24 Q. And what did you do with the number when he gave it to 25 you? 21 phone number?

1 A. I wrote it down on a piece of paper next to my bed and 2 I entered it into the phone. 3 Q. When you say you "entered it into your phone," did you 4 put it into your phone contacts?

5 A. Yes. Sorry. 6 Q. That's all right.

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show now just to the 10 Q. Do you recognize that, Ms. Daniels? 11 A. Yes.

12 Q. What do you recognize that to be? 13 A. That is a picture of Rhona's contact in my phone. 14 Q. And do you notice that the phone number is redacted to 15 show only the last four digits of the number?

17 Q. Had you reviewed it and compared it to the original 18 contact without that redaction? 19 A. Yes.

20 Q. Are they exactly the same other than the redaction? 21 A. Yes.

22 Q. Other than the redaction, is that an exact copy of the 23 contact that you entered into your phone for Rhona when you 24 received it from Mr. Trump sometime in 2006?

25 A. Yes, it is.

2627 8 witness to the Court and the parties People's Exhibit 228A 9 for identification.

16 A. Yes.

2628 1 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer People's Exhibit 228A into 2 evidence. 3 THE COURT: Any objection? 4 MS. NECHELES: No objection. 5 THE COURT: 228A is accepted into evidence. 6 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 228A was received 7 into evidence.) 8 (Displayed.) 9 Q. What did the contact read at the time?

10 A. The name? 11 Q. Yes. 12 A. "D. Trump Rona." 13 Q. And why did you enter it that way, "D. Trump Rona?" 14 A. Well, I didn't want to type Donald Trump, so I put in 15 Rona. The same thing, I didn't know her last name. So it's 16 kind of like the Keith one, it's how I remember it, what it was 17 for, and if I needed to get a hold of him. That's why his 18 name was first. I needed to get a hold of a woman named Rhona. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take it down. 20 Now, please, show what is in evidence as People's 21 Exhibit 83. 22 Actually, you can show it on all the screens. 23 Thank you. 24 Maybe we can blow it up. 25 (Displayed.)

5 number there?

For the same reason, I wanted to maintain that sort of 7 relationship because the celebrity -- the chance to be on the 8 The Apprentice was still up in the air and it would have been a 9 great thing. It would have been great for my career, especially 10 when it was framed as being a writer and director. It was a 11 public event. 12 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 MS. NECHELES: Move to strike. 15 THE COURT: Ms. Daniels, please keep the answer 16 short. Listen to the question and answer the question. 17 The objection is overruled.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. 19 Q. Did you go alone or with others? 20 A. I went with two friends. 21 Q. What were the first names of the two friends that went 22 with you? 23 A. Just first names? 24 Q. Yes. 25 A. Tara and Evan.

10 Q. And did he ask you to see him again? 11 A. Yes. He spent most of the time talking to my friend. 12 Every time I came over, he asked me if I would go back with him 13 that night. 14 Q. What did you tell him? 15 A. I lied to him and said that my friend -- I lied to him 16 and said we were flying out on a girls trip out of LAX that 17 night.

18 Q. Let me direct your attention to a few months later, 19 about March of 2007. Did you visit with Mr. Trump at Trump 20 Tower at about that time? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. How did that come about? 23 A. He said if I was ever in New York that I should stop by 24 and we should get together, I should see Trump Tower, we could 25 have a meeting about the show.

2633 1 I was here on unrelated business, I was working, I was 2 dancing at a club, and I hit him up. I thought it would be 3 great if I could get him to come to the club and see me, but he, 4 instead, invited me to his office building. 5 And the same thing, I reached out to Rhona as 6 instructed, and my assistant and I went to Trump Tower to meet 7 with him. 8 Q. You said you asked him to come to the show where you 9 were going to be performing?

10 A. Right. 11 Q. Why did do you that? 12 A. It was a public place. Lots of witnesses. 13 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 14 THE COURT: Sustained. 15 Q. Was there a reason you thought it would be good for the 16 club if he showed up? 17 A. It would be good for the club and safer.

18 MS. NECHELES: Objection, and move to strike. 19 THE COURT: Sustained. 20 The answer is stricken. 21 Q. What happened when you got to Trump Tower? 22 A. Like when I walked in? 23 Q. Yes. 24 A. I was greeted warmly. I was expected. They were 25 expecting me. And I went up to his office to greet him, my 2634 1 assistant and I, she was with me.

2 Q. Did you meet his assistant, Rhona, in the reception 3 area upstairs? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And were you ushered into his office with your 6 assistant? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And did you have a discussion in there with Mr. Trump? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And, just generally, what was the discussion? 11 A. It was very brief. He was very busy. People were in 12 and out. He introduced me to a couple of other people when I 13 was there, and he was in a meeting with somebody when I got 17 office. We took selfies. He said: "I don't have a lot of 18 time. I wanted you to stop by. I wanted to say hi." 19 It was always: "I am still working on the The 20 Apprentice thing," it got pushed back, I got it; that kind of 21 thing. It was always very, very brief. 22 Q. Did he also end up inviting you to another event? 23 A. He invited -- well, okay. My assistant loved beauty 24 pageants. He was sort of in the midst of dealing with his 25 upcoming pageant. He offered us tickets, if we wanted to go.

14 there. Then he had another meeting come in. It was a gentlemen 15 with an accent. It was very sort of rushed. 16 At one point he did step out and leave us in the 2635 1 Q. Did he arrange for tickets for you to go?

2 A. Yes, he did. 3 Q. Did you end up going to the Miss USA Pageant with your 4 assistant? 5 A. Yes, at his invitation. 6 Q. You said it was very brief at Trump Tower? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Did he appear to be concerned about anybody seeing you 9 at Trump Tower?

10 A. Oh, no, he introduced me to everybody. He just seemed 11 busy. 12 Q. Let me direct your attention now to the Miss USA 13 Pageant. How did you end up getting into the pageant? 14 A. It was in California. It was in Hollywood. And he 15 left tickets under my name at Will Call for my assistant and I. 16 Q. Was he there at the time? 17 A. He was there, but I didn't see him. Or, I didn't speak 18 to him, I saw him on stage. 19 Q. Did you speak to him after the pageant? 20 A. A few times. 21 Q. Now, after the Miss USA Pageant, sometime around the 22 Summer of 2007, did you meet with him again in L.A.? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. How did that come about?

25 A. Same way I always did. He would call from a New York
2636 1 number or from Keith's number and/or Rhona's number, I guess, 2 and said he was going to be in L.A, he had the final information 3 almost all sorted out for the show; would I meet him again for 4 dinner at his bungalow, the Beverly Hills Hotel. 5 Q. Did you end up going to the bungalow? 6 A. I did. 7 Q. And how did you get there? 8 A. Mike, who was previously my publicist, we were now 9 dating, he drove me in my car.

10 Q. And had you told your boyfriend at that time about what 11 exactly had happened in the hotel room with Mr. Trump? 12 A. Not the sexual part. 13 Q. Why not? 14 A. Because I was ashamed. 15 Q. Why did you decide to go meet him at the bungalow? 16 A. To speak. Mike did know about The Apprentice thing. 17 If I suddenly didn't want to do it, it would be very weird.

18 Q. Did you meet anyone outside? 19 How did you get into his bungalow? 20 A. He gave me specific instructions. The place is kind of 21 complicated to pull up to. His bodyguard, Keith, met me at my 22 car, and Mike stayed in the car. He escorted me through like 23 these back patios to his particular building. 24 Q. Did you ask your boyfriend to just wait for you? 25 A. It was pretty common.

2637

1 Q. Did you go into the bungalow to meet with Mr. Trump?

2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And tell us a little bit about what you discussed with 4 him in the bungalow? 5 A. Same sort of thing. He was busy. He was on the phone. 6 When I got there, there were several phone calls. He was 7 watching television. I said, you know, what are we having for 8 dinner? He was watching a documentary. We were talking about 9 the documentary that he was watching about some sailors that got 10 killed by sharks or submarines. He kept trying to make sexual 11 advances, putting his hand on my leg, scooting closer, giving me 12 compliments. 13 Q. What was your response? 14 A. I told him I was on my period. 15 Q. But you told him you did not want to; is that right? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Was there more discussion about the The Apprentice?

18 A. Yes. But a lot less than I thought there would be, no 19 real update. 20 Q. And about how long did you stay? 21 A. Two hours, tops. More than an hour, less than two. 22 Q. And what did he say when you were leaving, when you 23 decided to go? 24 A. "Want to get together again? I missed you." You know, 25 the usual.

2638 1 Q. Did he on that occasion tell you to keep it 2 confidential and not to tell anyone? 3 A. Absolutely not. 4 Q. Did he appear to be concerned with anybody else finding 5 out that you were there with him? 6 A. Absolutely not. 7 Q. Was that the last time that you saw him in person? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And did he call you after this meeting in the bungalow 11 A. Like that night? 12 Q. Did he call you another time? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Approximately, how many times did he call you? 15 A. A few more times. One was to tell me that he could not 16 get me on the television show, that he had been overruled by 17 his -- he had been overruled by someone higher up's wife having 18 a problem. He owed it to them to go with their opinion, I 19 guess. 20 And he tried a couple of more times; I did not answer 21 his call. 22 Then one time I did answer, it was a New York number, I 23 didn't always know that it was him, to tell me that he did not 24 know that Jenna Jameson was going to be on the show. 25 Q. Who was Jenna Jameson?

10 in L.A., did he call you again?

2639 1 A. She is another adult film actress. She wasn't a 2 contestant on the show. Her then fiance or husband at this time 3 was Tito Ortiz, an MMA fighter, and he was on the show. She 6 Q. You didn't care at that point? 7 A. No. 8 Q. Was that the last time you spoke to him by telephone or 11 Q. And after, did you sort of stop taking calls? 12 How did you know that -- did you know one way or the 13 other whether he called you again? 14 A. I think he did a couple of more times. I have no way 15 of knowing for sure. It would be a blocked number or a New York 16 number. I didn't have a lot of people from New York calling. 17 Q. Did you stop answering those calls?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. At that point, did you move on with your life? 20 A. Absolutely. 21 Q. For the next three years, January of 2008 until about 22 May of 2011 or so, what did your life look like? 23 A. It was pretty awesome. I got a raise. I was directing 24 a lot more movies, a lot more mainstream things. That's when 25 I did the 40 Year Old Virgin and all those big movies. I
4 made a guest appearance and some stuff. He thought I was going 5 to be mad. I didn't care. 9 in person?

10 A. Yes.

2640 1 started directing music videos. I got married. I had my 2 daughter. Became a nationally-ranked equestrian with my 3 horses. 4 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 6 A. Bought a house. Moved to Texas. 7 Q. Any interactions during that time with Mr. Trump? 8 A. No. 9 Q. Let me direct your attention now to about May of 2011, 10 did you agree at that time to be interviewed for an article by a 11 magazine called In Touch? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And, first of all, what is In Touch? 14 A. It's an entertainment magazine, like a sort of tabloid, 15 fluff magazine. 16 Q. How did that come about, that you agreed to be 17 interviewed by In Touch?

18 A. One of the other performers at Wicked, Randy Spears, 19 his wife did entertainment, like PR management. Her name is 20 Gina. She reached out to me and said that someone had sold a 21 story about me and Mr. Trump to In Touch, or to a magazine -- 22 I am not sure if she said In Touch -- to a magazine, and they 23 were going to do a story, and I freaked out. 24 I don't know who leaked it. I had just had my 25 daughter. I said no at first. She said, they're going to run 5 THE COURT: I will allow it.

2641 1 it anyway, better that you take control. I didn't have money at 2 the time. You can't let somebody else make the money off of 3 you. You can make sure that it's accurate and get paid. 4 5 6

9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 2642 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 Q I'm going to ask you just to slow down again so that 3 the court reporters can get you down. 4 A I'm so sorry. 7 A Or someone else can basically speak for you and make 8 the money from it, and who knows what they'll say. 9 Q What was the -- if you agreed to do the interview and 10 get paid, would your agent -- Gina Rodriguez was your agent? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Would Gina also get paid as a result? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Did you decide to do a brief interview with In Touch?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Why did you decide to do it?

17 A For the reasons I just said. I would rather make money 18 than people make money off of me, and at least I could control 19 the narrative.

20 Q How much were you supposed to get paid for the 21 article?

22 A $15,000. 23 Q You said you just had your daughter. 24 Were you doing less work at that time?

25 A Yes.

5 Q So, she said you can either take control of it and get 6 paid or someone else will have control of it?

2643 1 Q Approximately how long was the interview that you had?

2 A It was a phone interview, like between 10 and 3 20 minutes. 4 Q What was your understanding about whether this article 5 was meant to be for entertainment purposes? 6 A One was for In Touch magazine. In Touch is like --
7 it's a gossip magazine. 8 Q Did you discuss with In Touch all of the details of 9 what happened in the room at Harrah's with Mr. Trump?

10 A No. 11 I tried to keep it fairly light-hearted and quickly to the 12 point. 13 Q Did In Touch end up running that story in 2011? 14 A No.

15 Q And, at the time, did you know why they didn't run the 17 A Not exactly, no. No, I -- I know what I was told.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: May we approach just for a 19 moment?

20 THE COURT: Sure. 21 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 22 at sidebar:) 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, we're now at the point at 24 which I would elicit that in 2011, she had an encounter in 25 a parking lot with a gentleman who said, "Leave it alone,"
16 story?

2644 1 about the article.

2 I would like to elicit it because, again, it's 3 been brought out on cross-examination with Keith Davidson. 4 It also goes to explain that, because she felt 5 threatened, why she made certain decisions about what to 6 discuss when and what not to discuss when publicly, and 7 why she agreed to go public with the NDA. 8 I want to make sure I'm staying in line with your 9 Honor's directive.

10 MS. NECHELES: She didn't make this claim at the 11 time.

12 It's much later that she starts saying she was 13 threatened. In 2018, she said she was threatened. 14 In 2011, she'll say she didn't tell anybody about 15 it. 16 We'll get into that whole sideshow, and it puts a 17 spectre of --
18 THE COURT: Are you bringing that in on 19 cross-examination?

20 MS. NECHELES: If she brings it in. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: It's already been brought up.

22 THE COURT: What did the person say? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: She was in the car with her 24 daughter; and the person said, "It would be a shame if 25 something happened to your daughter."
1 They brought it out. And it's been the basis for 2 the defamation claim. That's how they brought it out. 3 THE COURT: Remind me how. 4 MS. HOFFINGER: In the opening statement, they 5 said the courts have decided how she owed him legal fees. 6 Michael Avenatti, in 2018, released a sketch of a 7 man in the car who threatened her. 8 Mr. Trump said, "It's a con job."
19 THE COURT: I do recall you bringing that out.

20 MS. NECHELES: We were going on the fact -- 21 THE COURT: The jury, now, is wondering: Why?

22 What is she talking about? Why did this happen? 23 I think the jury is entitled to know what led up 24 to that, which you introduced.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: I'll do it briefly.

11 The Court said it was hyperbole and not 12 defamation. 13 Mr. Trump, as a result, was awarded legal fees. 14 They brought it out on cross-examination.

15 I don't want to leave it to their 16 cross-examination.

17 MS. NECHELES: We're going into the fact that she 18 owes money to Trump, and she hasn't paid it.

2645 9 Mr. Avenatti said it was not. Mr. Avenatti said 10 it was defamation.

2646 1 THE COURT: Very briefly.

4 Q Ms. Daniels, some weeks after you were interviewed by 5 In Touch, did you have an experience in about June of 2011 with 6 an encounter in a parking lot in Las Vegas?

7 A Yes, I did. 8 Q Will you tell the jury, just briefly, what happened. 9 A Um, my daughter, who was an infant at the time, was --
10 my daughter and I went to a, um, like postpartum -- like a 11 workout for a Mommy and Me workout thing. And I was approached 12 by a man in the parking lot in Las Vegas in the center of -- of 13 a shopping center that the class was located in. And I thought 14 he was the father or the husband of one of the other women in 15 the class. 16 And he approached me and said that -- he threatened me not 17 to continue to tell my story.

18 Q When you say "to continue to tell" your "story", about 19 who?

20 A About my encounter with Mr. Trump. 21 Q Did you tell the police at the time?

22 A No. 23 Q Why not? 24 A 'Cause he told me not to say anything at all. And I
25 was scared. Um, and I didn't want more of the story coming out.

2 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 3 in open court:)
2647 1 My daughter's father also was struggling with his own 2 personal issues at the time. 3 Q So, did you tell your boyfriend at the time -- 4 A No.

5 Q -- about the encounter? 6 A No.

7 Q That's because you were concerned about him?

10 Q Why did you not tell him? 11 A Um, he was struggling mentally with some postpartum 12 stuff with our daughter and his alcoholism. Um, and I had never 13 told him about the fact that I'd had sex with Trump. So, for me 14 to tell him then, at that moment, when his whole world was 15 exploding, would have just not been good at all, on any level. 16 Q Now, let me direct your attention to about October of 17 2011.

18 Did you become aware at around that time that an article 19 had come out and been posted online about your encounter with 20 Mr. Trump on a site called thedirty.com? 21 A Yes.

22 Gina called and told me. 23 Q Would that be Gina Rodriguez? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Can you just tell the jury, what is thedirty.com, 9 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 MS. NECHELES: Objection to leading.

2648 1 first?

2 A It is not a site that I look at, so I'm not entirely 3 sure. But, it is the online equivalent to a tabloid. A gossip 4 site. Trash site. 5 Q You said Gina Rodriguez told you there was something 6 up on thedirty.com?

7 A Yes.

8 She called and told me about it. I think she might have 9 sent me a link, and I looked at it.

10 It's not a site I looked at at the time. Celebrity gossip 11 site.

12 Q Did you provide information to that site?

13 A No. I never even heard of that site at that time. 14 Q Were you concerned about it being up at the time? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Why were you concerned?

17 A Because I had been threatened, and I didn't want the 18 person who threatened me and my baby thinking I had done it. 19 Q At that point, did you want it taken down? 20 A Absolutely. 21 Q What, if anything, did Gina, your agent --
22 A Well --
23 Q Hold up -- say about being able to take it down? 24 A I remember I was freaking out and crying and 25 hyperventilating and asked her what I should do.

2649 1 And she asked me for permission to have her attorney remove 2 it for me. 3 Q Did she tell you the name of her attorney at the time? 4 A Keith Davidson.

5 Q Did you tell her that, yes, you would be happy for her 13 A Yes. 14 Q And sometime after he announced that he was running 15 for President, did someone reach out to you again about telling 16 your account of what happened with Mr. Trump?

17 A Yes.

18 Q Who was that? 19 A Well, lots of people did.

20 Q Did Gina Rodriguez reach out to you? 21 A Yes.

22 Q What did she suggest that she could do? 23 A That she could sell the story again. 24 Q And did she suggest that, in terms of selling the 25 story, that money could be made to -- paid to do this?

6 attorney to try to take it down?

7 A Absolutely. Hhhh. 8 Q Was he, in fact, successful in doing that? 9 A I assume so, because it came down.

10 Q Now, I'd like to direct your attention now to 2015. 11 Were you aware at some point that Mr. Trump announced that 12 he was running for President?

2650 1 A Of course. That's the reason to sell it.

2 Q Did she say that she could make money, as well? 3 A Yes. Of course. 4 Q Did there come a time that you had a conversation with 5 a friend of yours who was also an attorney -- 6 A Yes.

7 Q -- about whether you should publicly tell your story? 8 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 9 THE COURT: Sustained.

10 Q Without telling us the substance -- withdrawn. 11 Did you have a conversation with a friend of yours who is 12 an attorney? 13 A Lots. Yes. 14 Q And this particular friend who you had a discussion 15 with, were you seeking legal advice from him? 16 A No.

17 I was just having lunch with him.

18 Q And did you decide, based on a conversation with him, 19 about what you should do about getting the details of your 20 story out? 21 A Yes. I do remember asking him what he thought about 22 the Gina situation because I had been threatened. 23 And he said that he thought it was really a really good 24 idea, that he was concerned about my safety.

25 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

2651 1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 MS. NECHELES: Move to strike. 3 THE COURT: Stricken.

6 A Yes.

7 He helped me set up a press conference that we didn't end 8 up doing. 9 Q Did your conversation with him and what happened to 10 you in the parking lot in Las Vegas in 2011 guide your decision 11 about telling your story as a way to make sure that it was 12 documented and out there? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And did you have an understanding at that time or 18 Q Well, did it guide your decision, in general, about 19 what to do?

20 A Absolutely. 21 Q Did you decide to let Gina try to sell your story to 22 some news outlets? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Do you recall, in early October of 2016, the Access 25 Hollywood tape coming out publicly?

4 Q Did your conversation with him guide your decision to 5 have your story documented or out there in some way?

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

15 belief that by doing that, it would keep you safer in some way? 16 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

1 A Yeah.

2652 2 Q You know what that is? You're aware of what that is? 3 A Yes. 4 Gina had actually told me about it.

5 Q Before the Access Hollywood tape came out, was Gina 8 Q Was she successful in doing so before that Access 10 A No. 11 Q Now, after the Access Hollywood tape came out, did 12 Gina have some conversations with you about her ability to try 13 to sell the story after it came out? 14 A Yes.

15 Q What, in substance, did she tell you? 16 A In a nutshell --
17 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. 19 Q Did you continue to agree at that time that she could 20 sell your story to news outlets? 21 A Yes, I told her she could keep trying. More people 22 were calling. (Shrugs). 23 Q What you described for the jury previously about your 24 encounter with Mr. Trump in the hotel room, your seeing him on 25 a number of other occasions, the telephone calls from Mr. Trump 9 Hollywood tape came out?

6 trying to sell your story to news outlets?

7 A Yes.

2653 1 to you, is that, generally, what you would have described to 2 the news outlets at that time, in October of 2016, if you had 3 been thoroughly interviewed? 4 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 Q At that point, in October of 2016, was Gina's focus 7 and your focus on selling the story to the news outlets? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Did you have any intention of approaching either 10 Mr. Trump or Michael Cohen, his attorney, to have them pay for 11 your story?

12 A No. 13 My motivation wasn't money. It's to get the story out. 14 Q That was, in part, guided by your experience in 2011 15 and your conversations with -- 16 A It was motivated out of fear, not money.

17 Q Did there come a time that you learned, in 18 approximately October of 2016, that Donald Trump and Michael 19 Cohen were interested in buying the rights to your account?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And how did you learn that?

22 A Gina told me. 23 Q And, approximately when was that, that Gina told you 24 that, that there was interest there in paying for your story?

25 A In October. May at the earliest. Latest, September.

2654 1 But, it was October, I believe -- yeah. October.

2 Q And, it was after release of the Access Hollywood 3 tape? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Now, who did you understand -- when Gina told you 6 that, who did you understand that Michael Cohen was 7 representing at the time? 8 A Donald Trump. 9 Q And did you understand at the time that they would pay 10 for your story, for you not to release it publicly? 11 A Yes.

13 Honor. 12 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the leading, your 14 THE COURT: Sustained as to leading.

15 Q What did you understand they were interested in paying 16 you for?

17 A Um, they were interested in paying for the story, 18 which was the best thing that could happen because then my 19 husband wouldn't find out, but there was still a documentation 20 of a money exchange and a paperwork exchange, so that I would 21 be safe and the story wouldn't come out.

22 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 23 THE COURT: Overruled. 24 Q Did you -- were you told by Ms. Rodriguez how much, in 25 total, would be paid from Donald Trump and Michael Cohen to 2655 1 purchase the rights to your story?

2 A $130,000. 3 Q And how did you feel about that $130,000 at the time? 4 A Didn't care. I didn't care about the amount. It was 5 just to get it done. 6 Q Were you happy --
7 A Of course. Well, of course. It's money, but the number 8 didn't matter to me. 9 And I didn't pick the number.

10 Q And did you -- did you negotiate that number at all?

12 Q Why didn't you ask for more money? 13 A Because I didn't care about the money.

16 A It was the best it had ever been.

17 Q I'm sorry?

18 A The best it had ever been. Instead of directing five 19 movies a year, I directed ten. I had gotten several raises. I
20 bought a house. We no longer lived in California, which was 21 really expensive. And I was able to go back to work. I was 22 working for a while, but it was on camera and on stage. Things 23 were good, very good. 24 I was winning with my horses, too.

25 Q Let me direct your attention to October 10, 2016.

14 Q What was your financial outlook in that time, in 15 October of 2016, relative to earlier years?

11 A No.

2656 1 Were you presented on that date with an Agreement to sign 2 at that time? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Tell us how that occurred and what sort of an 5 Agreement. 6 A It was an NDA.

7 Q Explain to the jury what an "NDA" is, what your 8 understanding of an NDA is. 9 A NDA stands for non-disclosure. It is a contract 10 between people or parties to keep information secret. 11 Q And, who did you understand was the beneficiary of 15 A Michael Cohen. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Let me now ask you to show, 17 please, People's 63 which is in evidence.

18 You can display that for everyone. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the body of that 21 email, please.

22 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q Can you read that? 24 First of all, can you tell us who the email is from and who 25 it's to?

14 Q Who was representing him at the time? 13 A Donald Trump. 12 that NDA?

2657

1 A It's from Keith Davidson and was to Michael Cohen.

2 Q Who was Keith Davidson in relation to you at this
3 point? 4 A Um, he was acting as my attorney.

5 He was Gina Rodriguez's attorney who handled this sort of 6 thing for her.

7 Q Did you understand he would handle this NDA for you? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Who was the email -- you said it's from Keith Davidson 10 to who? 11 A To Michael Cohen.

12 Q What does it say in the "To" line? 13 A "To: Michael Cohen, Trump Organization. First 14 Administrative Group."
15 Q What does the subject line say? 16 A "SD versus RCI."
17 Q Can you read, please, the email for us?

18 A What's that? Sorry? 19 Q From Michael.

20 A Read the email? 21 Q Yes, please.

22 A It says: "Michael, please find Ms. Daniels' 23 Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement attached. I have 24 not filled in the Side Letter Agreement, SLA, which identities

25 the parties to this Agreement. Under the terms of the
2658 1 Agreement, neither my client or I are entitled to possession of 2 the SLA. 3 "The settlement sum is 130,000. I have also attached my 4 firm's wiring instructions for your reference.

5 "Ms. Daniels expressed dissatisfaction with your schedule 6 of a delay for ten days of for funding. To that end, you'll see 7 that I placed this Friday, 10/14/16, as the funding deadline. 8 Let me know if this is a problem. 9 "Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about 10 anything. Keith." 11 Then his cell phone.

12 Q Did you express dissatisfaction and want this signed 13 and done by October 14th? 14 A Absolutely.

15 Q Why was that? 16 A Because I was afraid that if he -- that if it wasn't 17 done before the nomination and things, that I wouldn't be safe, 18 or that he would never pay, and there wouldn't be a trail to 19 keep me safe.

20 Q When you say "before the nomination", was Mr. Trump 21 already the nominee at that point of the Republican Party?

22 A I believe so. 23 In the election. Sorry. The election is what I meant to 24 say. The election.

25 Q That's okay.

1 What did you understand were the general terms of this 2659 2 Confidential Settlement Agreement or Non-Disclosure Agreement? 3 A I'm not sure I understand.

6 A So that in exchange for the -- the sum of $130,000, 11 Q And that you would get paid the sum of $130,000?

12 A Correct. 13 Q Was there -- do you remember if there was a liquidated 14 damages or damages clause if you breached --
15 A Yeah. 16 If I spoke, it was like a million dollars every time I said 17 something.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show Page 2 now of this 19 exhibit, People's 63.

20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 21 Q Do you recognize this Side Letter Agreement?

22 A Yes. 23 Q What did you -- what was your understanding of the 24 purpose of this Side Letter Agreement?

25 A To identify who the fake names were.

10 other at all. Basically.

4 Q What did you understand at this point about what the 5 general terms were of this agreement?

7 that I could not tell my story. That he also couldn't tell the 8 story. We could not contact each other or each other's families 9 or representatives. We had to pretend like we didn't know each 2660 1 Q What do you mean by that?

2 Were there actual names disclosed in the NDA? 3 A No. 4 In the original paperwork, instead of saying "Stormy 5 Daniels" or "Stephanie Clifford", it identified me as one party 6 and Mr. Trump as the other party. They gave us, like, fake 7 names, pseudonyms of "Peggy" and "David". I think it was 9 Q "David Dennison"?

10 A Yeah. 11 This was the Side Letter that went to it, that identified 12 that I was "Peggy" and he was "David". 13 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we just take a quick look at 14 Page 3 on the PDF, of the signature line.

15 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 16 Q Is that your signature there on the line for "Peggy 17 Peterson a/k/a Stephanie Gregory Clifford a/k/a Stormy 18 Daniels"? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And how did you sign it? 21 A Stephanie Clifford.

22 What do you mean? 23 Q What's the date that you signed it? 24 A Oh. 10/10/16.

25 Q And you signed it with your name as "Peggy Peterson";
8 "David".

2661 1 is that right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q Now, if we could look -- did you also initial this 4 agreement with initials "PP" for Peggy Peterson?

5 A Yes. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's look at the Settlement 7 Agreement, Page 1, which I believe is Page 4 on the PDF. 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20 Q This is Page 10 of the Settlement Agreement. 21 Do you see a list of names there?

22 A Yes. 23 Q What were those list of names? 24 Did you write in those list of names?

25 A I did.

10 where it shows the initials of PP. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Did you initial it "PP"? 13 A Uh-huh. 14 Q As far as you recall, did you initial various pages as 15 "Peggy Peterson"? 16 A Yes.

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at Page 10 of 18 the PDF, where there's a list of names. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
9 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you show the bottom place 2662 1 Q Why did you write them in?

2 A Because I was asked to write down names of people who 3 knew all the details. 4 Q Those were some of the people that you told?

5 A Yes. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we look, also, at Page 15, 13 A Yes. 14 Q What did you sign it as?

15 A "Peggy Peterson". 16 Q And why did you not put your real name there?

17 A Because I was instructed not to, that we were using 18 pseudonyms. 19 Q After you signed the Agreement, the Side Letter 20 Agreement, and the Settlement Agreement, otherwise known as a 21 Non-Disclosure Agreement, did Gina Rodriguez, generally, just 22 keep you updated on the progress of the deal? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And did you get paid the $130,000 on October 14, 2016, 25 as was disclosed in that email?

11 Q This is the Non-Disclosure Agreement or the Settlement 12 Agreement; and did you sign it?

7 please, of the Agreement, which is Page 18 in the PDF. 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the signature, 10 please?

2663 1 A No. It was late.

2 Q What did you understand about the reason for the 3 delay? What was happening? 4 A I didn't know why it was late.

10 Q That was your understanding? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Because you understood Michael Cohen represented 13 Mr. Trump? 14 A Correct.

15 Q Were you concerned about why these excuses were being 16 made and there was a delay in the payment?

17 A Yes.

18 Q What was your concern? 19 A Well, I mean, he, obviously -- that sum of money 20 shouldn't matter, so it wasn't a financial delay. So, it made 21 me more concerned that something bad was gonna happen, and that 22 if it wasn't done before the election, that it was not ever 23 going to happen because he got whatever he wanted. And it goes 24 all the way back to me not being safe.

25 Q Let me direct your attention now --
8 A Michael Cohen to Keith Davidson, because of -- Trump 9 to Cohen, and Cohen to Davidson.

6 Q And what is your understanding about who kept making 5 He just kept making excuses.

7 excuses?

1 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, would you like to break 2 soon, or would you like me to continue? 3 THE COURT: Is this a good breaking point? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Certainly.

5 THE COURT: Jurors, we will take a lunch recess. 6 I remind you of all my instructions, including 7 not to discuss this case either amongst yourselves or with 8 anyone else. 9 Continue to keep an open mind as to the 10 defendant's guilt or innocence.

19 THE COURT: Is there anything that we need to 20 discuss at this time? 21 MS. HOFFINGER: No, your Honor.

22 MS. NECHELES: No. 23 MR. STEINGLASS: I'm going to hand up a copy of 24 the stipulation that was entered into evidence the other 25 day to be marked as a Court Exhibit.

2664 13 Let's get started at 2 o'clock. 14 COURT OFFICER: All rise.

15 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 16 are excused.)
17 THE COURT: You may step down.

18 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
11 Please do not form or express an opinion as to 12 the defendant's guilt or innocence.

2665 1 THE COURT: Thank you.

2 Enjoy your lunch.

2 THE COURT: Good afternoon. 3 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor. 7 Mr. Blanche. 8 MR. BLANCHE: Oh, your Honor, I'm sorry. 9 THE COURT: Just for the record, my Chambers 10 reached out to the People and Defense Counsel to ask if 11 Defense Counsel wanted a limiting instruction on the 12 encounter that took place in the parking lot where 13 Ms. Daniels claims that someone had threatened her. 14 I will not give a limiting instruction unless the 15 Defense requests it. 16 And even then, I would ask the two sides to see if 17 you can agree on a proposed limiting instruction. 18 I realize that you haven't had a lot of time to 19 work on that.

20 But I also received your email that you wanted to 21 make an application.

22 Please go ahead. 23 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. 24 We move for a mistrial based on the testimony this 25 morning.

4 THE COURT: If I could have a second, Mr. Blanche.

5 MR. BLANCHE: Pardon me? 6 THE COURT: If I could just have one second, 2667 4 And the guardrails by this witness, answering 5 questions from the Government, were just thrown to the 6 side.

7 And there is no way to unring the bell, in our 8 view, and that the testimony that came in was so unduly and 9 inappropriately prejudicial to President Trump and the 10 actual charges that are at issue in this case that there is 11 no remedy that we can fashion or we believe the Court can 12 fashion to unring this bell.

13 I mean, the testimony, your Honor, about the 14 alleged incident back in 2006, a lot of the testimony that 15 this witness talked about today is way different than the 16 story that she was pedaling in 2016, your Honor. Which is, 17 from my understanding of what the ADAs said this morning, 18 the only reason why this evidence is even admissible, right, 19 is to talk about the information that was supposedly kept 20 from the voters in 2016. 23 testimony from the -- from her employer that you had to wear 24 a condom; that there was always -- that there was always a 25 condom worn; the height of the two individuals; the fact 1 Your Honor, there are a couple of different 2 reasons, but what's clear is that the Court set guardrails 3 for this testimony.

21 There was testimony today about being blacked out; 22 about not wearing a condom, which was after there was 2668 12 And on top of that, your Honor, even after the 13 incident, there was testimony about a second alleged sexual 14 advance sometime later on. Totally irrelevant to this case. 15 And there is no reason that should have been 16 elicited, your Honor.

17 Again, we don't even know that that's coming, 18 because we don't get notes of what this witness has said in 19 prep.

22 President Trump afterwards and that she thought something 23 bad was going to happen and that she was worried about not 24 being safe. 25 She then repeatedly testified about purported 1 that -- you know, the things like the spacing in the room; 2 the fact that there is a bodyguard outside the room; the 3 power dynamics. 4 She testified -- the question was: Do you want out 5 of the trailer park? 6 And all of this has nothing to do with this case.

7 And it's extraordinarily prejudicial and it's something that 8 is -- the only reason why the Government asked those 9 questions, aside from pure embarrassment, is to -- is to 10 inflame this jury to not -- to not look at the evidence that 11 matters, but to just hear from this witness. 20 The last one we got was from last year, your Honor. 21 She testified that there was communications with 2669 1 alleged meetings with President Trump, and with every single 2 one she qualified that it was in an open place, in a public 3 place. 4 What's the jury to do with that? 5 And for many of those you sustained objections to, 6 Judge, and that is true, but it was said repeatedly; and the 7 jury hears it.

8 And I am sure that the transcript will say 9 "objection sustained," by your Honor, but it's still 10 extraordinarily prejudicial to insert safety and safety 11 concerns into a trial about business records. 15 Ms. Daniels' changed testimony. 16 For years, including up to 2016, which is -- which 17 is when she was pedaling this story, she talked about a 18 consensual encounter with President Trump that she was 19 trying to sell. 20 That's what Mr. Davidson talked about. 21 That's purportedly what Mr. Cohen was told.

22 And that's not the story that we heard today. We 23 heard a completely different story. 24 And the reason why that matters is because, of 25 course, we are going to cross-examine her on the fact that 12 And, you know, I know your Honor knows this, but 13 this is exactly what President Trump was -- what we raised 14 with the Court, seeking an adjournment based upon 2670 1 her story has changed.

2 And I'm sure the Government will then say we've 3 opened the door and then they can then go ahead and ask even 4 more questions about what she wants to say about what 5 happened in 2006. 6 But, it's so prejudicial in a case about an NDA and 7 whether there were false records placed on The Trump 8 Organization's books in 2017. 9 And, you know, I think your Honor knew that this 10 was an issue by setting up guardrails along the way and this 11 morning.

12 But now we've heard it. And it is an issue.

13 And it's not -- how can you unring the bell? 14 And we are going to cross-examine her shortly, 15 presumably, and talk about -- and then elicit the fact that 16 she denied twice. 19 But, that's not really the issue. 20 I mean, that's going to be the cross. 21 The issue is she has testified today about consent, 22 about danger.

23 That's not the point of this case. 24 That's not the point of her testimony. 25 And that's not what she was pedaling, that's not --
17 There were articles that said that she denied it, 18 that she denied this took place.

2671 1 I'm sorry -- not what she was pedaling, that's not the story 2 that she was selling in 2016; and now we're here.

3 I mean, the least of which is the fact that just 4 over lunch, people are already reporting -- everybody is 5 reporting that she's suggesting consent. 6 Again, that's a new fact, and it's extraordinarily 7 prejudicial.

8 And the mere fact that she says there was consent, 9 after saying she blacked out, doesn't remember anything, 10 they only had water, but she doesn't remember anything, this 11 is the kind of testimony that makes it impossible to come 12 back from.

13 I mean, you know, not even talking about the fact 14 that we are talking about somebody who is going to go out 15 and campaign this afternoon and how unfair it is in that 16 environment, as well.

17 But, the Government must have known this was coming 18 out. 19 And it's just, you know -- we sit here listening to 20 it. 21 And we objected to it the best that we could.

22 But, you know, this has nothing to do with the 23 reason why we're here, your Honor. 24 And even the limited fact that she signed the NDA,

25 the limited fact that she was selling this story over the
2672 10 process stays exactly where it should be, which is about 11 whether there were false records on The Trump Organization's 12 books and put on in 2017?

13 So, we believe, regrettably, that there should be a 14 mistrial; and that to the extent that there is another 15 trial, that this witness is either excluded or that her 16 testimony is extremely limited to the guardrails, frankly, 17 that your Honor set this morning.

18 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Blanche. 19 People. 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes. Thank you, your Honor. 21 Again, I would just note, this was fully briefed by 22 the defense in their motions in limine.

23 And your Honor did not put any guardrails on her 24 testimony. 25 Recognizing, of course, that this completes her 1 years, including at the time of the election, that's not 2 what we heard today. That's not how the evidence came in 3 from this witness. 4 Of course, your Honor cut her off several times, 5 but there was so much -- and we haven't looked at the 6 transcript to give all of the examples. And we are happy to 7 do so if that's helpful.

8 But, how can we come back from this in a way that's 9 fair to President Trump and in a way to make sure that this 2673 3 And this story, your Honor, her account is highly 4 probative of the defendant's intent, his intent and his 5 motive in paying this off, and making sure that the American 6 public did not hear this before the election.

7 It is precisely what the defendant did not want to 8 become public. 9 I will say, without getting into too many details, 10 that Mr. Blanche's recitation of the fact that this is 11 entirely new is not true.

12 I will say that, and I'm sure that he knows this, 13 that the account and things like the fact that a condom was 14 not used has been out there for a very, very long time. 15 This is not new. 16 This is not a new account.

17 Now, there were certain details that I told your 20 You asked me not to, and I did not. 21 But, you know, the other thing is, Judge, they 22 opened the door to this.

23 So, the 2011 threat to her was opened on not only 24 in their opening when they talked about legal fees and that

25 she was changing -- you know, coming up with this story,
1 account -- her account completes the narrative of the events 2 that precipitated the falsification of business records.

18 Honor that she remembered after a movie in 2019, and I was 19 going to elicit that.

2674 1 because she's an opportunist, out to make money and that she 2 owes Mr. Trump legal fees.

3 So, they opened the door. That's the subject of 4 the defamation case. 5 Second, they specifically put in an exhibit which 6 was admitted in evidence, through Keith Davidson's 7 testimony, where they referenced this threat in 2011, saying 8 that it was not true. 9 And, so, it was incumbent upon us to bring out 10 those details in her direct, again, to rehabilitate 11 credibility where they attacked it both during Keith 12 Davidson's testimony and on opening.

13 So, your Honor, we were extremely mindful of not 14 eliciting too much testimony about the actual act. 15 We did it initially before your Honor even asked us 16 to carve it back.

17 Additionally, so there were details that were left 18 out based on the Court's instructions at the bench. 19 They were additional details that were not brought 20 out. 21 But, your Honor, this -- stating that this is an 22 entirely new story is not accurate.

23 And I'm certain that when they cross-examine 24 Ms. Daniels, some of this will come out, and some of this 25 will come out on redirect.

2675 1 And I know that your Honor has mentioned that you 2 will allow me to elicit some of it on redirect in terms of 3 what issues came up publicly and what details were 4 remembered at different times based on different things. 5 But they opened the door to the threat in 2011. 6 And now your Honor has asked us to discuss a limiting 7 instruction on that, and we can certainly do that.

8 We have written one that we have written up quickly 9 that we can discuss with defense counsel, if they would like 10 that. 11 But, your Honor, this goes directly to her 12 credibility, which they attacked and while I'm sure will 13 continue to attack, they opened the door in their opening, 14 they opened the door in Keith Davidson's testimony, and 15 these are not all new details. 18 And in terms of the payoff in 2016 before the 19 election. 23 We have carved back details. 24 We have been mindful of your Honor's decision. 25 And we have carved it back even before them, so I 16 But, at the end of the day, your Honor, this is 17 what defendant was trying to hide.

20 This is an exhibit. If you were -- if you would, 21 of what they were trying -- what Mr. Trump wanted to make 22 sure didn't get disclosed.

2676 1 don't think there is any basis for a mistrial, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Thank you.

3 MR. BLANCHE: Just briefly, your Honor. That 4 misses the point a little bit of our argument. 5 The point of the argument is that the reason why 6 this evidence, in theory, is admissible, over our objection, 16 time. 19 The voters decided in 2016. The People are going 20 to make a lot of that in their summation, I expect. 21 And, Judge, I don't think anybody, anybody can 24 And it's the kind of testimony that's so 25 prejudicial that you have to run -- you run the very high 7 is because this is -- these, in theory, are the facts which 8 was presented to Mr. Davidson and Mr. Cohen so that they 9 could evaluate whether they could enter into an NDA and, 10 supposedly, the fact and the details that were going to be 11 kept from the American people in 2016.

12 That's the theory for this evidence coming in.

13 The problem is that isn't what came in. 14 And so what -- instead, what came in is this 15 extraordinarily prejudicial testimony that has changed over 17 And we can't fix that except to cross-examine her, 18 but it's still -- it has nothing to do with the case.

22 listen to what that witness said and think that that has 23 anything to do with the charged conduct.

2677 1 risk of the jury -- of the jury not being able to focus on 2 the evidence that actually does matter.

3 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, may I just add one 4 thing? 5 Mr. Blanche mentioned about the threat, and so on. 6 She testified about it directly that she was not 7 threatened either physically or verbally by Mr. Trump.

8 We made sure to elicit that.

23 give them the opportunity to try to control the witness. It 24 was not easy. 25 Having said that, I do think that there were 12 We submit, your Honor, he knew the details of what 13 occurred in the room. 14 THE COURT: Okay. I can rule on this. 15 All right. As a threshold matter, Mr. Blanche, I 16 agree that there were some things that would probably have 17 been better left unsaid.

18 I think that there are some areas that would have 19 been better if the People did not go into them. 20 In fairness to the People, I think the witness was 21 a little difficult to control.

22 And that's why I was permitting some leading, to 10 At the end of the day, it was the defendant who 11 knew the details.

9 We made sure to say she did not say no.

2678 1 guardrails in place.

2 I do think that the Court instructed the 7 unsaid.

13 Where there was a motion to strike testimony, for 14 the most part, that motion was granted as well. 15 I will also note that I was surprised that there 16 were not more objections at various times during the 17 testimony.

18 And, in fact, at one point the Court sua sponte 19 objected because there was no objection coming from the 20 defense. 21 So, when you say that, you know, the bell has been 22 rung, the defense has to take some responsibility for that.

23 The Court has done everything that I can possibly 24 do to protect both sides and to ensure fairness and that's 25 why, again, I objected on my own.

3 Prosecution that there were certain details that we don't 4 need to get into. 5 And, again, I'm not dismissing what you are saying. 6 I do think that there were some things that were better left 8 Having said that, I don't believe we are at the 9 point where a mistrial is warranted.

10 There are a few things that go along with that. 11 I will note that where there were objections, the 12 objections, for the most part, were sustained.

2679 1 Whether these are new stories or not new stories, 2 the remedy is on cross-examination.

3 And, in fact, if they are new stories, the more 4 fodder that I will expect to see on cross-examination, if 5 you have any. 6 I also believe -- if you want, I will give a 7 limiting instruction regarding the incident at the parking 8 lot in 2011. 9 Just bear with me one moment.

10 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, can I just object to 11 that --
17 sustained it.

20 I didn't want to keep saying objection. 21 THE COURT: That's a very general statement, 22 Ms. Necheles.

23 That's not accurate. If you are going to say 24 something like that, be accurate. 25 MS. NECHELES: Well, I'm trying to be accurate.

12 THE COURT: One second, Ms. Necheles, please.

13 (Pause.) 14 THE COURT: Yes, Ms. Necheles? 15 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I think -- I just wanted 16 to be a little clearer, I did see that you, on your own, 18 But, we had moved beforehand to try to limit all of 19 this, and your Honor had ruled that it could come in, and so 2680 6 So I didn't agree with everything that you 13 had gone too far, we did start objecting very consistently. 14 But, up until that point, we really felt like your 15 Honor had ruled at the bench that they were allowed to do 16 what they were doing.

17 So, I just wanted to be clear on that.

18 THE COURT: Well, we have to agree to disagree on 19 that.

1 THE COURT: For example, I sustained a request that 2 the People not be permitted to go into or, what was it, the 3 Roger Ailes -- is that his name -- I agreed with you that 4 that would be extremely prejudicial and I didn't want them 5 to go into that.

7 requested, but I did agree with some things that you asked.

8 MS. NECHELES: Right. 9 And so, based on that ruling is what we were 10 following. 11 That's why we were not standing up and objecting.

12 And once your Honor signaled that you thought it 20 I think that I said multiple times to you and to 21 the Prosecution that we were going into way too much 22 details, we were going into much more than we needed to, 23 it wasn't necessary. 24 I still believed that it wasn't necessary. 25 Having said that, though, I don't think that we 2681 1 have reached a point where a mistrial is in order.

2 I believe that a limiting instruction as to that 3 incident in 2011 will cure that issue. 4 And I believe that you have a remedy of 5 cross-examination. 6 And, as I said before, the more times the story has 7 been changed, the more fodder for cross-examination that you 9 So, I'm going to deny your motion for a mistrial at 10 this time. 11 Anything else?

12 Do you want to discuss a limiting instruction 13 now? 14 (Defense counsel confer.) 15 ********** 16 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we approach?

17 THE COURT: Sure.

18 ******* 19 (At Sidebar.) 20 MR. STEINGLASS: I'm sorry. I think we agreed on 21 most of the language.

22 And we can kick over the last part to you. So 23 here -- I will read my version -- our version. Our version. 24 And then I will read their version.

25 Our version is: You have heard testimony from
8 have.

2682 1 Ms. Daniels regarding a 2011 incident in which she testified 2 about being threatened in a parking lot.

3 This testimony was permitted to explain any impact 4 this interaction may have had on the witness's state of 5 mind, her credibility, and her willingness to publicly 8 Our version then says: You must not draw any 9 inference that Mr. Trump was behind any such threats, nor 10 may you draw any inference unfavorable to the defendant as a 11 result of this testimony.

12 The version from the defense says: I instruct you 13 that Mr. Trump had nothing to do with any threat to this 14 witness, and you may not draw any inference unfavorable to 15 the defendant as a result of this testimony. 16 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, can I just interrupt?

17 I don't like even hearing it right now. This is 18 going too quick, honestly. 19 We haven't really had time to think about it. 20 THE COURT: Do you want to think about it? 21 MS. NECHELES: Yes. Because even hearing it, it 22 sounds like your Honor is saying, yeah, this actually 23 happened and we contest it. We're going to have to cross on 24 this. 25 THE COURT: Okay. You can think about it and get 6 disclose aspects of her account -- encounter with Mr. Trump.

7 That's the part we agree on.

1 it to me Thursday morning.

2 MS. NECHELES: Yes, Judge.

5 her to be cautious about any testimony that -- 6 THE COURT: Is there any objection to that?

7 MS. NECHELES: No, Judge. No objection.

8 THE COURT: Okay. You can take a minute to do 9 that.

10 MS. NECHELES: Thank you. 11 MR. STEINGLASS: Do you want to take a picture of 12 this?

13 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, please. 14 (Sidebar concluded.) 15 ******** 16 THE COURT: Let me know when you are ready?

17 THE COURT REPORTER: I'm ready.

18 THE COURT: As we discussed at the bench, the 19 People submitted a proposed limiting instruction, then I was 20 also shown the additional language that the Defense wanted 21 to include.

22 And, upon further discussion, we have agreed that 23 we are going to take some more time to think about it. 24 And you will get it back to me by Thursday

25 morning.
2683 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, may I have a few minutes to 4 talk to the witness in at effort to just, perhaps, instruct 1 MS. NECHELES: Yes, your Honor.

2684 2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor. Yes, your 4 Honor. 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 So, with the consent of defense counsel, 7 Ms. Hoffinger has stepped out for minute to give some 8 instruction to her witness and make sure that the witness 9 stays focused on the question and just gives the answer and 10 does not provide any unnecessary narrative. 11 (Pause in the proceedings.)
12 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger, have you had a chance to 13 speak to your witness? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. 16 Let's get the witness, please.

7 "Michael, I have been charged by my client with forwarding 8 the below message."
2687 1 I have no idea what that is.

2 Q Ab initio. 5 Q Did you authorize the cancellation of this deal at this 6 point? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And why was that? 9 A Because the funds hadn't been sent.

10 Q Now, during the time that you -- that the deal was 11 being delayed and when you cancelled this and your lawyer on 12 your behalf cancelled it, did you speak to a news outlet? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Was it Slate? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And was Slate going to pay you for that? 17 A No.

Just with different dates. 9 Q And so did this deal include, again, a million dollar 10 breach liquidated damages clause? 11 A Yes. 12 Q And did you sign this Agreement? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Okay. 15 MS.

10 Q And is that for -- stands for what? 11 A I think that's what it is. Honestly, I don't remember. 12 Q Okay. Is that for Stormy Daniels? 13 A Uh-huh. 14 Q And did you sign each of the pages of this Agreement 15 that way over the initials, the initials of yours? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And can you take a look at Page 17 of the PDF, please.

18 (Displayed.) 19 Q Do you recognize this Side Letter Agreement? 20 A Yes. 22 highlight or blow up the signature, bottom right. 23 (Displayed.) 24 Q And did you sign it there? 25 A I did. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: And can you, please, just 5 (Displayed.)

13 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you blow that up. 14 (Displayed.)
2691 1 A Yes.

2 Q And what did you sign your name as? 3 A Stephanie Clifford. 7 Q On what date did you sign that? 8 A October 28th. 9 Q 2016?

10 A 2016, right. 11 Q Thank you. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 13 Thank you. 14 Q Now, at some point after you signed this, did your 15 attorney Keith Davidson receive the $130,000? 17 Q And from that $130,000, did Keith Davidson and Gina 18 Rodriguez take fees for the deal? 19 A Yes. 20 Q And after they took their fees, did you end up with 21 approximately $96,000? 22 A Approximately, yes. 23 Q I would like to direct your attention now to 24 November 4th of 2016. 25 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's show People's 180 in 16 A Yes.

6 (Displayed.) 4 MS. HOFFINGER: And if we could just scroll over 5 to the date.

2692 1 evidence, please.

2 (Displayed.) 3 Q Do you recognize this article that came out in the Wall 4 Street Journal concerning the National Enquirer and Karen 5 McDougal? 6 A Yes. 7 Q Now, shortly before this article came out, did the Wall 8 Street Journal reporters reach out to you for a comment? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And did you respond to their request for comment? 11 A No. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please show Page 4 of this 13 exhibit, please. 14 I think it's Paragraph 4. 15 (Displayed.) 16 Q Can you read that? 17 A "An ABC spokesperson declined to comment on 18 Ms. McDougal or Ms. Clifford." 19 Q Actually, I think it's a different line. 20 MS. HOFFINGER: Maybe we could blow it up. 21 (Displayed.) 22 A Oh. 23 Q One moment. Do you see the last two sentences? The 24 last sentence? 25 A Yes.

2693 1 Q All right. Do you see that it says, "Ms. Clifford cut 2 off contact with the network without telling her story. She 3 didn't respond to requests for comment." 4 A Correct. 5 Q Did that confirm the fact that you declined for 6 comment? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And why didn't you comment for this article? 9 A Because I had an NDA.

10 Q And you were respecting the terms of that NDA? 11 A Yes. 12 Q And was Mr. Trump elected President approximately four 13 days after this article came out on November 8th, 2016? 14 A Yes. 15 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 16 Thank you. 17 Q So let me ask you, in 2017, briefly, what was your life 18 like in 2016, '17? 19 A The -- probably my best year ever. 20 I was writing and directing very successful films. I wrote 21 and directed one of the most expensive adult movies ever -- and 22 successful adult movies ever made especially by the company that 23 I worked for. 24 I finally won my Best Director Award. 25 My horse that I purchased in Ireland was ranked eighth in 2694 1 the country; that was a dream of mine.

2 My daughter was a straight A student. 3 I owned a house in Texas with really wonderful friends. 4 My neighbors in my neighborhood, they had no idea that they 5 lived next door to Stormy Daniels. 6 They just knew that I was --
7 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 9 A They just knew that they lived next to -- I won't say 10 my daughter's name -- mom. 11 And it was really good, actually.

12 Q And you continued to abide by the Non-disclosure 14 A Of course, yes.

15 Q And you did not say anything publicly about Mr. Trump 16 during that time; right?

17 A Right. Or privately.

18 Q Let me direct your attention now to January 10th of 19 2018.

20 Did you come to learn that the Wall Street Journal was 21 planning to write an article now about your experience with 22 Mr. Trump and the $130,000 payment? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And did they -- did the Wall Street Journal reach out 25 to you for comment?

8 THE COURT: Overruled.

13 Agreement?

2695 1 A Yes.

2 Q And did you comment? 3 A No. 4 Q Why not? 5 A Because I was under the NDA. I was respecting that and 6 didn't want to comment. 7 Q Let me show you now what's in evidence as People's 277. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: If you can put that up for 17 Q What is that?

18 A It is a statement that was sent to me from Keith 19 Davidson. 20 Q And Keith Davidson being your lawyer at the time? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And did you sign this statement? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Did you initially want to sign this? 25 A No.

9 everybody, please.

10 (Displayed.) 11 MS. HOFFINGER: If you can blow it up just a little 12 bit more. 13 Thank you. 14 (Displayed.) 15 Q Do you recognize that, Ms. Daniels? 16 A Yes.

2696 1 Q Were you happy just to stay quiet and not say 2 anything? 3 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the leading. 4 A Absolutely.

5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 Q Why did you not want to sign it originally?

7 A Because it's not true. And because I was told that 10 conversations with your attorney Keith Davidson, as a result of 11 his advice, did you agree and sign this, in fact?

12 A Yes. 13 Q Did you -- you said it was not entirely truthful; is 14 that right?

15 A Correct. 16 Q Now, would you say that it was cleverly misleading?

17 A Yes.

20 Q It was not true in several details; is that right? 21 A Correct.

22 Q And in some details, technically? 24 THE COURT: I didn't hear the question.

25 Q Was it in some details technically true?

19 THE COURT: Sustained. 18 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

23 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

8 saying anything at all, anything, was a violation of the NDA. 9 Q Okay. Without disclosing the substance of your 2697 1 A Yes.

2 Q Did you know at the time that Keith Davidson would be 3 getting this statement of yours to Michael Cohen? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Did you know that Michael Cohen would then be sending 6 it to the Wall Street Journal?

7 A Not specifically. 8 Q Okay. Did you later learn that when the Wall Street 9 Journal article came out?

10 A Yes. 11 Q What -- very briefly, what happened to your life when 12 this Wall Street Journal article came out on January -- in 13 January of 20 -- I'm sorry, withdrawn. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up People's 181 in 15 evidence. Just to be clear what we're talking about. 16 (Displayed.)
17 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you scroll up to the date of 18 this article at the top. 19 (Displayed.)
20 Q When this article came out in January, early January, 21 January 12th of 2018, did it have an impact on your life?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Briefly, what kind of impact did it have? 24 A Chaos. (Laughter.)
25 It was -- it suddenly -- I was front and foremost 2698 1 everywhere.

2 People on the front lawn. 3 My husband asking questions. 4 My friends asking questions. 5 And it blew my cover, I guess, for lack of a better way of 6 explaining it, to everyone that I rode horses with, everyone in 7 my neighborhood, everyone in my daughter's friends. 8 We were ostracized from her play groups, from the riding 9 stable, from horse shows, my -- her dad lost his -- like his gig 10 in his band. 11 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 12 THE COURT: Sustained. 13 Q I'm going to stop you. Thank you. 14 Let me ask you, after the Wall Street Journal article came 15 out, this article, did In Touch publish that article from back 16 in 2011 -- 17 A Yes.

18 Q -- that you had given a short interview? 19 A Yes. 20 Q And did you want that article out at that point? 21 A No. 22 Q And that article, when you first gave the interview, 23 were you supposed to have been paid for it? 24 A Yes. 25 Q And did you get paid in 2018 when they released it?

2699 1 A No.

2 Q After that, after this article came out, the In Touch 3 article came out, did Michael Cohen request of your attorney 4 that you go on the Hannity Show on Fox?

5 Were you aware of that? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And were you requested to go on Fox and to deny any 15 2018.

19 Q Were you scheduled on that day to go on the Jimmy 20 Kimmel show? 21 A Yes.

22 Q How did that come about? 23 A Gina set it up. 24 Q And what was the plan for what you were going to 25 discuss or not discuss on that show?

8 interactions you had with Mr. Trump? 9 A They asked me if I would be willing, yes.

10 Q And did you agree to do that? 11 A No.

12 Q Why not? 13 A Because I didn't want to. 14 Q Let me direct your attention now to January 30th of 16 Were you scheduled on that day --
17 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

18 Thank you.

2700 1 A Ummm, it was -- I was not to discuss the relationship 2 or NDA or anything like that. 3 It was to show that I was -- it was to give an example of 4 how I can go on and do promotions and things, but not break the 5 NDA. 6 Q And what happened shortly before you went on the 7 show? 8 A Gina came to my room with some dresses. They were for 9 me to try on to wear on the show, on loan from designers or 10 whatever. 11 And she came with a -- it was herself, somebody -- some 12 people I didn't recognize. And Keith Davidson. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: And let's put up, please, 14 People's 278 in evidence. 15 Thank you. 16 (Displayed.) 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Maybe just blow it up a little bit.

18 (Displayed.) 19 Q Do you recognize this? 20 A Yes. 21 Q What is this? 22 What do you recognize it to be? 23 A This is a statement that was handed to me in my hotel 24 room when I was in town to do the Jimmy Kimmel show by Keith 25 Davidson.

2701

1 Q And did you initially say no to signing this?

2 A Yes.
3 Q Without disclosing the substance of your conversations 4 with your attorney, Keith Davidson, as a result of his advice, 5 did you sign it? 6 A Yes. 7 Q How did you sign it? Did you sign it in a particular 8 way? 9 A I signed it Stormy Daniels, but I signed it not how my 10 Stormy Daniels signature looks any other time that I have ever 11 written it. 12 Q Why did you do that? 13 A As a tip off to Jimmy Kimmel. 14 Q What kind of a tip off? 15 A That I didn't -- that either I didn't sign it -- that I 16 didn't sign it willingly. 17 Q Is that because you were upset about signing it?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And is this statement false? 20 A Yes. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 22 Thank you. 23 Q Now, did there come a time in February of 2018 that you 24 became aware of Michael Cohen making certain public statements 25 about his paying you and --
2702 1 MS. NECHELES: Objection. Leading.

2 THE COURT: Sustained. 3 Q What, if anything, did you become aware of in February 4 of 2018 in terms of public statements made by Michael Cohen 5 about this -- these issues? 6 A Ummm, the articles and the quotes to journalists 7 started to have more details that they wouldn't have gotten 10 MS. NECHELES: Objection. 11 A I found out that he was shopping a book. 12 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the hearsay. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 Q Did you believe that some of what Michael Cohen was 16 A I'm not sure. 17 Q Well, did you believe that Michael Cohen was making 18 certain assertions about what did or didn't happen between 19 yourself and Mr. Trump? 20 Was he denying that you had an encounter with Mr. Trump? 21 A No. He was saying that I did. And he was -- he was 23 Q Okay. He was making certain public statements that 24 upset you; is that right? 25 A Yes.

15 saying publicly was not truthful?

8 unless they got it directly from somebody. And then I found out 9 that Michael Cohen was --
22 the fixer.

2703 1 Q And why was it upsetting to you?

2 A Because he could talk about it and I couldn't. 3 Q Around this time, did you -- around February of 2018, 4 did Michael Cohen try to prevent you from coming out and telling 5 the truth about what occurred? 6 A I'm not sure if it was Michael Cohen. 7 Q Okay. Did Michael Cohen file or have lawyers file a 8 Temporary Restraining Order against you in about February of 9 2018?

10 A Yes. 13 A It was to keep me from speaking or that I would be held 14 accountable for the million dollars that was mentioned in the 15 NDA. 16 Q Or -- 17 A Per episode.

18 Q And following -- around that time, after you were 19 served, around the time you were served with the Temporary 20 Restraining Order, did you hire another lawyer at that time? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And who did you hire? 23 A Michael Avenatti. 24 Q And did you hire him to try to get out of the NDA at 25 that point?

11 Q And can you just explain what your understanding was of 12 that Temporary Restraining Order?

2704 1 A Yes.

2 Q Why did you want to get out of the NDA at that point? 3 A So that I could stand up for myself. 4 Q Now, in about March, early March of 2018, did 5 Mr. Avenatti file a lawsuit in California against Donald Trump 6 and Michael Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, to try to 7 get you out of the NDA? 8 A Yes. 9 Q After your lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed that lawsuit 10 to get you out of the NDA, did you also go on 60 Minutes to 11 speak to Anderson Cooper? 12 A Yes. 13 Q Why did you do that? 14 A To get my story out. 15 Q And you did that even though there was a risk that you 16 could be held responsible for breach of the NDA? 17 A Yes.

18 Q Is it your understanding that by the Fall of 2018, 19 Mr. Trump and Michael Cohen agreed not to enforce that NDA that 20 you had signed? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And so, was it your understanding that you were then 23 legally free from the NDA so that you could speak publicly and 24 freely about who occurred? 25 A Yes.

2705 1 Q Was it your understanding that the Court in California 2 actually found that you were the prevailing party in that 3 suit to free you from the NDA and, therefore, awarded you legal 4 fees? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And were those legal fees -- did they total 7 approximately a little under a hundred thousand dollars? 8 A Yes, just under a hundred grand. 9 Q And after you were free from that NDA, as a result of 10 what we just discussed, did you publish a book? 11 A Yes. 12 Q What was the name of that book? 13 A "Full Disclosure." 14 Q And what is that book about? 15 A It's mostly about my life. It starts when I'm two 16 years old, actually, all the way up until, I believe, I think it 17 ends in June of 2018.

18 Q And did you include in the book some descriptions of 19 what happened with Mr. Trump? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Did you include in that book every detail of what 22 occurred in the room with Mr. Trump in his hotel, Harrah's? 23 A Not every detail, no. 24 Q Does the book also include some difficult experiences 25 that you had as a child?

2706 1 A Yes.

2 Q And did you disclose in the book, for the first time 3 publicly, some of those -- some of the details of what happened 4 to you as a child? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Was the book edited to some degree? 7 A Yes. 8 Q Who edited it? 9 A Two people. The person who helped me write it and edit 10 it for spelling and grammar, and fact checking was Kevin 11 O'Leary, who was hired by the publisher. 12 He mostly transcribed everything I wrote and did some 13 editing. 14 And then I found out later that Michael Avenatti did some 15 editing as well. 16 Q And did you earn some money from the publishing of that 17 book?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And that was your hard work in writing that book on -- 20 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 21 THE COURT: Sustained. 22 Q Was it your work on that book that you were paid for? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And aside from making money in publishing that book, 25 were there other reasons as well that you wrote that book?

2707 1 A Yes.

2 Q And what were those reasons, generally? 3 A Ummm, so that my daughter would have an account from 4 her mom's own words of what I had been through and --
20 Q Was the basis of that defamation claim about what 21 happened --
22 A Yeah. 23 Q -- in a parking lot?

25 Was the basis of that defamation claim -- withdrawn.

5 Q From the various aspects of your life; right? 6 A And the reasons why I did the things that I did.

7 Q Now, did there come a time in April of 2018 that your 8 then-lawyer, Michael Avenatti, also filed a defamation case on 9 your behalf against Donald Trump?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Did you want him to do that?

12 A No. 13 Q Why did you not want him to do that? 14 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

15 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 You can answer.

17 A It just seemed really risky. And it, it -- it didn't 18 seem like it was something that could be won. It seemed like a 19 bad choice. Not worth it, I guess.

24 Before you answer, just wait a minute.

2708 1 In April of 2018, did Mr. Avenatti release a sketch of the 2 man who you believed you had that encounter with in 2011? 3 A Yes.

17 A No.

18 Q What is your understanding about whether the Court in 19 that case made any finding with respect to your credibility 21 A There were none.

25 A Correct.

6 A Yes.

4 Q And in response to that sketch, did Mr. Trump tweet 5 that the sketch was essentially a con job?

7 Q And, to your understanding, was that defamation case 8 filed based only on that tweet about whether the sketch was a 9 con job?

10 A Yes, it was about the tweet. 11 Q Did the defamation claim have anything to do with 12 whether or not you were paid for the NDA before the election? 13 A No. 14 Q Did the claim of defamation have anything to do with 15 whether or not you had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump or any 16 other interactions with him? 20 whatsoever?

22 Q Is it your understanding that the Court determined in 23 that case that Mr. Trump was free to tweet "con job" because it 24 was what the Court called "rhetorical hyperbole?"
2709 1 Q And is that the reason, for something like just an 2 exaggeration? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And, as a result of that, the Court's finding was that 5 Mr. Trump was entitled to make that tweet, did the Courts in 6 California award Mr. Trump some legal fees?

7 A Yes. 8 Q Just as they had awarded you legal fees earlier -- 9 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the leading, your 10 Honor. 11 THE COURT: Sustained.

12 Q Is Michael Avenatti still your lawyer? 13 A No. 14 Q Why is he not -- why is he not still your lawyer?

15 MS. NECHELES: Objection, relevance. 16 THE COURT: Overruled.

17 You can answer.

18 A Because I fired him. And then later he was found 19 guilty of stealing from not just myself, but from several 20 clients, and he was disbarred and is in prison. 21 Q Was he found guilty in the criminal case in which you 22 testified? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And were you cross-examined in that case?

25 A Yes.

2710 1 Q And the result was that he was found guilty?

2 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 MS. NECHELES: Move to strike that.

5 THE COURT: The answer is stricken. 6 Q Have you, as a result of the Court in the defamation 18 A No.

17 case?

15 Q And have you paid, yet, all of the legal fees that the 16 Court said that you owe Mr. Trump as a result of the defamation 19 Q Why not?

20 A Uhhh, I'm sorry. 21 What was that?

22 Q Why haven't you paid those yet? 23 A Because I don't have the means to pay that kind of 24 funds and because I didn't think it was fair.

25 Q Now, in July of 2023, did Mr. Trump file a proceeding 8 awarded some legal fees in the NDA case, were some of those 9 offset against each other so that you actually paid off some of 10 those legal fees that the Court said that you owed Mr. Trump? 11 MS. NECHELES: Objection to leading, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: I will allow it. 13 You can answer. 14 A Yes.

7 case awarding Donald Trump some legal fees and your being 2711 1 in Florida to recover those additional legal fees?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And do you have a lawyer assisting you with those 4 proceedings? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And is one of those lawyers here in court with you 7 today? 8 A Yes. 9 Q What is your understanding about whether the outcome of 10 this case will have anything to do with the outcome of that 11 proceeding about the legal fees? 12 A It won't. 13 Q So is there any relation whatsoever to your 14 understanding? 15 A No. 16 Q Let me direct your attention now to February of 2021. 17 Did you agree or -- and go on and participate in Michael Cohen's 18 Podcast at that time? 19 A Yes. 20 Q Why did you agree to do that? 21 A Because I wanted him to apologize to me. 22 Q And did he apologize to you on that Podcast? 23 A He did. 24 Q Was that the first time you had ever spoken to him? 25 A Yes.

2712 1 Q And, generally, on that Podcast, did you discuss a 2 variety of things? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Including your encounters with Mr. Trump? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And did you agree to go on another Podcast of 7 Mr. Cohen's in January of 2022? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And, generally, why did you go on again?

10 A Ummm, because we had a good rapport and this time 11 around he wanted to ask specifics about -- as to the Michael 13 Q And is that generally what -- mostly what you discussed 14 on that? 15 A On the second Podcast, yes. 16 Q Now, you mentioned earlier that you were featured in a 17 documentary; is that right?

18 A Correct. 19 Q And what was it called? 20 A Stormy. 21 Q And what was it about, generally? 22 A Ummm, the same as the book. It was generally about my 24 Q Did it also include information about your experiences 25 with Mr. Trump?

12 Avenatti case.

23 life, focusing more on, ummm, the two years of 2018 and '19.

2713 1 A Yes.

2 Q And were you paid to appear or participate in the 3 documentary? 4 A No. 7 rights to your materials and your book? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And how much of that have you been paid so far?

10 A A hundred thousand. 11 Q And is that the sum total of money that you had 12 received or will receive from that documentary? 17 documentary?

18 A Yes. 19 Q What was that, generally?

20 A To get the truth out. The same as the book. To have 21 an updated account.

22 Q Did you first start on that documentary some years 23 ago? 24 A Yes, in 2018.

25 Q And was that well before we gave you a subpoena to 5 Q While not paid to appear or participate in it, did the 6 production company agree to pay you $125,000 for the licensing 14 Q Now, in addition to the money that you received in 15 connection with that documentary, "that" meaning the licensing 16 rights, was there another reason that you agreed to do the 13 A Yes.

2714 1 testify in this case?

2 A Yes. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up People's 408A 4 in evidence. 5 (Displayed.) 6 ********** 7 Q First, I'm going to ask you, on March 15th of 2023, did 8 you participate in an interview by Zoom with members of our 9 office?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And I'm showing you -- we are showing you now what's in 12 evidence as People's Exhibit 408A. 13 What is the date of this -- well, first of all, do you 14 recognize this? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Do you recognize @realDonaldTrump to be Mr. Trump's 17 Truth Social account?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And did you recognize that to be his Truth Social 20 account at the time, which is March 2023? 21 A Yes. 22 Q What's the date on this Truth Social post? 23 A March 15th, 2023. 24 Q And were you aware of this post when it came out, when 25 Mr. Trump released it?

2715 1 A The next morning, yes.

2 Q Can you read it for us, please? 3 MS. HOFFINGER: Maybe you might want to make it a 4 little bit bigger, if it's possible. 5 (Displayed.) 6 A I can see it. I'm good. 7 "I did nothing wrong in the 'Horseface' case. I see she 8 showed up in New York today trying to drum up some publicity for 9 herself. I haven't seen or spoken to her since I took a picture 10 with her on a golf course in full golf gear including a hat 11 close to 18 years ago." 12 "She knows nothing about me other than her con man lawyer 13 Avenatti and convicted liar and felon jailbird Michael Cohen may 14 have schemed up." 15 "Never had an affair with her." 16 "Just another false acquisition by a 'SleazeBag.'" 17 That's a typo, I guess, "by Sleazebag." Period.

18 "Witch Hunt!" Exclamation point. 19 Q Who did you understand Mr. Trump to be referring to as 20 "Horseface" and "SleazeBag" in this post? 21 A Me. 22 Q Had he called you "Horseface" publicly before?

23 A Yes. 24 Q And has he also called you "SleazeBag" publicly
25 before?

2716 1 A Yes.

2 Q Has he called you "SleazeBag" since this post? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Is Mr. Trump's statement in this Truth Social post, 5 that he hasn't seen or spoken to you since he took a picture 6 with you on the golf course; is that true or false? 7 A False. 8 Q Why is it false? 9 A Because I met with him numerous times after that and 10 spoke to him on the phone countless times. 11 Q So, in other words, the times that you described here? 12 A (Shaking head.) 13 Q In his hotel room; the next day at Trump Tower; at the 14 Les Deux in LA, and this is a LA hotel; in addition to -- 15 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the leading, your 17 A Yes.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. 19 (Whereupon, at this time, Laurie Eisenberg relieved 20 Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.) 21 ********** 22 23 24 25 16 Honor.

2717 1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, may we approach for a 3 moment? 4 THE COURT: Sure.

5 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 6 at sidebar:)
7 MS. HOFFINGER: I just want to be inordinately 8 careful. 9 I'm about to ask what the effect, if any, it had 10 on her. 11 You previously ruled we are allowed to elicit 12 information from subjects from these Truths or Tweets. 13 THE COURT: What is the answer you expect? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: It was frightening for her, she 15 didn't feel good about it, and I'm sure it had a chilling 16 effect.

17 MS. NECHELES: Is that it? Or is she going to 18 talk about threats made to her or things like that? 19 MS. HOFFINGER: I'll ask generally what affect it 20 had on her, seeing this. 21 MS. NECHELES: Judge, we can't un-ring it if she 22 comes out and says that. 23 THE COURT: I agree. 24 I think -- given the discussion we had earlier, I
25 think it's best to stay away from that.

2718 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Will do.

2 That's why I asked to approach. 3 THE COURT: Thank you. 4 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 5 in open court:) 6 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

7 I have no further questions. 9 Your witness.

10 MS. NECHELES: Thank you. 11 THE COURT: You may inquire.

12 MS. NECHELES: Thank you, your Honor. 13 CROSS-EXAMINATION 14 BY MS. NECHELES:
15 Q Good afternoon, Ms. Daniels. 16 My name is Susan Necheles.

17 You and I have never spoken before; right?

18 A Correct. 19 Q And I represent President Trump.

20 So, even though we've never spoken, you've met with the 21 prosecutors on a number of occasions; right?

22 A Correct. 23 Q And you rehearsed your testimony here; right? 24 A No.

25 Q Well, according to you, the prosecutors subjected you 8 THE COURT: Thank you.

2719 1 to "several grueling prep sessions, which included brutal mock 2 cross-examinations"; correct? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And that -- and you say that that's not rehearsing 5 your testimony? 6 A It is not rehearsing my testimony.

7 Q But, you pretended to be being cross-examined; right? 8 A My testimony was not rehearsed. 9 Q That was not my question.

10 Do you want me to repeat my question? 11 A Yes, please.

12 Q Okay. 13 You pretended to be cross-examined; didn't you? 14 A Um, no.

15 Q Well, when you said that -- just now, you agreed that 16 you were subjected to "grueling prep sessions, which included 17 brutal mock cross-examination".

18 "Mock cross-examination" means that they had someone who 19 pretended to be cross-examining you; right?

20 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 21 THE COURT: Overruled.

22 You can answer. 23 A There were a lot of parts. Which part would you like 24 me to answer first?

25 Q Okay.

2720 1 Is it correct that you had mock cross-examination done?

2 A I was asked questions as they would, perhaps, be asked
3 by the Court. 4 Q But, you said on a previous occasion that you had 5 "mock cross-examination" done to you -- 6 A I used the wrong word. "Mock" is not the correct term 7 now that I'm in court. 8 Q So, when you said that before, you were not being 9 truthful?

10 A I was incorrect. I did not know what true court would 11 be like.

12 Q But, they asked you questions as if you were being 14 A Not exactly, no.

15 Q And it was, you said, "brutal sessions", right, 16 "grueling sessions", right?

17 A True.

18 Q And they were "pushing you"; right? 19 A The memories were hard to bring up, yes. They were 20 painful. 21 Q And they wanted to make sure that when you came into 22 court, you were able to present a good appearance; right? 23 A The -- that I wouldn't be too upset. 24 Q And that you would be ready for cross-exam; right?

25 A No. I don't think so.
13 cross-examined; right?

2721 1 Q Okay.

2 So, when you said "mock cross-examinations", it wasn't to 3 get you ready for cross-exam? 4 A (No response).

5 Q Right? Is that what you're saying? 6 A It was to have all of the facts. They wanted to ask, 7 to have as much information as possible. 8 Q And the prosecutors began your direct testimony today 9 by asking you why you started acting in pornography; right?

20 right? 21 A To get a pay increase for my dancing, yes.

22 Q That motivates you a lot in life, making more money; 23 right? 24 A Well, it is the United -- that's what we do here.

25 (Shrugs).

10 Do you remember that happening this morning? 11 A They asked me why?

12 Q Yes. 13 A I don't think they asked me why. 14 Q Well, do you recall testifying that you started acting 15 in pornography because you wanted to make more money; right? 16 A Correct.

17 Q And it's that simple, you wanted more money; right?

18 A Don't we all want to make more money in our jobs? 19 Q And that is why you started acting in pornography; 2722

1 Q Am I correct that you hate President Trump?

2 A Yes.
3 Q And you want him to go to jail; right? 4 A I want him to be held accountable.

5 Q You want him to go to jail; am I correct? 6 A If he is found guilty, absolutely.

7 Q And you Tweeted in the past that: "I won't walk, I'll 8 dance down the street when he's selected to go to jail;" 9 correct?

12 MS. NECHELES: Can we please pull up J-2 right 13 now, only for the witness and the parties, please.

16 Q Is that your tweet?

17 A Uh-huh. (Laughs).

18 Q Did you just laugh? 19 A Selected is in quotes because I am quoting something 20 that someone else said. Because I knew that you don't get 21 selected to go to jail.

22 Q You just laughed about that; right? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 24 A It is a typo.

25 THE COURT: Overruled.

14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 15 and the parties' screens.)
10 A Can you show me that's exactly what I said? That's 11 not --
2723 1 A That's why it is funny. You don't get selected to go 2 to jail. 3 Q It's not because you think this is all funny? 4 A No. Absolutely not.

5 Q When you say -- so -- and that, in fact, is what you 6 tweeted; right?

7 A Yes. I am quoting another tweet. 8 Q You are quoting the word "selected"; right? 9 A Correct.

10 Q And everything else is your words; right? 11 A Correct.

12 Q Your words: "I won't walk, I'll dance down the street 13 when he's", quote, "selected", end quote, "to go to jail"?

15 Q And, part of the reason you hate him is because he 16 won a legal case against you and you owe him, today, over 17 half-a-million-dollars; right?

18 A He didn't win the case. 19 He won attorney's fees because I was not allowed to go to 20 trial. Court. Sorry. 21 Q You're suing him for defamation; right?

22 A Yes. 23 Q But, your lawsuit was dismissed by the court, Federal 25 A Right. So it was not lost. It was dismissed.

14 A Correct.

24 Court in California; right?

1 Q It was dismissed.

2724 2 That means he won the case; right? 3 A He was prevailed, but I was not found to have lost. 4 Q So, the prevailing part is the winning; right?

6 Q So, you agree with me, he won the case, and he was 19 Q If you look in the top, you see --
20 A I see it. 21 Q You recognize that to be the Order; correct?

22 A Yes, ma'am. 23 I just wasn't sure of the exact date. 24 MS. NECHELES: I offer that in evidence.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

7 awarded over half-a-million-dollars in legal fees; right? 8 A Correct. 9 Q In fact, there were three awards for legal fees on his 10 part; right? 11 A Correct.

12 Q First, on December 11th, 2018, you were ordered to pay 13 $293,052.33; correct? 14 A I'm not sure of the exact dates.

15 Q Can I show you what's being marked exhibit J-4. 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 17 and the parties' screens.)
18 A Okay.

5 A Right.

2725 2 Q That was from October 15th; right? 3 A I'm not sure. 4 Q Well, you see the date on it?

5 A It says "December". 6 Q I'm sorry.

7 J4, correct, occurred on December 11th; correct? 8 A Correct. 9 Q And then you appealed that Order and lost; right?

10 A Correct. 11 Q And you then had to pay attorney's fees for the 12 appeal; right? 13 A Correct. 14 Q And that occurred on March 30, 2022; correct?

15 A I don't know the date. 16 MS. NECHELES: Okay.

17 Can we show her what's been marked as Defendant's 18 J-5. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 20 and the parties' screens.) 21 Q That was March 30, 2022?

22 A Yes, ma'am. 23 Q And on that date, you were ordered to pay an 24 additional $245,209.67 to President Trump; right?

25 A Sorry.

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2726 1 It says -- it's not on this page.

2 MS. NECHELES: Can you turn to the last paragraph 3 for the witness, please, on Page 10. 4 A Yes, ma'am.

5 Q Yet, you appealed again; right? 6 A Correct.

7 Q And you lost that again; right? 9 Q And you were ordered on April 4, 2023 to pay an 11 A Same.

12 Could you please show it to me? 13 Q Sure. 14 MS. NECHELES: Can we show the witness and the 15 parties what has been marked as Defendant's Exhibit J-6. 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 17 and the parties' screens.)
18 Q Correct? 19 A Yes, ma'am.

20 Q That was on April 4, 2023? 21 A Correct.

22 Q So, in total, because of your frivolous litigation 23 against President Trump -- 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

10 additional $121,972.56; correct?

8 A Correct.

2727 1 Q Because of your cases that you brought that were 2 dismissed against President Trump, courts have awarded 3 President Trump over $660,000 in attorney's fees; correct? 4 A Roughly, yes. 7 A Yes.

15 Q And California, you know, has 10 percent annual 19 correct?

20 A Correct. 21 Q And, you testified -- on direct you were asked, as a 22 result of the offset, you have paid some of the legal fees; 23 right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q But, you didn't pay anything out of your pocket; did 8 Q In a different case? 9 A (Nods yes).

10 Q So, the total amount in attorney's fees, alone, was 11 approximately $560,000 that you owe to President Trump; right?

12 A About. 13 Q And that's before interest; right? 14 A I would assume yes.

16 interest on this; right?

17 A I did not know.

18 Q And some of these have been pending since 2018; 5 Q And then you testified that was set aside by -- offset 6 by about a hundred thousand dollars in attorney's fees?

2728 1 you?

2 A (No response). 3 Q You didn't take any money out of your pocket and pay 4 it to Donald Trump; did you?

14 Q In fact, you have not taken one penny out of your 15 pocket to pay these awards; right? 16 A Right.

17 Q And you said on direct it's because you can't afford 18 it; right? 19 A Right.

20 Q But, you have money; right? 21 A We all have money.

22 Q It's because you're choosing not to pay him one penny, 23 President Trump; right? 24 A (Pause). We all have -- I don't understand the 25 question.

10 Q Sure. 11 You didn't take any money out of your pocket and pay 12 President Trump; did you? 13 A No.

5 MS. HOFFINGER: Object to defense counsel's 7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 Please allow her to answer. 9 A Sorry. Can I hear the question again?

6 voice.

2729 1 Q Well, you've chosen to disobey the Court Order; right?

2 A I have chosen not to make a payment while it's still 3 pending, yes. 4 Q You have announced publicly that you will never pay 5 President Trump the money that you owe him; right? 6 A Right.

9 will go to jail before I pay a penny;" correct?

10 A Correct. 11 Q And, I show you what has been marked as Exhibit J-7.

12 MS. NECHELES: We can just show that to the 13 witness, the parties, and the Court. 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 15 and the parties' screens.) 16 Q You recognize that as your tweet?

17 A Yep.

18 MS. NECHELES: I offer that in evidence. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

20 THE COURT: Sustained. 21 MS. NECHELES: Prior evidence applies.

22 THE COURT: Approach. 23 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 24 at sidebar:)
25 MS. HOFFINGER: She's admitted each of these.

7 Q In fact, the day after the Federal Court of Appeals 8 ordered you to pay President Trump $245,000, you tweeted: "I
2730 1 THE COURT: She admitted it.

2 MS. NECHELES: It's not coming in as a prior 3 inconsistent statement alone. It's not coming in as that. 4 It's prior evidence of bias, which is admissible 5 to show bias and motive. 6 MS. HOFFINGER: You've excluded any exhibits to 7 be admitted by them on cross.

19 Q Is that your Twitter handle?

20 A Yes. 21 Q @StormyDaniels?

22 A Yes. 23 Q And that was your tweet on March 21, 2022; right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q And that was right when the Court of Appeals had 9 THE COURT: That's not correct.

10 I'll allow it. 11 MS. NECHELES: Thank you.

12 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 13 in open court:) 14 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

15 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-7 is received in 16 evidence.)

18 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
8 MS. NECHELES: No.

2731 1 ordered you to pay money; right?

2 A Roughly, yes. 3 Q And that was you saying: I don't care about a Federal 4 Court Order; right?

5 A That is me saying that I will not pay for telling the 6 truth.

7 Q Well, it was a Federal Court Order, you understood; 15 Q Ms. Daniels, you understand that there's no question 16 standing; right?

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Sustained.

14 A My motivation was because I was telling the truth. 13 Q Well -- 12 A That's not what I was responding to.

11 You can answer. 10 THE COURT: Overruled.

9 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. Asked and answered. 8 right?

20 Can you ask the witness to respond? 21 THE COURT: Sure.

22 Please wait until there's a question, and then 24 THE WITNESS: Okay.

25 Q But, you don't care about the Court Order; do you?

19 MS. NECHELES: You're correct.

23 you can answer the question.

2732 1 A Of course I care.

2 Q So, even though there's three Court Orders ordering 3 you to pay President Trump, you are not going to do that; 4 right?

5 A I don't know. 6 Q Well, isn't it correct -- well, let me show you what 7 has been marked as J-1 for the witness and the parties. 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 9 and the parties' screens.)
10 Q Do you recognize that -- 11 A Yep.

12 Q -- as a tweet by you? 13 A Yep. 14 MS. NECHELES: I offer that in evidence, your 15 Honor. 16 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

17 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-1 is received in 18 evidence.) 19 MS. NECHELES: We can show it to everybody.

20 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.) 21 Q Again, that's you -- your tweet; right?

22 A Correct. 23 Q And it's you, again, saying: "I don't owe him shit and 24 I'll never give that orange turd a dime;" right?

25 A Correct.

2733

1 Q And that's you calling President Trump names; right?

2 A In retaliation for what he said to me, yes.
3 Q And that's you making fun of how he looks; right? 4 A Correct.

5 Q So, when you were asked on your direct examination if 6 he called you Horseface, you call him names all the time; 7 right? 9 Q You despise him, and you made fun of how he looks; 10 right? 11 A Because he made fun of me first.

12 Q So, one of you started it, but you both continue it; 13 right? 14 A Correct.

15 Q But, in any case, you also have vowed that you will 19 Q To be clear, at the time that you made this tweet, 20 there were already three Federal Court Orders -- 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

22 Q -- or two ordering you to pay money; right? 23 THE COURT: Sustained. 24 Q Now, you know that debtors are required to fill out a 25 form under penalty of perjury disclosing their accounts; right?

16 never give him a dime; right?

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. Asked and answered.

18 THE COURT: Sustained.

8 A Yes.

1 A Yes.

2 Q You testified on the record there is a case in Florida 3 against you by Donald Trump trying to collect money; right? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And you're required to fill out that form; right? 6 A Yes.

11 Jeff Toobin where you said you were not gonna fill out that 18 Q Did you give an interview to Jeff Toobin where you 19 said you were not going to fill out the form?

20 A I didn't -- 21 THE COURT: Why don't you start again.

22 MS. NECHELES: Thank you. 23 Q Do you recall giving an interview to Jeff Toobin where 24 you said you would not fill out that form?

25 A Yes.

2734 7 Q And you have totally refused to fill out that form for 8 ages; correct? 9 A False.

10 Q Well, am I correct that you gave an interview with 12 form? 13 A It has been filled out, to my knowledge. 14 You'd have to ask my attorney.

15 Q Did you understand the question? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: She answered the question.

17 THE COURT: She did.

2735 1 Q And your lawyer was asking you to fill out the form, 2 and you said, "I'm fully prepared to go to jail before doing 3 this;" right? 4 A Correct.

5 They were asking for questions about my daughter on that 6 form.

7 Q Well, the form asked your daughter's name in one 8 place; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q But, other than that, the form is entirely only about 11 your assets; right?

12 A (Shrugs). I don't remember. 13 My attorney sent it to me. 14 Q Okay.

15 Well -- now you say you filled out the form; right? 16 A Filled out parts of it. My attorney did it for me.

17 Q Let me show you what has been marked as J-10A. J-10A.

18 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 19 and the parties' screens.)
20 Q Do you recognize that as the form? 21 A It was an email from my attorney. So, I think so. I'm 22 not sure. 23 Q We can turn to page -- turn to the next page, J-10B. 24 (Whereupon, Counsel confer.)
25 Q And -- if we turn to Page 3 of that, you see that's a 2736 1 Fact and Information Sheet for you?

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 3 and the parties' screens.) 4 A Yes.

10 Q Well, let me ask you, you only partially filled this 11 form out; right?

18 at sidebar:) 19 MS. HOFFINGER: We are getting way down the road 20 now in that case. 21 Now, I understand they opened the door on bias 22 concerning the legal fees, and there's been a lot of 23 testimony elicited. 24 But, at this point, this is entirely collateral.

25 THE COURT: I agree.

8 THE WITNESS: (Whispering to the Court) This has 9 my address.

13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 MS. NECHELES: Can I approach?

15 THE WITNESS: (Whispering to the Court) That's 16 got my address.

17 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 7 THE COURT: Sustained.

6 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 5 MS. NECHELES: I offer this in evidence.

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

1 I allowed you to introduce one or two other 2 pieces of evidence that really are collateral. I allowed 3 you to introduce them.

5 MS. NECHELES: I don't need to put it in. 6 I just want to question her about: She lied about 7 her assets and is trying to hide her assets. 8 THE COURT: Okay. 9 MS. NECHELES: That's all I wanted the document 10 for. 11 THE COURT: She turned to me, she looked very 12 fearful, and she said, "That's got my address." 13 You asked to approach, and she said, "That's got 14 my address."
15 She is very much afraid of this form. 16 Ask the questions you want to ask her.

17 MS. NECHELES: I would block off the address.

18 THE COURT: I can appreciate that. 19 MS. NECHELES: We don't need to put that in.

20 I want to ask her about lying about the form. 21 THE COURT: You can ask her, sure.

22 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 23 in open court:) 24 Q Ms. Daniels, if you could turn your attention --
25 MS. NECHELES: If we can show for the witness and 2737 4 I don't see why you need this.

2738 1 the parties only Page --
4 Q Well, just to be clear, this is a Fact Information 5 Sheet having to do with you; correct? 6 A Yes.

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 3 and the parties' screens.) 7 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, may we approach? 8 THE COURT: Take that down, please. 9 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 10 at sidebar:) 11 THE COURT: You're not offering that into 12 evidence -- it's being shown to the parties -- because 13 she's very much afraid of your client seeing that address. 14 That's what I was communicating to you before.

15 Why don't you just ask her questions about the 16 form.

17 MS. NECHELES: I was going to turn to a different 18 page. 19 I wanted to ask her and wanted to see, she says 20 she has no money in her bank account. 21 THE COURT: Why don't you ask her first.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: This is an unsigned form. I 23 don't know what we're asking about. There is no signature 24 on this form.

25 She's not entitled to ask her about a form that's 2739 1 got information that is not signed by anybody.

4 Trump's lawyer.

5 MS. HOFFINGER: You can look at it. 6 THE COURT: It got filed with the Court?

7 MS. NECHELES: It doesn't get filed, is my 8 understanding. 9 It's not signed.

10 THE COURT: Can I see the form? 11 MS. NECHELES: Yes.

12 MS. HOFFINGER: It's entirely unsigned. 13 (Whereupon, Ms. Necheles hands documents to the 14 Court.)
15 THE COURT: This is the entire form? 16 MS. NECHELES: Yes.

17 At least, that's the entire form I received.

18 (Whereupon, the Court reviews the documents.) 19 THE COURT: Where is it signed?

20 MS. HOFFINGER: It's not signed. 21 MS. NECHELES: It's not signed.

2 THE COURT: Has this form been filed? 3 MS. NECHELES: Her lawyer sent it to President 22 I was going to ask her: She's been delaying, she 23 won't fill out the form for three years, four years.

25 That was her testimony.

24 She just said: No, I had it filled out.

2740 1 THE COURT: Here's what we can do. You can hand 2 it to her instead of putting it up. You can just ask her 3 questions. 4 And you can redirect and ask her if this form is 5 signed or not. 6 MS. NECHELES: Her lawyer sent it to Donald 7 Trump's lawyer. 9 THE COURT: That's why you can question her.

10 MS. NECHELES: It's a concern he'll know her 11 address.

12 It was sent to her -- 13 THE COURT: I am not going to get into this 14 discussion.

15 You can hand this up to the witness. 16 (Whereupon, the Court returns the documents to 17 Ms. Necheles.)
18 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 19 in open court:)
20 THE COURT: Are you handing that up to the 21 witness?

22 MS. NECHELES: Yes. 23 Thank you, your Honor. 24 Q I'm handing you up what has been marked as Defense 25 J-10A.

8 I understand her concerns.

2741 1 (Whereupon, the exhibit is handed to the witness 2 by the court officer.) 3 Q That's the document we've been talking about; right? 4 A Yes.

5 Q That's the document you said -- you testified that you 6 had filled out; right?

10 Q You said it was no longer true that you were refusing 11 to fill out this form; right?

12 A Yes. 13 Q So, this form has been partially filled out; right?

15 Q And if we turn to Page 3 -- Page 3, it asks about your 16 spouse's income; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And you say that's "unknown"; right? 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

20 Reading from a document. 21 THE COURT: I'm sorry.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 23 THE COURT: What's the objection?

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

24 MS. HOFFINGER: It's not in evidence.

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 8 I don't believe that was the testimony. 9 THE COURT: Sustained.

14 A Correct.

2742 1 Q Well, when you filled out this form, you did not give 2 your spouse's income; right? 3 A I won't fill out information that endangers my family 4 or my daughter, no matter what. (Nods no).

5 Q I'm asking about your spouse's income; right? 6 A Right.

8 A Right. 9 Q It asks about what cars you own or are buying; right?

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 11 THE COURT: Sustained.

12 Q You also refused to give that information; right? 13 A That's -- 14 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the documents.)
15 A Oh. Actually, that was on there. So, yeah. 16 Q And you said you have no bank accounts; right?

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 That was not the testimony. 19 THE COURT: Why don't you just ask her: Does she 20 have bank accounts. 21 Q Do you have bank accounts?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Did you tell that on the form, the form that you're 24 required to fill out disclosing that information?

25 A I didn't fill out this form.

7 Q And you did not fill out your spouse's income; right?

2743 1 Q You didn't fill it out.

2 You're still refusing to provide that information; aren't 3 you? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

6 Q Well, have you provided the information you're 7 required under law to provide so that President Trump can 8 collect on the judgments from you?

11 Q And you refused to sign the form as well; right?

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 13 THE COURT: Overruled. 14 You can answer.

15 A I have not filled out -- I haven't been given the form 16 to sign.

17 It went to my attorney. He has not returned it to me to 18 sign. 19 Q Didn't you testify a few minutes ago it came to your 20 email? 21 A From my attorney.

22 He has not filled it out. 23 Q And now, you, in fact, own a home; don't you? 24 A No, I do not.

25 Q Well, isn't it a fact that in 2022, you tweeted that 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Sustained.

5 THE COURT: Sustained.

2744 1 you had earned so much money from making pornography that you 2 had just paid for your new ranch home? 3 A I did tweet that, but I didn't own a home, and I do 4 not own a home.

5 Q So, when you tweeted that, that was false? 6 A We did not end up buying that house.

7 Q And, am I correct that at that time you said you made 8 a million dollars in a book deal and in The Surreal Life, and 9 you're just doing the same job you've always done and love 10 doing, and that you just paid for your new ranch home? 11 A I would have to see the tweet.

12 Q Okay. 13 MS. NECHELES: We can pull up J-17. 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 15 and the parties' screens.) 16 Q Isn't that correct, you said you just made a million 17 dollars?

18 A I said I have made a million.

21 A Yes.

22 Q And that was on December 11th, 2022; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q So, was that a lie?

25 A I pay rent at a ranch. I didn't say I purchased it.

19 Q And you said: "I just paid" -- you said: "I just paid 20 for my new ranch;" right?

2745 1 Q Is that what you meant when you tweeted to the world 2 that you just paid for your new ranch, that you were paying 3 rent? 4 A Yes.

5 Q With a million dollars? 6 A (Nods yes).

9 A No.

10 Q Didn't you set up a Trust in the name of your 11 daughter?

12 A Nope. 13 Q And isn't it true that you are hoping that if Donald 16 A I hope I don't have to pay him no matter what happens.

17 Q Now, while you've been refusing to pay President Trump 18 the money that you owe him, you've also been making money by 19 claiming that you had sex with President Trump; right?

20 A Are you talking about the book? Yes. 21 Q And, you've been making money by claiming you had sex 22 with Donald Trump for more than a decade; right? 23 A I have not been paid for interviews in the United 24 States if that's what you mean.

25 Q Well, that was not my question.

7 Q Isn't it true that you have been hiding your assets 8 because you don't want to pay the judgment against you?

14 Trump is convicted, you'll never have to pay him the more than 15 half-a-million-dollars you owe him?

2746 1 My question was, you've been making money by claiming to 2 have had sex with President Trump for more than a decade; 3 right?

11 Q Now, just going back, isn't it a fact that before you 12 started making money off of claiming you had sex, you were 13 denying that you had sex with President Trump; right? 14 A Because of the NDA, yes.

15 Q The NDA was signed in 2016; right? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Isn't it a fact that in 2011, you spoke with a 18 prominent lawyer named Gloria Allred about whether you could 19 sue President Trump for money; right?

22 But I also told her that I had sex with Donald Trump. 23 Q You claim you told her you had sex with Donald Trump; 24 is that what you're saying?

25 A Yes.

4 A I have been making money by telling my story about 5 what happened to me. 6 Q And that story, in essence, is that you say you had 7 sex with President Trump; right? 9 Q And that story has made you a lot of money; right?

10 A It has also cost me a lot of money.

20 A I don't remember what was talked about in that 21 conversation.

8 A Yes.

2747 1 Q Do you remember writing a book called Full Disclosure?

2 A Yes.
3 Q I show you what has been marked as Exhibit J-11.

20 Q That's the cover of the book you wrote; right? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And you stated in this book that Gina Rodriguez 23 arranged a phone call between you and Gloria Allred to tell 24 your story; right?

25 A Correct.

4 MS. NECHELES: That's just for the witness, and 5 the parties, and the Court, please. 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 7 and the parties' screens.) 8 Q You recognize that as the book that you wrote? 9 A Yes.

10 Q It's called Full Disclosure; correct? 11 A Yes.

12 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, if we could just put 13 that in evidence, just the picture of the cover, not the 14 book.

15 THE COURT: I'll allow it. 16 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-11 is received in 17 evidence.)
18 MS. NECHELES: We can show that to everybody. 19 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
1 Q Who is Gina Rodriguez?

2748 2 A She is a talent manager. 3 Q She was someone who helped you on several occasions to 6 Q In 2011, she arranged for you to speak with Gloria 7 Allred; right?

19 Q Okay.

20 And, in this -- in fact, you told Gloria -- you had a phone 21 call with Gloria Allred?

22 A Correct. 23 Q You described to Gloria Allred your story about 24 President Trump; right?

25 A Yes.

8 A Yes. 9 Q Who is Gloria Allred?

10 A She's an attorney. 11 Q She's a prominent attorney who has represented lots of 12 women who have made money from men by threatening to sue them; 13 right? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

15 THE COURT: Overruled. 16 Q Is that correct?

17 A Yes.

18 I actually turned down her offer.

4 sell your story; right?

5 A Correct.

2749 1 Q And you told Gloria Allred that you did not have sex 2 with President Trump; didn't you? 3 A No. I did not say that. I told her that I did. 4 Q I want to direct your attention to Page 194 of Exhibit 5 J-11G, which we'll show just to the parties and the witness. 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 7 and the parties' screens.) 8 Q Okay. 9 MS. NECHELES: If we could blow up for the 10 witness where it starts with "I barreled", that paragraph. 11 Q You see that?

16 extremely abbreviated version of your interactions, leaving out 17 sex; right?

18 A Yes. During that phone conversation. 19 When I met her in person later, I told her everything.

20 Q All right. 21 I'm talking about what you wrote in your book.

22 This is your book; right? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 24 THE COURT: Overruled.

25 Q This is your book; right?

12 You can read it to yourself where it starts off with "I 13 barreled". 14 Am I correct that you told -- you had a conversation, and 15 you said in a prior statement that you gave Gloria Allred an 1 A Yes.

2 Q And in your book, you said that you left out sex and 3 anything in the least bit interesting; right? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And then Ms. Allred asked you, "Is there anything 6 else?"; right?

7 A (No response). 8 Q Right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And you said, "No;" right? 11 A Right.

12 Q And then she said, "Well, I can't do anything else for 13 you if that's all there is;" right? 14 A Correct.

15 Q And, you say -- you wrote: "I hung up, and that was 16 that;" right?

17 A Correct.

18 I did not tell her all the sex details. I did not trust 19 her.

20 And she wanted me to accuse him of forced -- basically 21 rape, and so I did not continue that conversation.

22 Q None of that is in your book; is it? 23 A No.

25 You're making this up as you sit there; right?

2750 24 Q Right?

1 A No.

2751 2 Q Well, you wrote a whole book, and you specifically 3 describe that encounter, and you didn't say anything like you 4 just said; right?

5 A Which is why I said it's an abbreviated version of my 6 interaction, leaving out the sex part.

7 I'm pretty sure that backs up my story. 8 Q You said it's an abbreviated version of your 9 interaction with Donald Trump; right?

10 A "Abbreviated" means I left out all of the details, 11 including the sex, because she wanted to force me into saying 12 things that were not true. 13 Q Meaning, you didn't tell Gloria Allred anything about 14 sex; right?

15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained.

17 Q You learned from that, did you not, that a story about 18 President Trump that doesn't include sex will make you no 19 money; right?

20 A It taught me that I should tell the truth and not 21 trust people that I didn't feel like I could trust, and she was 22 one of them. 23 Q In other words, it taught you that if you want to make 24 money off of President Trump, you better talk about sex; right?

25 A No.

2752 1 Although, that does seem to be the case. Exactly.

2 Q So, the next time you tried to sell your story about 3 President Trump, you did, in fact, change your story and say 4 you had sex; right?

5 A I don't know what time you're talking about. 6 Q Well, in 2011, you tried to sell In Touch magazine a 10 Q Well, your conversation with Gloria Allred was in 11 2011; right?

12 A Right. It was in the Fall of 2011. 13 In Touch was in the Spring of 2011. 14 Q When was your baby born?

15 A What was that? 16 Q When was your baby born?

17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Overruled. 19 Just tell us the year.

20 A 2010. 21 Q And when you describe that interaction with Gloria 22 Allred in your book, you said it was right after the baby was 23 born; right? 24 A She was an infant.

25 Q And, in fact, your conversation -- you had a series of 7 story about you having sex with President Trump; right? 8 A The first time I told the story about having sex with 9 Donald Trump was in 2007. So there wasn't a next time.

1 phone conversations with a reporter named Jordi McGraw from 2 In Touch magazine; right? 3 A Right. 4 Q And she taped your conversations; right?

5 A I don't know. 6 Q And, later, a transcript of it was published; right?

13 A Which conversation? 14 Q Well, the conversations you had with this reporter 15 from In Touch magazine; right? 16 A Yes.

17 Q And, you thought an offer -- you were offered $15,000 18 to be paid when the story ran; right? 19 A Correct.

20 Q And, am I correct that then Michael Cohen threatened 21 to sue the magazine if the story would run?

22 A That's what I was told. 23 Q At the same time -- 24 A I don't know.

7 A It was published. 8 I don't know if she records the conversation or not or if 9 she takes notes.

10 Q In 2011, when you were trying -- you had those 11 conversations, you were trying to sell your story, correct, 12 about President Trump; right?

2753 25 Q At the same time you told In Touch magazine that you 2754 1 had sex with President Trump, you had your lawyer, Keith 2 Davidson, tell thedirty.com that you never had sex with Donald 3 Trump; right? 4 A I had him send them a notice to take down what they 5 had written. 6 Q And you denied having had sex with President Trump; 7 right? 8 A Right. Because I was afraid. 9 Q Well, on the one hand, you're telling the story to 10 In Touch magazine that you did have sex; and at the same time, 11 you are telling E magazine -- or thedirty.com that you never 12 had sex with him; right? 13 A It was not the same time. 14 The Dirty came after I was threatened in a parking lot.

15 Q You sure? 16 A (No response).

17 Q You sure about that?

18 A Yeah. 19 They ran it a couple of times I think. I'm not sure.

20 It was not until I was afraid. (Shrugs). 21 Q And, am I correct that you told -- you made a 22 statement in 2011 to E! Online where you said that -- to 23 E! News that the story about you having sex, in your words, was 24 "bullshit"?

25 A I never gave a statement to E!

2755 1 I was asked what I thought about all of this stuff, and I
2 said I thought it was bullshit. 3 Q Well, you said the story was bullshit; right? 4 A Yes. But I did not refer to the act.

5 The fact that there was a story and they were trying to 6 publicize it and put it on all these gossip sites was and still 7 is bullshit. 8 Q So, you're saying now that was not a denial?

10 Q You're saying it was bullshit that it's going to be 11 reported; is that what you're saying?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And that's at the same time you're trying to make 14 $15,000 off of this story?

15 A (No response). 16 Q Is that correct?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And, isn't it a fact that what you said depended on 19 who would pay you money?

20 A No. 21 Q Well, one place you say, "I didn't have sex;" the 22 other place you say, "I did have sex;" and it depends on who's 23 paying money; right? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

25 THE COURT: Overruled.

9 A No.

2756 1 A False.

2 I did 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, and they gave me 3 zero. 4 Q We'll get back to that.

5 I'm back in 2011. Right? You understand that; right? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And Anderson Cooper is in 2018; right? 8 A Yes. 9 Q So, in 2011 -- I'll repeat my question.

10 One place won't pay you money, you say you didn't have sex 11 with President Trump; another place that's offering you 12 $15,000, you gave an extensive interview, saying you did have 13 sex with President Trump? 14 A It was a 15-minute interview, and it was the only one 15 I did, and I turned down all of the other ones for money. 16 Q But, the answer to my question is "yes"; isn't it?

17 A No, it's not.

18 Q And when you say it was a 15-minute interview, it was 19 a 22-page article; wasn't it?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And that's 22 pages of transcript; right?

22 A I don't know. 23 Q And you're a fast speaker, but you think you speak 24 that fast, that you could generate 22 pages of transcript in 25 15 minutes?

2757 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

2 THE COURT: Sustained.

3 A I don't know. 4 Q And, you, in fact, never received that $15,000? 5 A Correct. 6 Q That was because, as you said, President Trump said 7 your story was false and Michael Cohen threatened to sue; 8 right? 9 A I don't know the exact reason why.

10 It did not run. I know that. 11 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa 12 Magniccari relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 13 Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following 14 page.)
2758 1 CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION
2 BY MS. NECHELES: 3 Q. And you claim that in 2011, after you sold your story 4 to In Touch, you were approached by a man in a car? 5 A. By what? 6 Q. A man in a car. 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And according to you, this man threatened you and your 9 infant daughter?

10 A. Correct. 11 Q. He threatened your lives, you said? 13 Q. In 2011, when this supposedly happened, you didn't tell 14 anybody about this supposed threat to yourself and your baby 15 daughter? 16 A. I told my close friends. 17 Q. Well, according to you, that threat happened while you 18 were you on the way to exercise class? 19 A. Correct. 20 Q. And right after it supposedly happened, you say you 21 actually went to that exercise class? 22 A. I didn't go to the class. I went to the restroom in 23 the class. 24 Q. You went to the restroom, after that you went to the 25 class; right?

12 A. He implied it, yes.

2759 1 A. No, I did not return to exercise class. I waited until 2 they were done with the class. 3 Q. But you did not tell anybody at that class -- you 8 Q. You didn't tell anybody else in the class about it? 9 A. No, they left before I came out of the bathroom any 10 way. 11 Q. You never before this instance said you were crying 12 about it, did you, that was the first time you ever said that? 13 A. No, it's not. 14 Q. One minute. 15 Isn't it true that you wrote about this in your book; 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And you said that you went right to the bathroom and 19 you must have looked crazy because the instructor yelled after 20 you, "Are you okay;" right? 21 A. Correct. 22 Q. You said you responded, "She had a blowout, I'll be 23 there in a minute"? 24 A. I was afraid to tell anyone. I was alone in the 25 bathroom. I held my baby close instinctively, covering her head 6 A. No. I lied to her and told her that my baby had a 7 blowout in her diaper, that is why I was crying in the bathroom. 4 didn't tell your instructor that you had just supposedly been 5 threatened?

16 right?

2760 1 as I stared at myself in the mirror.

2 Q. You were shaking still, but less now, correct? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. You didn't say, "I was lying and the instructor saw me 5 crying;" did you?

11 A. Yes. I went to the class afterwards. Everybody was 12 gone. Told my instructor that she had an accident and that was 13 it. 16 A. It was incorrect. I did not do the class. 17 Q. So you wrote a book saying that you did the class and 18 now you are saying you didn't do the class? 21 Q. In any case, you didn't tell anybody in the class about 22 it; right? 23 A. No, but I wasn't close with those women anyway. 24 Q. You didn't call the police, did you? 25 A. No.

14 Q. When you wrote, "I went and did the class," you didn't 15 mean to say, "I did the exercise class?"
6 A. Yes, I did. I said, she had a blowout, that is a lie. 7 That is not telling the truth. 8 Q. Then, in fact, in the same book, you said that, "I went 9 and did the class, told no one what happened in the parking 10 lot;" right?

19 A. I did not do the class. There is no way I could have 20 possibly done exercises as scared as I was.

2761 3 A. Correct.

1 Q. You didn't even tell your husband who was the father of 2 the child who you claim was threatened; right? 4 Q. The first time you publicly told this story that was 5 about a supposed threat to your life was in 2018; right? 6 A. I don't remember. 7 Q. Well, it was on the Anderson Cooper show; wasn't it? 8 A. Publicly in like an interview? 9 Q. Yes. Yes.

10 A. I know I had told it before that because a colleague 11 told it in an interview she did about me. She was the only 12 person that I called that day or the next day after it happened. 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Now you claim you told a colleague? 17 A. Uh-huh. Afterwards, not that day.

18 Q. But you wrote, you told nobody about this story? 19 A. Which I said in the book, as you just read, "I told 20 nobody about it that day or the days that followed." 21 Q. So the first time you mentioned it publicly was seven 22 years after it supposedly happened; right? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. And for seven years it's your claim that you kept this 25 story secret from your husband; right?

13 Q. At the time, though, in your book, you said you told no 14 one; right?

2762 1 A. I kept all of it secret from my husband.

2 Q. Your daughter's life was in jeopardy and you did not 3 tell her father; right? 4 A. Right. 5 Q. But when you went on Anderson Cooper and were 6 interviewed, you decided to announce it to the world; right? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And the reason you told this story in 2018 is, you were 9 using it as an excuse for why you never publicly said before 10 that you had had sex with President Trump; right? 11 A. I don't understand what you are asking. 12 Q. Well, you used this supposed threat that happened to 13 you as an excuse to tell people, this is why I didn't talk 14 publicly, I was afraid; right? 15 A. But I did talk publicly. 16 Q. Well, when did you give a public interview before 17 2011 -- before 2018?

18 A. I talked publicly on the speakerphone on set multiple 19 times. On a radio show in 2007 I told the story. 20 Q. Okay. 21 Ms. Daniels, I am asking about an interview, not what 22 you supposedly told friends. 23 A. An interview on the radio show, that was an interview. 24 Q. When was that? 25 A. In 2007.

2763 1 Q. What show was that?

2 A. A radio show in Tampa. 3 Q. And you didn't say the person's name, did you? 5 Q. Are you sure? 6 A. I wrote it down on a piece of paper and it is shown in 15 Q. And you wrote down three peoples names? 16 A. I don't remember how many names I wrote down, it might 17 have been three or maybe four.

18 Q. It was never made public? 19 A. Correct. 20 Q. What is, you claim, the public story that you claim you 21 told before? 22 A. I mentioned Lake Tahoe and the hotel room, and that is 23 pretty obvious it is about Donald Trump. 24 Q. In 2018, when you went on TV, you said, with Anderson 25 Cooper, "You never told the story publicly before because I was 7 the video. 8 Q. That is what you claim now you said then, but what 9 occurred is --
10 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 11 THE COURT: Overruled. 12 Q. What occurred is, obviously, you were asked four famous 13 people you slept with? 14 A. Yes.

4 A. Yes, I did.

1 threatened?"
2 A. Correct. 3 Q. And you blame that on Michael Cohen; right? 4 A. No, I blamed it on the man in the garage.

5 Q. But you had said that you believed that Michael Cohen 6 was the one who sent that man in the garage?

7 A. I did at the time. I was wrong. 8 Q. At the time, you hated Michael Cohen? 9 A. Absolutely.

10 Q. But, now, you and Michael Cohen are buddies? 11 A. I wouldn't say we are buddies.

12 Q. You went on his podcast a couple of times? 13 A. To have him apologize and he did. 14 Q. You hosted his podcast; right?

15 A. No. 16 Q. You didn't take over his podcast and post it on your 17 site?

18 A. It was not his podcast. My podcast is called "Beyond 19 the Norm." His was called "Mea Culpa."
20 Q. When you say you went on his podcast to have him 22 supposedly having sex with President Trump?

21 apologize, you went on to talk about your story, about 23 A. Correct. 24 Q. And on that podcast he told you he had nothing to do 25 with any supposed threat made to you; right?

2764 2765 1 A. Correct.

2 Q. And, by the way, both you and Michael Cohen share a 3 desire to make money off of seeing President Trump go to jail; 4 right? 8 A. I am sorry, what was the question again?

12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And at that point you had a sketch artist draw a 14 picture of what the man supposedly looked like?

15 A. Michael Avenatti hired a sketch artist. 16 Q. You announced it on The View?

17 A. Yes, he did.

18 Q. You and Michael Avenatti were sitting right next to 19 each other?

20 A. Correct. 21 Q. He was your lawyer; right?

22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And when you say "he did it," you did it with him? 24 A. No, he hired the artist and surprised me with it, 7 Q. You have a desire --
6 THE COURT: Sustained. 5 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, as to Michael Cohen.

11 about this guy that supposedly threatened you; right?

9 Q. With -- withdrawn.

10 In 2018, you went on The View and repeated your story 25 honestly.

2766 1 Q. And you and Michael Avenatti offered a $100,000 reward 2 for anyone who could identify this supposed assailant? 3 A. Michael Cohen offered -- Michael Avenatti offered a 4 $100,000 reward. I would have never agreed to that. 5 Q. Michael Avenatti never had to pay that $100,000 reward, 6 did he? 7 A. No. 8 Q. Because no one ever came forward and said, "I know who 9 this man might be?"
10 A. A lot of people did. Either none of them checked out, 11 or he didn't follow up on it. He definitely got a lot of hits. 12 Q. That's because this man never existed? 13 A. He absolutely existed. 14 Q. The whole story was made up? 15 A. No, none of it was made. 16 MS. NECHELES: Can we take an afternoon break? 17 THE COURT: Would you like to take a break?

18 MS. NECHELES: Yes. 25 (Witness leaving courtroom.) 19 THE COURT: All right. 20 Jurors, let's take an afternoon break. 21 You can all step out. 22 (Jury leaving courtroom.) 24 THE COURT: You may be seated. 23 ***
2767 1 ***
2 (Recess.) 3 *** 4 THE SERGEANT: Continued case on trial. 5 THE COURT: I imagine we are going to continue on 6 Thursday. 7 MS. NECHELES: How late are we going? 8 THE COURT: If we have to continue to Thursday, we 9 will stop at 4:30. Then I imagine there is some redirect.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, your Honor. 11 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

20 CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION 21 BY MS. NECHELES: 22 Q. Before the break just a few minutes ago we talked about 23 an E! Online article; do you recall that? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And you said that you know you were quoted in there as 14 THE COURT: Let's get the jury. 15 (Jury entering courtroom.) 16 *** 17 THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. All jurors 18 are present and properly seated. 19 THE COURT: Ms. Necheles.

12 (Witness entering courtroom.) 13 ***
2768 1 saying that the story is bullshit; right?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. You said what you meant by that, you weren't denying 4 that had you sex with him, you were discussing this is a 5 bullshit thing to do; right? 6 A. Yes. 7 MS. NECHELES: If we can show that. 8 (Displayed.)
11 Trump had played the golfing event and then meeting up multiple 12 times after that? 13 A. No, I do not remember that. 14 MS. NECHELES: If we could show the witness what 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q. Am I correct that you previously said that you 19 vehemently deny the story about the two of you hooking up after 20 Trump had played in a golfing event and vehemently denied 21 meeting up multiple times after that? 22 A. I did not give that statement. I never gave a 23 statement directly to them at all. 24 Q. You're saying that this is not true; that's your 25 testimony?

9 Q. Do you remember saying to E! Online that you vehemently 10 deny the story about you and President Trump hooking up after 15 has been marked as Defendant's J-42. Turn to Page 3 of 16 that.

2769 7 Q. Turning back to -- in 2011, you were denying to 8 thedirty.com that you had sex with President Trump? 9 A. I never spoke to thedirty.com. I couldn't have denied 10 it. They put up a statement. I was asked if I wanted Keith 11 Davidson to have it removed. I absolutely wanted to have it 12 removed. I didn't confirm or deny anything to The Dirty. I 13 never spoke to them. 14 Q. Well, your lawyer did? 15 A. He told them to take the story down. Whether he spoke 16 to them directly or not, I don't know. All I know is, he wanted 17 it down and he took it down.

18 Q. Keith Davidson was your lawyer? 19 A. He was Gina's lawyer. That is how I met him. She 20 said, "Do you want me to have my attorney take it down?" I 21 said, "Yes." 22 Q. You asked him -- you authorized him to deny that story 23 was true and to get it taken down; right? 24 A. No, I did not. I authorized him to have the story 25 taken down.

1 A. I am saying that I did not give a statement denying the 2 story. It says: "Daniels herself told E! News that she is not 3 commenting but the story is bullshit." That is my one comment. 4 Q. So you're saying where the article says you vehemently 5 deny this, the article is false; is that what you are saying? 6 A. Yes.

2770 1 Q. Now, in 2016, you claim you have been threatened and 2 you were afraid for your life; right? 3 A. Yes. 6 your life and your baby's life will be in danger;" right? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And so you decided, well, I'm going to sell my story; 9 right?

10 A. I didn't just decide that, I was given advice from 11 someone to do so. 12 Q. You were given advice, according to you, that instead 13 of staying quiet because your life was threatened, instead, the 14 best thing to do was to go out and sell your story; right? 15 A. Yes. I was very different and a much braver person in 17 guy on television, he was running for President, I was more 18 afraid for my situation. The attorney told me: Get high, stay 19 light, get out in front where you are safe, hide in plain view. 20 Q. In 2011, your story wasn't worth much money? 21 A. I don't know what it was worth. I turned down many 22 offers. 23 Q. You turned down or tried to get $15,000. You couldn't 24 get that? 25 A. Correct.

4 Q. But at that point -- and were you afraid for your life, 5 you had been told, "Don't talk any more about Trump otherwise 16 2016 than I was in 2011. Because Donald Trump was not just a 2771 1 Q. Now, in 2016, you say that you were afraid, but the 2 story was worth a lot of money for you now; right? 3 A. Correct. 4 Q. And you then had Gina Rodriguez go out and try to sell 5 the story; right?

20 A. I am really sorry, I can't always hear when you step 21 away. I am so sorry.

22 Q. When you say this fear that you say you were under in 23 2016 is based on the supposed incident that supposedly took 24 place five years earlier, that you still hadn't told anybody 25 publicly about; right?

9 Q. And you didn't give a free press conference; did you?

10 A. I didn't have to. 11 Q. You were looking to get -- extort money from President 12 Trump; right? 13 A. False. 14 Q. Well, that's what you did; right?

15 A. False. 16 Q. And just when we're talking about your fear, the fear, 17 your supposed fear that you supposedly felt is totally based on 18 the supposed incident that took place in 2011 that you never 19 told anybody about; right?

8 up for free.

6 A. Correct. I didn't care for how much. I just wanted 7 the story out there, which is why I had a press conference set 2772 3 Q. You hadn't told your husband; right? 4 A. No. 5 Q. And then, so, because you had that fear, you decided to 6 do exactly the opposite of what that person had told to you do; 7 right? 8 A. Which person? 9 Q. That supposed guy who showed up in that parking lot?

10 A. Correct. 11 Q. So you weren't really very scared; were you? 12 A. I was terrified. I decided to change my tactic. It 13 was a new ball game. There is a big difference between a 14 reality TV star and someone running for office. 15 Q. The truth is, you saw your opportunity to make it 16 known, you had Gina Rodriguez try to sell your story to the 17 National Enquirer?

18 A. I saw my opportunity to get the story out. I didn't 19 put a price tag on it. That is why I did every interview for 20 free. 21 Q. You didn't do any interviews for free at that point? 22 A. Correct. 23 Q. And I want to show you what is in evidence as People's 24 Exhibit 117A, which are texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan 25 Howard of the National Enquirer.

1 A. It was not a supposed incident. It was a true 2 incident. I had told a lot of people.

2773 1 MS. NECHELES: If we can put that up and turn to 2 Page 2. And if we can blow up the part that starts with 3 "Stormy Daniels." If we can go to the prior line. 4 (Displayed.) 7 2016? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And Gina -- and you see where it says "from G?"
10 A. Yes. 11 Q. There is a redaction? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. Do you see that? I represent to you that is Gina 14 Rodriguez's email address that has been redacted out. 15 Am I correct that she says "Stormy Daniels" in the next 16 box, she says, "I have her?" 17 MS. HOFFINGER: I am going to object as asking 18 this witness what someone else said. 19 THE COURT: It's in evidence. 20 If you can confirm that is what it says, that is 21 what it says. 22 Q. And then Dylan Howard in the next box asks, "Is she 23 ready to talk; right?" 24 A. Yes.

25 Q. And it says, "I thought she denounced it previously,"
5 Q. This is in evidence of texts between Gina Rodriguez and 6 Dylan Howard. Do you see in the first box, it is dated June 28, 1 in the next box; right?

2774 2 A. Yes. I don't know who Wideeye Communications or Dylan 3 is. 4 Q. But, you had, in fact, denounced it previously; right?

5 A. I don't know what this is in reference to exactly, 6 specifically.

7 Q. I am not asking you about it.

11 Q. Had you denounced it previously?

12 A. I don't know what is "previously." 13 Q. Did you denounce the story that you had said that you 14 had not had sex, "Though she denounced it previously?"
15 A. I don't want to confirm or deny something when I don't 16 know what they are talking about.

17 Q. When you look at the next box. She said -- from Gina 18 Rodriguez, she said: "She will do it under two conditions." 19 If you can go to the next box.

20 And then, "She doesn't want to go on record about it, 21 but will tell her story through a source."
22 It says: "She had sex with him. She wants $100,000." 23 Do you see that? 24 A. I do.

25 Q. And that was in June of 2016; correct?

8 MS. HOFFINGER: I am going to ask you to let the 9 witness finish.

10 THE COURT: Sustained.

1 A. Correct.

2775 2 Q. And President Trump was running for President of the 3 United States at that point, correct? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. And you had authorized Gina Rodriguez to try to sell 6 your story; right? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And you wanted to do it through a source; right? 9 A. Once again, I don't know what this is specifically 10 talking about. I don't know who Dylan is. I don't know who 11 Wideeye Communication is. "She doesn't want to go on record 12 about it but will tell the story through a source," I don't know 13 which specific story. Is it about sex? Is it about being 14 threatened? You want me to comment on something when I don't 15 know the context, that's not fair. 16 Q. Putting aside the text. 17 I am asking you a question. My question to you is:
18 In June of 2016, had you authorized Gina David to sell your 19 story under the condition you would tell it through a source? 20 A. I authorized Gina Rodriguez to shop the story so I 21 could make it public. 22 Q. One of your conditions was that you were telling it 23 through a source, and the other was that you get $100,000; 24 right? 25 A. I don't remember that, no.

2776 1 Q. You don't remember those being your conditions?

2 A. No, because they were not my conditions. Before this 3 date, I had a press conference set up for free. 4 Q. Okay. 5 But you didn't do the press conference? 6 A. No, because Gina came back into the picture. I hadn't 7 talked to her in a long time. So, to be quite honest, about the 8 chance to get the story out and make some money, yes. 9 Q. You wanted to get some money?

10 A. Get the story out and make some money. 11 Q. You wanted to do it anonymously; right? 12 A. No. 13 Q. You said Gina Rodriguez's statement there was false? 14 A. I don't know what she is referring to, so I am not 15 going to say her statement is false. 16 MS. NECHELES: And turn to Page 4. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q. Look at the second box from the bottom. And you see it 19 says on the top box: "What happened with Stormy Daniels' 20 interview on Trump?" And then Dylan Howard responds: 21 "Let's discuss this week." And Gina says: "Okay, she's 22 asking." 23 This is in July of 2016; correct? 24 A. Correct. 25 Q. Were you, in fact, pushing again that you wanted to 2777 1 sell your story?

2 A. I was pushing that I wanted to sell my story, yes. 3 Q. And that was in July of 2016; right? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And if you turn to Page 6. 6 THE COURT: Why don't we stop at this point. 7 All right; jurors, let's call it a day. 8 All right. I remind you to, please, not talk 11 Please continue to keep an open minute. 17 with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment 19 concerning the trial. 20 Report directly to me any incident within your 21 knowledge involving an attempt by any person to improperly 22 influence you or members of the jury. 23 Do not visit or view any of the locations 24 discussed in the testimony. 25 And do not use any program or electronic device to 9 either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything 10 related to the case. 12 Do not form or express an opinion about the 13 defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is in 14 and I have given you my final instructions on the law and I 15 have directed you to begin your deliberations. 16 Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss 18 or benefit in return for supplying any information 2778 1 search for or view any locations discussed in the 2 testimony. 3 Do not read, view or listen to any accounts or 4 discussions of the case, that includes the reading or the 5 listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial or 6 the reading of posts on any court sites. 7 Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law 8 related to the case. 9 Do not communicate with anyone about the case or 10 the people involved in the case, and that means including 11 by telephone, text messages, emails, chat rooms, blogs or 12 the internet. 13 Did not search for any information about the case 14 or the law which applies to the case or the people involved 15 in the case. 16 I will see you Thursday morning. 17 (Jury leaving courtroom.)
18 *** 19 THE COURT: You may be seated. 20 Ms. Daniels, you can step out. 21 THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir. 22 (Witness excused.) 23 *** 24 THE COURT: Is there anything we need to discuss 25 at this time?

2779 1 MS. HOFFINGER: No, your Honor. 2 THE COURT: I will see you Thursday.

3 MS. NECHELES: Thank you.
