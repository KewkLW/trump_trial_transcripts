 Senior Court Reporter 2249 1 THE CLERK: This is the People of the State of 2 New York against Donald J. Trump, SMZ 71911/24. 3 Appearances, starting with the People. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 5 Steinglass, Matthew Colangelo, Susan Hoffinger, Becky 20 contempt. 21 In a moment, I am going to hand down my decision 22 on the third motion, in which I find you in criminal 23 contempt for the tenth time.

6 Mangold, Christopher Conroy, and Katherine Ellis.

7 Good morning. 8 MR. BOVE: Good morning. 9 Emil Bove, joined by President Trump seated to my 10 left, and joined by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, and 11 Kendra Wharton.

12 THE COURT: Good morning. 13 Good morning, Mr. Trump. 14 So, the matter called into the record is the 15 People's motion for contempt. 16 Before I hand down my decision, I did want to 17 address the Defense and Mr. Trump. 18 Mr. Trump, as you know, the Prosecution has filed 19 three separate motions asking this Court to find you in 24 It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving 25 as a deterrent; therefore, going forward, this Court will 2250 1 have to consider a jail sanction if recommended.

2 Mr. Trump, it's important to understand that the 3 last thing I want to do is to put you in jail.

23 justice in constant attacks which constitute a direct 24 attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to 25 continue.

4 You are the former President of the United States 5 and possibly the next President, as well. 6 There are many reasons why incarceration is truly 7 a last resort for me. To take that step would be 8 disruptive to these proceedings, which I imagine you want 9 to end as quickly as possible.

10 I also worry about the people who would have to 11 execute that sanction: the court officers, the correction 12 officers, the Secret Service detail, among others. I worry 13 about them and about what would go into executing such a 14 sanction.

15 Of course, I'm also aware of the broader 16 implications of such a sanction. The magnitude of such a 17 decision is not one-sided. 18 But, at the end of the day, I have a job to do, 19 and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the 20 judicial system and compel respect. 21 Your continued violations of this Court's lawful 22 Order threaten to interfere with the administration of 2251 1 So, as much as I do not want to impose a jail 2 sanction, and I have done everything I can to avoid doing 3 so, I want you to understand that I will, if necessary and 4 appropriate.

5 Do the attorneys have any other questions about 6 that?

7 I will now hand down the decision from the Court. 8 This is for the Defense, and this is for the 9 People.

10 (Whereupon, the sergeant gives copies of the 11 Court's decision to the parties.)
12 THE COURT: You can call the trial. 13 THE CLERK: This is People of the State of New 17 witness on Friday.

16 THE COURT: Okay. I believe we finished up a 18 We're going to start with a fresh witness today. 19 Is there anything we need to go over from either 20 side before we get started? 21 MR. STEINGLASS: Just that redactions instruction 22 I ask you to give before we start. 23 THE COURT: You would ask me to do that first 24 thing?

25 MR. STEINGLASS: If you don't mind.

14 York against Donald J. Trump, Indictment 71543/23.

15 Case on trial continued.

2252 1 THE COURT: Not at all.

2 I believe there was no objection from the 3 Defense. 4 MR. BOVE: Not at all.

5 THE COURT: I'll do that first thing. 6 MR. BOVE: There are a number of exhibits we 7 expect the People to offer through the next witness, who 8 we expect to be Jeff McConney. 9 We ask for an opportunity to express our 10 objections outside the presence of the jury. 11 It's very difficult. The People will hand 12 Mr. McConney a thumb drive with a large number of exhibits 13 contained on it. 14 We prefer the Court to look at them one by one 15 beforehand. 16 THE COURT: How many exhibits are we talking 17 about?

20 THE COURT: Why wasn't this brought to my 21 attention sooner? I could have been looking at them over 22 the weekend or this morning. 23 MR. BOVE: I wish, also, we were notified sooner. 24 The Government notified us of this yesterday 25 afternoon, that Mr. McConney would be taking the stand, 18 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, the People intend to 19 admit about 26 exhibits through Mr. McConney.

2253 1 and the exhibits are over 90.

2 I wish we knew that beforehand also, as well. 3 THE COURT: You said you would like to discuss 4 this outside the presence of the jury.

5 Are you asking to excuse the jury? 6 MR. BOVE: I don't think it will take that long.

9 THE COURT: What are the exhibits?

10 MR. COLANGELO: Let me identify them. 11 Just to flag, we identified The Trump 12 Organization exhibits for the Defense and asked them to 13 identify for us any evidentiary objections they had about 14 two weeks ago.

15 On May 1st, they sent us an email identifying a 16 number of exhibits -- a number of objections to certain 17 exhibits. I'll identify them for you now. 18 But, I anticipate we'll only be getting to about 19 eight or so exhibits today, many of -- where there are 20 objections the parties need to discuss. 21 Most of those objections, I understand, are about 22 hearsay questions that I think would not be disruptive to 23 handle at sidebar when it is introduced.

7 My point is, rather than asking for a sidebar to 8 be heard, we prefer to do it in open court.

24 There's at least one exhibit that was the subject 25 of a Defense motion in limine to exclude. That's the 2254 1 exhibit consisting of Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes 2 on the Essential Consultants' bank statement. 3 As your Honor held in the Defendant's motion in 13 witness, McConney, testified in the Grand Jury that notes 20 We do have specific objections to some of these 21 exhibits and --
22 THE COURT: I have no problem with the People 23 handing up the thumb drive, laying a foundation with the 24 thumb drive. Then, as each exhibit is being introduced --
25 not to the jury -- you can make your objection, and we'll 14 were discarded when he found them to be of no further use.

15 The idea that he would be handed a thumb drive 16 and asked a series of general questions with respect to a 17 broad category of types of documents and tick off yes 18 answers to those questions is just not sufficient under 19 these circumstances. 12 With respect to Mr. Weisselberg's notes, this 6 Again, I think to the extent the Defense has any 7 objection after that foundation is laid, we can also 8 handle that at sidebar.

10 MR. BOVE: Judge, I still don't even know what 11 the exhibits are within that range of 90 exhibits.

4 limine, the People are prepared to lay an appropriate 5 business records foundation for that record today.

9 THE COURT: Okay.

2255 1 deal with it.

2 MR. BOVE: It's very hard for me to do that on 3 the fly. 4 I still don't know what the exhibits are.

5 THE COURT: How would it be any easier to do that 6 outside the presence of the jury?

7 MR. BOVE: Because the Government would identify 8 which exhibits they're going to offer through the witness, 9 and I can go through the list we sent them over the 10 weekend of the objections. 11 THE COURT: You sent them a list?

12 MR. BOVE: Yes. 13 THE COURT: So, you know the exhibits being 14 introduced contained within that list.

15 MR. BOVE: Yes. 16 And I would like an opportunity to argue it 17 before your Honor, so you can rule. 18 THE COURT: You can. We'll do it at sidebar. 19 MR. BOVE: If there are 10 or 12 exhibits on this 20 list, it's not tenable for me to do it in real-time with 21 these things.

22 Would it not be more orderly to go through it one 23 by one? 24 THE COURT: I don't want to keep the jury 25 waiting.

2256 1 MR. BOVE: It's not an issue I created. 2 I just found out about the witness yesterday.

3 THE COURT: And when you found out about it 9 But, I don't think there's a reason for the 10 People to preclude the thumb drive.

11 MR. BOVE: I'm not asking for a preclusion 12 remedy.

13 I'm asking for an opportunity to argue my 14 objections. 15 THE COURT: You'll be given an opportunity to 16 argue your objections. 17 MR. BLANCHE: Not for this witness.

18 Before the next witness, we would like to be 19 heard. We have an objection to the witness testifying. 20 THE COURT: It doesn't have to be now?

21 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. 22 THE COURT: I'll hear you then.

23 Let's get the jury, please. 24 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 25 Jury entering.

4 yesterday, it's an issue I could have gone through 5 yesterday and this morning.

6 Now that the jury is here, we'll go through the 7 witness and the exhibits, and you will be given an 8 opportunity to make your objections one by one.

2257 1 (Whereupon, the jurors are present and properly 2 seated.) 3 THE CLERK: Do both sides stipulate that all 4 jurors are present and properly seated?

5 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. 6 THE COURT: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back.

7 I hope you had a good weekend. 8 Jurors, before we call our first witness of the 9 day, I want to give you certain instructions.

10 We have noted certain exhibits have been admitted 11 into evidence, but some material is what we call 12 "redacted". 13 These redactions were made to remove personal 14 identifying information and assure that only relevant 15 admissible evidence is put before you. 16 You may not speculate as to what material has 17 been redacted, and you may not draw any inference, either 18 favorable or unfavorable to either party, with respect to 19 certain information being redacted.

20 You may call your witness. 21 MR. COLANGELO: The People call Jeffrey McConney.

22 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering. 23 (Whereupon, the witness takes the witness stand.) 24 J E F F R E Y M C C O N N E Y, having first been duly 25 sworn and/or affirmed by the court clerk, was examined and 2258 1 testified as follows:

8 Q Are you still preparing tax returns?

19 this morning.

20 What is The Trump Organization? 21 A To me, there's two definitions. As an accountant, 22 there are two legal entities, The Trump Organization Inc. and 23 The Trump Organization LLC. So, that's legal entities. 24 Most people refer to The Trump Organization as President 25 Trump's global holding and ownership of various assets, license 7 A Almost 50. 9 A I'm trying to get my clients to work -- to answer your 10 question, yes. 11 Q Are you here today in response to a subpoena from the 12 District Attorney's Office? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Are you represented by counsel here today?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Who is paying for your attorney?

17 A The Trump Organization.

18 Q You mentioned "The Trump Organization" a few times 2261 1 deals, intellectual property or whatever.

2 Q So, does the name "The Trump Organization" refer, 3 collectively, to all of the different entities that Mr. Trump 4 owns?

5 A That's usually the way I refer to it. 6 Q During the time you worked for The Trump Organization, 7 who ran the company? 8 A President Trump.

10 Trump Organization? 11 A I'm not sure. He was -- he ran the organization. He 12 was the brains behind it. He -- I don't know how to answer that 13 question. 14 Q When you worked there, did you consider Mr. Trump your 15 boss? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Have you had any conversations with Mr. Trump since 18 you retired from the Trump Organization last February? 19 A No.

20 Q You mentioned that The Trump Organization refers, 21 collectively, to a number of different entities.

22 How many entities are part of The Trump Organization? 23 A Before I retired -- I don't know what they've done 24 since -- I believe it was over 500.

25 Q And can you describe the relationship between those 9 Q And before 2017, what was Mr. Trump's role in The 2262 1 entities and The Trump Organization?

2 A That gets a little -- with The Trump Organization, you 3 have to drop the "Org." because that's an entity. All those 4 entities are owned, ultimately, now, by the Donald J. Trump 5 Revocable Trust. 6 Q Okay.

7 I'll ask you about The Trust in a minute. 8 For the entities that make up The Trump Organization, what 9 kind of businesses are they in?

10 A Golf courses, real estate, licensing deals, that's the 11 bulk of the business types. Management company.

12 Q Before you retired, did you have a work email address? 13 A Yes. 14 Q What was the domain name for your email address?

15 A Trumporg.com. 16 Q Where was The Trump Organization headquartered before 17 2017?

18 A 725 Fifth Avenue, in New York City. 19 Q Where was your office located?

20 A 725 Fifth Avenue, New York City. 21 Q Is that also called Trump Tower?

22 A Yes. 23 Q You testified a minute ago that, legally, The Trump 24 Organization itself doesn't hold any assets; is that right?

25 A Yes.

2263 2 assets?

1 Q Is there an entity that holds The Trump Organization's 3 A Well, each entity -- the way we set everything up is 4 each asset was owned by a separate entity and, sometimes, 5 multiple entities. 6 So, Trump Tower would have been owned by an entity, Trump 7 Commercial LLC, and may have had a few members in that entity. 8 And -- does that answer your question? 9 Q Yes.

12 Do they all roll up to The Trust? 13 A Yes. That's the ultimate owner.

16 MR. COLANGELO: Please display for the witness, 17 the Court, and Counsel, a document marked for 18 identification as People's 86. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the 20 aforementioned parties' screens.) 21 Q Let me know if you see that on your screen, 22 Mr. McConney. 23 A Yes. 24 Q Do you recognize this document?

25 A Yes.

10 Do all those entities roll up, ultimately, to -- I think 11 you mentioned "The Trust" a minute ago.

14 Q Who is the official owner, officially, of The Trust?

15 A President Trump.

1 Q What is it?

2264 10 Q Is this one of the schedules' records on the first 11 page?

12 A Yeah. That's the whole schedule, or part of, yes. 13 Q What's the date on the top right of that page? 14 A As of January 20, 2017.

15 Q Did you have an opportunity to review all the of the 16 pages in People's 86 before testifying today?

19 A The pages lay out the ownership structure of which 21 Q Who prepared this document?

22 A I don't know who. 23 I'm under the impression or the understanding that The 24 Trump Organization Legal Department prepared this document.

25 Q And when did you first see it?

2 A It's a summarized structure chart of the Donald Trump 3 Revocable Trust and the ownership layers below it. 4 Q Does the first page of that chart refer to a number of 5 attached schedules? 6 A Yes.

7 MR. COLANGELO: Let's display Page 2, please. 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the 17 A Yes.

18 Q And what do the remaining pages include?

20 entity is owned by or owned another entity.

9 aforementioned parties' screens.)
2265 1 A I believe sometime in early 2017.

2 Q Was this document made in the regular and ordinary 3 course of business? 4 A Yes, it was.

5 Q Was it the regular practice of The Trump Organization 6 to prepare documents depicting the ownership structure of the 7 entities that made up The Trump Organization? 8 A Yes, sir. 9 Q Was this document prepared at or about the time The 10 Trump Organization entities were moved into The Trust? 11 A Yes, sir.

12 Q Was the person or persons who prepared this document 13 under a business duty to do so accurately? 14 A Yes, sir.

15 MR. COLANGELO: I offer People's 86 into 16 evidence.

17 MR. BOVE: No objection.

18 THE COURT: People's 86 is accepted into 19 evidence.

20 (Whereupon, the People's Exhibit is received in 21 evidence.)
22 MR. COLANGELO: Please publish People's 86 in 23 full. 24 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
25 MR. COLANGELO: Let's go back to Page 1.

1 Q Mr. McConney, can you read what it says across the top 2 of this chart, please? 3 A The very top line? 4 Q Yes, please.

5 A "Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust." 6 Q What does it say below that?

7 A Dated "April 7, 2014."
10 A Yes. Some of it, yes. 11 Q Does it show various holding companies that, 12 themselves, hold various entities, which all make up The Trump 13 Organization?

15 Q And do they all roll up to The Trust? 16 A Yes.

17 Q You may have mentioned this a minute ago.

18 The chart refers to a number of attached schedules. Are you 19 familiar with those schedules?

20 A Yes. 21 MR. COLANGELO: Please turn to Page 2.

22 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q What do those schedules show? 24 A Usually, a description of what the entities below it 25 or the relationship or ownership of what those entities have to 2266 8 Q Does this chart depict The Trust ownership structure 9 that you just described?

14 A Yes.

2267 1 another entity.

2 In this case, DJT Management Holdings LLC owns a hundred 3 percent of all the entities below it. 4 Q Do the remaining schedules in this show the 500 or so 5 entities were owned by The Trust as of January of 2017?

7 Q When was The Trust itself created?

19 I'm not a lawyer. So, that's my guess, that it was set up 20 in April of 2014. 21 Q In 2017, who were the Trustees of The Trust?

22 A Donald J. Trump, Junior and Allen Weisselberg. 23 Q You testified a minute ago that your position when you 24 retired from The Trump Organization was Senior Vice President 25 and Controller; is that right?

8 A I'm not too sure. 9 I think the first page said 2014, but I'm really not sure.

10 MR. COLANGELO: Let's go back to the first page. 11 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Let me direct your attention to the top. 13 Is that the date you're referring to? 14 A Yes.

15 Q Do you have an understanding based on that when The 16 Trust was created?

17 A We didn't use it in 2014 or '15, so I don't know if 18 that's when it was set up.

6 A Yes.

2268 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q When did you first become the Controller? 3 A Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years ago? I don't 4 remember the exact year.

5 Q Right before you were promoted to the position of 6 Controller, who held that position at The Trump Organization?

7 A Allen Weisselberg. 8 Q And how did the position of the Controller become 9 open?

10 A Allen was promoted to CFO or Chief Financial Officer, 11 and then I was promoted to Controller.

12 Q As Controller, who did you report to directly? 13 A Allen Weisselberg. 14 Q How long was Mr. Weisselberg your supervisor?

15 A From the day I was hired to the day he left. 16 Q More than three decades?

17 A Yes.

18 Q How often did you interact with Mr. Weisselberg during 19 the time he was the Chief Financial Officer?

20 A Other than having lunch every day, um, whenever I 21 needed to. His office was next to mine. If he needed to find me 22 or if I needed to find him, I'd find him. 23 Q In the time period from 2015 to 2016, who did 24 Mr. Weisselberg report to?

25 A Prior to January 20th of 2017?

2269 1 Q Yes.

2 A Mister -- President Trump. 3 Q Did Mr. Weisselberg meet regularly with Mr. Trump on 4 organizational matters?

5 A I'm sure he met with him. I don't know if it was 6 regularly or not.

7 Q What were your responsibilities as Controller? 8 A I oversaw the 401k plan. I processed payroll. I 9 interfaced with the accounting firm to make sure they had the 10 necessary information to prepare financial statements, tax 11 returns. I worked on loan documents, tried to make sure we 12 adhered to the loan covenants, oversaw the Accounting 16 A Yes.

17 Q Did those responsibilities also include overseeing 18 Accounts Payable? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Did those responsibilities also include overseeing 21 expense payments?

22 A Not really overseeing them. I mean, they really didn't 23 go through me for processing. I know of them, but they were 24 mainly handled by Accounts Payable directly.

25 Q And was Accounts Payable part of the Accounting 13 Department at 725 Fifth Avenue. There may be a few more things. 14 Q Did part of your responsibilities in overseeing the 15 Accounting Department include overseeing the General Ledger?

1 Department?

2270 2 A Yes.

5 Q In your role as Controller, and in the period from 6 2015 to 2017, were there employees that reported to you?

7 A Yes. 8 Q How many? 9 A Around ten.

10 Q Was one of those employees Deb Tarasoff? 11 A Yes.

12 Q What was Ms. Tarasoff's role in the Accounting 13 Department? 14 A She was the Accounts Payable Supervisor.

15 Q Can you tell the jury what "accounts payable" means? 16 A "Accounts payable" means when you or an entity owes 17 somebody money.

18 Q Was Rebecca Manochio part of the staff of the 19 Accounting Department?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Is she one of the people who reported to you?

22 A Yes. 23 Q What was Ms. Manochio's role? 24 A Around that time, she was an Administrative Assistant.

25 She moved up to the Accounts Receivable Department somewhere in 3 Q And you oversaw the Accounting Department as a whole? 4 A Yes.

2271 1 the last few years. I don't remember exactly when.

2 Q What does "accounts receivable" mean? 3 A "Accounts receivable" is the other side, when somebody 4 owes you money. 7 A Yes. 8 Q What is a General Ledger? 9 A General -- there are two books of original entry in 10 accounting. You have cash receipts, the money you receive, and 11 cash disbursements, the money you spend.

12 The General Ledger puts that information together. The 13 information is posted by the General Ledger accounts' receipts, 14 so you can see different types of expenses, payroll, gas, 19 A Yes.

20 Q You mentioned the term "cash receipts". 21 Does that include money coming in?

22 A Yes. 23 Q You also mentioned "cash disbursements". 24 Does that mean money going out?

25 A Yes.

15 electric, how much you're spending at a different point in 16 time.

17 Q Does the General Ledger keep track of all the 18 interactions the General Ledger makes?

5 Q You mentioned that one of your functions as Controller 6 was overseeing the General Ledger; is that right?

2272 1 Q Through your role as Controller, were you familiar 2 with the way The Trump Organization kept and maintained its 3 General Ledgers? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Does each entity that makes up The Trump Organization 6 have its own General Ledger?

13 account. The Member Corp. would be a one percent member or 14 one-tenth percent member. We didn't feel it was a reason for it 15 to have a bank account. Any expenses for that entity could be 16 paid someplace else, so there was no reason to have a bank 17 account or a Ledger.

18 Q For any entity that did have a bank account, it had a 19 General Ledger?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Did The Trump Organization headquarters in Manhattan 22 oversee the accounting for all the entities that make up The 23 Trump Organization? 24 A Not all of them, no.

25 Q Which ones were excluded?

9 There are a number of entities that we have that did not 10 have a bank account, so they did not have a General Ledger. 11 So, for argument sake, if we would set up an LLC, the LLC
12 would pay for the transactions, so it would have a bank 7 A If an entity has a bank account, it has a General 8 Ledger.

2273 1 A Basically, the golf courses and the hotels. They had 2 their own accounting staff. 3 We maintained and took care of all the other entities. 4 Q Okay.

5 So, everything except hotels and golf courses?

7 Q As Controller, was it part of your job responsibility 11 A Yes. 10 Q Is the General Ledger computerized?

12 Q Did The Trump Organization use a particular software 13 program to maintain its General Ledgers? 14 A Yes.

15 Q What was the name of that software program? 16 A We called it MDS. I think it was short for Multi Data 17 Services or Multi Data Systems. I'm not too sure of the correct 18 name. 19 Q But, you called it MDS?

20 A MDS. 21 Q Please explain, briefly, what MDS is.

22 A MDS is a computer program where you can record your 23 cash receipts, money that you received, your bills that you 24 pay, your accounts payable cash disbursements, um, you can run 25 various reports for cash receipts, cash disbursements, General 8 to make sure the General Ledger was accurate? 9 A Yes.

6 A Yes.

1 Ledgers, trial balances, information that the accountants would 2274 2 need to prepare tax returns or financial statements. 3 Q How long did The Trump Organization use MDS as its 4 computerized General Ledger?

5 A That was one of my first jobs back in the '80's, to 6 set up the accounting system. So, we used it from the day it 7 was up and running, sometime in 1990 or '91. It was still in 9 Q Who enters information into the General Ledger system?

10 A Mainly, the Accounting Department. 11 Q Does that include the people we mentioned, 12 Ms. Tarasoff, for example? 13 A Right. 14 Deb would enter bills to be paid.

15 Q Can you use MDS to generate reports? 16 A Yes.

17 Q What kind of reports can MDS generate?

18 A There are standard reports you can run for Accounts 19 Payable if you wanted to see how much -- how many bills you had 20 that weren't paid. If you wanted to see, um, what vendors -- 21 that doesn't make sense.

22 On cash receipts, we can run multi-cash reports, tenant 23 ledgers, rent rolls. 24 There's a variety of reports that you can run.

25 You can also computerize -- I'm sorry -- customize your own 8 use when I left.

2275 1 reports.

2 Q Could you customize a report to show only certain 3 kinds of expenses from one account? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Did you run reports from the General Ledger for tax 6 purposes?

7 A Yes.

14 Q Does the Accounting Department maintain the General 15 Ledger for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust account? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Is that General Ledger managed using MDS?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Does the accounting staff or Accounting Department 20 also maintain bank accounts for The Trust? 21 A Yes.

22 Q What does that entail? 23 A When a bank statement comes in at the end of the 24 month, we reconcile the bank statement. If a deposit comes in

25 cash received, we received money from an entity or person that
10 year, would start giving us a list of entities that they wanted 11 trial balance or General Ledgers for. We would run the entire 12 General Ledger and trial balance and send it to them.

8 Q Describe that, please. 9 A The accounting firm would -- at the beginning of the 13 That's things we did for all '17. Yeah.

2276 9 forward. So, we maintained -- within Multi Data from that point 10 forward, we always maintained bank accounts once we opened 11 them.

12 Q Does the Accounting Department maintain General 13 Ledgers for Mr. Trump's personal accounts?

5 Q How long has the Accounting Department had bank 6 accounts for The Trust?

7 A That program was written sometime, I believe, in the 8 '90's or whenever that program was written, from that point 14 A Yes.

15 Q Does that account have a particular account code? 16 A It has a company code, which is an abbreviation used 17 in order to find information or process information.

18 The code is "DJT". 19 Q When you say "company code" of "DJT", can you describe 20 what that means? 21 A You have your five or six-digit code in the system 22 you're allowed to use. So, if you want to prohibit a cash 23 disbursement or a list of payments, you have to pick a company. 24 Instead of writing "Donald J. Trump", you would just write in 25 "DJT" and "Company". It would access information.

1 owes The Trust money, we record it in cash receipts. If a bill 2 is paid, some charged bill, real estate tax bill, that's paid 3 out of The Trust, that's also recorded in the electronic 4 system.

2277 1 It separated each entity by itself. It was just a short 2 abbreviation for the entity name. 3 Q So, each entity had its own code, and the code for 4 Mr. Trump's account was "DJT"; is that right?

5 A For his personal account, yes. 6 Q Does the accounting staff maintain the General Ledger 7 for the DJT account using MDS? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Did the accounting staff also maintain the books and 10 records for Mr. Trump's bank accounts? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Does that include any checking accounts? 13 A Yes. 14 Q In the 2017 time period, did Mr. Trump use a Capital 15 One checking account as his main operating account? 16 A I believe so, yes.

17 Q Was the Accounting Department also responsible for 18 making sure that all of the entities that are part of The Trump 19 Organization had sufficient cash available for them?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Can you describe that cash management process, please?

22 A We had -- over time -- I had this position years ago. 23 Different people had it over time. 24 Once a week, on a set day, we would run reports on Multi 25 Data to see what our cash balance was.

2278 1 We would receive reports from the outside properties, the 2 golf courses and the hotels, to see what their cash balance 3 was, and they would do a projection for us of how much they 4 needed for the week and how much they expected to receive for 5 the week. Someone would put this together and see if an entity 6 had money to spend or excess money to distribute.

7 For example, if a rental property like Trump Tower had 8 rental receipts that could distribute money to the owner, and 9 if there was another project going on at the golf course, we 10 could then fund that entity. 11 Q How often did the Accounting Department, sort of, 12 prepare that cash acquisition analysis? 13 A This was done on a weekly basis. 14 Q So, if an entity had excess funds to distribute, where 15 would it be distributed to? 16 A It would be distributed to the owner.

17 Q With the owner, here, being the DJT account?

18 A Prior to June 20th, it was the Donald J. Trump 19 personal account.

20 After June 20th, it should have been the Donald J. Trump 21 Revocable Trust.

22 Q When you say "June 20th", do you mean January 20th? 23 A Sorry. 24 January 20, 2017.

25 Q If an entity needed money before January 20, 2017, 2279 1 were funds transferred to that entity from the DJT account?

2 A Yes. 3 Q After January 20, 2017, were those funds transferred 4 to or from The Revocable Trust account?

5 A Yes. 6 Q You mentioned that at one point in time you were 7 responsible for preparing the -- the cash acquisition analysis? 8 A Yes.

12 Q Did you have any particular interactions with him when 13 giving him the report at any point in time? 14 A Yes.

15 Q Can you describe that for the jury, please? 16 A Early on, I think I was employed for about a year, 17 President Trump was on the phone. I walked into his office, 18 dropped a report on his desk, turned around. 19 And he said, "Jeff, hold on a minute" -- sorry. He said to 20 who he was talking to, the person on the phone, "Hold on a 21 minute," and turned around and said, "Jeff, you're fired," and 22 started talking to the person on the phone again. 23 I stood there until he got off the phone call. 24 And he said, "You're not fired, but my cash balances went 25 down from last week." He said, "I know you negotiated this."
11 A I would hand-deliver the report to him once a week.

9 Q Did you have any interactions with Mr. Trump about the 10 cash acquisition analysis?

2280 1 He said, "Now focus on my bills."
7 A Yes. 8 Q Describe that process, generally, please. 9 A An approved invoice is received. Deb would stamp it 10 with her stamp. She would put a code on it. I believe she puts 11 a dollar amount on the voucher, or when she puts it in the 12 system, it creates a voucher. She would put a voucher number on 13 it. So, the voucher is in the Multi Data System. 14 When she was ready to pay it, she would select a voucher, 15 and we would print the check on the checks that we had. She 16 would attach a check to the invoice and give it to the person 17 who's the signatory on the account, the check would be signed, 18 and then she mailed them out. 19 Q You mentioned someone named "Deb".

20 Is that Deb Tarasoff you mentioned before? 21 A Deb Tarasoff.

22 Q As a matter of course, did The Trump Organization ever 23 cut a check if no invoice was submitted? 24 A Of course not.

25 Q Is that true from checks cut from The Trust account?

5 Q Are you familiar with a process by which The Trump 6 Organization accounting staff cuts checks?

2 It was a teaching moment. Just because somebody is asking 3 for money, negotiate with them, talk to them. Just don't do it 4 mindlessly. Think before you do it.

2281 1 A Usually, we tried to get an invoice for any wire 2 transfer check.

5 Is that because she is the Accounts Payable Supervisor? 6 A She is the Accounts Payable Department.

7 Q She is the Department? 8 A As of this point and when I left, she was the only one 9 left in Accounts Payable.

10 Q Must an invoice be approved before a check is cut? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Who has authority to approve invoices? 13 A President Trump when -- before he became President. 14 Allen Weisselberg. Donald Trump, Junior. Eric Trump. When 15 Ivanka Trump was working for us, Ivanka Trump. Allen 16 Weisselberg. Matthew Calamari. Those were the general 17 approvers.

18 Q Did you have authority to approve any invoices? 19 A No.

20 Q In the instances when you were going to 21 Mr. Weisselberg to pay, how did you request approval?

22 A When I had a piece of paper -- I'm an old-timer, I 23 like pieces of paper -- I would bring it to Allen Weisselberg, 24 ask him to approve it.

25 If it came via email, I would forward the email and ask him 3 Q You mentioned that Ms. Tarasoff, generally, handled 4 that process.

2282 1 to approve it.

2 Q If you sent him an email for approval, did he 3 sometimes send approval via email? 4 A Yes.

5 Q Sometime in 2016 and 2017, if a check was approved and 6 checks were cut, who had check signature authority from the DJT
7 account? 8 A The personal account, just President Trump. 9 Q In 2017, who had signature authority on The Trust 15 A There were two different situations. 16 Checks less than $10,000 could be signed by any of the 17 three signatories.

18 Checks over $10,000 had to be signed by two signatories. 19 Q Did the Accounting Department also handle expense 20 reimbursements? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Are you familiar with the process by which Trump 23 Organization employees can be reimbursed for expenses they 24 incurred on behalf of The Trump Organization?

25 A Yes.

11 A The Trust account, I believe, was Eric Trump, Donald 12 Trump, Junior, and Allen Weisselberg. 13 Q For checks that were cut from The Trust account, how 14 many signatures were required per check?

10 accounts?

2283 1 Q Please describe that process.

2 A If they did their expenses, there was an Expense 3 Report they would have to complete, which would entail the 4 employee's name, the entity that the expense was incurred on 5 behalf of, the date of the invoice, the vendor's name, the 6 dollar amount -- um. They would total off the amount. They 7 would sign the Expense Sheet and get their supervisor to 8 approve it. 9 Once it was approved, it was sent to Deb for payment.

11 Q If an employee receives an expense reimbursement from 12 The Trump Organization, is the employee required to report that 13 reimbursement as taxable income on their tax return? 14 A No.

18 A One hundred dollars.

21 attorney?

22 A An outside attorney or a Trump Organization attorney? 23 Q An outside attorney. 24 A An outside attorney, I would assume so; yes.

25 Q Let me hand up a thumb drive containing what has been 15 Q So, if an employee paid out a hundred dollars for a 16 Trump Organization expense, how much would that employee get as 17 a reimbursement?

19 Q Generally speaking, if a lawyer receives payment for 20 legal services rendered, is that taxable income for the 10 Sorry. Deb Tarasoff.

2284 3 (Whereupon, the item is given to the witness.) 4 Q Have you had an opportunity to review the documents 5 contained on that thumb drive?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Do exhibits on this thumb drive include reports for 20 the General Ledger for The Trust accounts? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Do these exhibits include emails, including invoices 23 approved for payment? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Do these exhibits include notes regarding payments?

1 marked for identification as People's 35, 36, 37A to K, 39, 40, 2 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 54, 55, 81, and 93.

6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q How do you know? 8 A My scribble is on the thumb -- my initial and today's 9 date.

10 Q Did you look at that thumb drive earlier day? 11 A Yes. Very early today.

12 Q Did you look at all the files on the thumb drive? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q You signed and dated it after you reviewed it?

15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q Do the exhibits on this thumb drive include reports 17 from the General Ledger for the DJT account?

1 A Yes.

2285 2 Q Do these exhibits include Form 1099's? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Does The Trump Organization keep records relating to 6 A Yes.

7 Q Does that include records for checks cut from the 8 Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust account?

10 Q If I refer to that as "The Trust account" going 11 forward, will you know I mean the Donald J. Trump Revocable 12 Trust account? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Does that include records for the checks cut from the 15 DJT account? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Do those records include invoices?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Do those include entries for the General Ledger?

20 A No. 21 Q Can you explain?

22 A We don't print out the General Ledger, so we have -- 23 I'll try to describe it. 24 When you print a check, the record for that check and the 25 information that you put in is in Multi Data. You can access it 9 A Yes.

5 the checks it cuts?

2286 7 I don't know if I'm off-topic or not.

11 General Ledger?

12 A Yes. 13 Q With respect to the records we just discussed, 14 invoices, entries in the General Ledger, and checks, was it the 15 business practice of The Trump Organization to make and keep 16 those records?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And was it the business practice of The Trump 19 Organization to make and keep notes regarding payments it made?

20 A Yes.

23 A Yes. 24 Q Were those records made at the time of the 25 transactions they reflected or within a reasonable time 1 at any time. You can print it at any time. But, we don't print 2 out that General Ledger for every single check we cut. So, we 3 have a copy of the check or the original check and the invoices 4 behind it. We then scan it and try to attach it to the document 5 in Multi Data. So, we don't really have the General Ledger 6 attached when we sign the check.

8 Q Setting aside whether you maintain the General Ledger 9 entries as part of the checks cut, does The Trump Organization 10 separately maintain records of entries that are made in the 21 Q Were those records made and kept in the regular and 22 ordinary course of business?

2287 1 thereafter?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Was the person who made or kept those records under a 4 business duty to do so accurately?

5 A Yes. 6 Q Does The Trump Organization have an email system that 7 allows you to send and receive messages? 8 A Yes. 9 Q Does that email system record the dates and times that 10 those messages were sent and received in? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Is it part of The Trump Organization's business 13 practice to make and keep records of email messages sent and 14 received?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Are those records kept in the regular and ordinary 17 course of business?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Does the email system keep records of those messages 20 at the same time they're sent? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Are business decisions sometimes made by email? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Have you previously communicated with Michael Cohen 25 using The Trump Organization's email system?

1 A Yes.

2 Q What was your Trump Organization email address in the 4 A I believe it was jmcconney@Trumporg.com.

5 Q In communicating with Mr. Cohen, using your Trump 6 Organization email account, did you ever email him at a Gmail 7 account? 9 Q Did you communicate with Allen Weisselberg using The 10 Trump Organization's email system? 11 A Yes.

12 Q In the 2017 time period, was Mr. Weisselberg's email 13 address weisselberg@Trumporg.com? 14 Q I believe so, yes.

15 Q Did you communicate with Deborah Tarasoff using Trump 16 Organization email?

17 A Yes.

18 Q In the 2017 time period, was her email address 19 dtarasoff@Trumporg.com?

20 A I believe so, yes. 21 Q Were records of those communications stored in The 22 Trump Organization's email system? 23 A Yes. 24 MR. COLANGELO: I offer into evidence the 25 following exhibits: People's 37A to K, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 2288 3 2017 time period? 8 A Yes.

2289 1 48, 49, 54 and 55.

2 MR. BOVE: Your Honor, we object to 37A through 3 K, 45, 54, 55.

21 Q How do you know Mr. Cohen?

22 A Michael was employed by The Trump Organization for a 23 number of years. I've had conversations with him by the 24 coffee -- coffee machine.

25 Q How many years did you work together?

7 THE COURT: So, you're not objecting to 39, 40, 8 43, 44, 48 and 49? 9 MR. BOVE: Correct, Judge.

10 THE COURT: Those are received into evidence. 11 (Whereupon, the aforementioned People's Exhibits 12 are received in evidence.) 13 THE COURT: As far as 37A through K, 45, 54 and 14 55, I find that the People have laid the business records 15 foundation. 16 But, you reserve the right to object individually 17 to these as we come across them.

18 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. 19 Q Are you familiar with someone named Michael Cohen?

20 A Yes.

4 I think there were other documents on that thumb 5 drive that have not yet been offered, and we'll wait for 6 those.

2290 1 A I was there as long as he was. So, I don't remember 2 how long he was there. Five years, ten years. 3 Q When did he leave The Trump Organization? 4 A January 27th -- well, I don't know when he left The 5 Trump Organization. 6 The last day he was paid through was January 27, 2017.

7 Q What was his position in The Trump Organization? 8 A He said he was a lawyer. 9 Q Did he work in the Legal Department?

10 A I guess so. 11 Q Directing your attention to the time period around 12 January 2017, did you become aware that Mr. Cohen needed to be 13 reimbursed for money he was owed? 14 A Yes.

15 Q How did you first become aware? 16 A I had a conversation with Allen Weisselberg.

17 Q When did you have those conversations -- that 18 conversation? 19 A I don't remember specifically. Sometime in 20 January 2017. 21 Q Was anyone else present when you discussed this with 22 Mr. Weisselberg? 23 A I don't think so. I don't remember. 24 Q Please describe the conversation that you had.

25 A Allen said we had to get some money to Michael, 2291 1 reimburse Michael. He tossed a pad towards me, and I started 2 taking notes on what Allen said. 3 That's how I found out about it. 4 Q Okay. 7 A Well, there were two parts of the conversation. 8 One reason I remember the January 27th date is I used to do 9 payroll. Michael's last day was supposed to be January 20th, 10 and we changed it to January 27th. I needed to know that so I 11 would stop paying him at a certain point in time.

12 There was also information -- he had a complaint about his 13 prior year bonus, so he wanted to get paid for that. 14 And then there was some other money he was owed.

15 So, we just added everything up and came up with the amount 16 we would have had to pay him.

17 Q You said in one conversation Mr. Weisselberg described 18 these and asked you to take care of it? 19 A It was one continuous conversation. One conversation.

20 Q And in that conversation, did Mr. Weisselberg also 21 give you a bank statement with notes on it?

22 A I don't think it was at that time. 23 I got it at a later time. 24 Q Okay.

25 Can you please describe the later time when you got the 5 Tell us a little bit more about what Mr. Weisselberg said 6 about the money that had to get paid to Mr. Cohen.

2292 1 bank statement?

2 A Um, Allen gave me the bank statement and said, "Just 3 keep it in the files." 4 MR. COLANGELO: Can we display People's 5 Exhibit 35 from the thumb drive for the witness, the 6 Court, and the parties only.

7 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens 8 of the aforementioned parties.) 9 Q Mr. McConney, I'm now showing you a document that's 10 been marked People's 35. 11 Do you recognize this document?

12 A Yes. 13 Q What is it? 14 A This is the bank statement that Allen gave me to put 15 in the files. 16 Q Is there handwriting on this document?

17 A There are two sets of handwriting on the bottom of the 18 document. 19 Q Do you recognize the handwriting?

20 A I recognize the handwriting on the left side of the 21 page, but not the right side of the page.

22 Q Whose handwriting do you recognize on the left side of 23 the page? 24 A That belongs to Allen Weisselberg.

25 Q How do you recognize his handwriting?

2293 1 A I -- I've read his handwriting for about 35 years.

2 Q Did Mr. Weisselberg sometimes take and keep notes that 3 recorded financial decisions? 4 A Yes.

5 Q A minute ago, you said Mr. Weisselberg gave you a bank 6 statement when you were discussing the payments to Mr. Cohen; 15 Q Is this a true and exact copy of the same piece of 16 paper Mr. Weisselberg gave you in connection with those 17 discussions?

18 A Yes, sir. 19 Q Without describing the details, does Mr. Weisselberg's 20 handwriting set out various calculations that reflect the total 21 amount to be repaid in monthly intervals?

22 A Yes. 23 Q I think you said this a minute ago. 24 Did Mr. Weisselberg direct you to keep this document in the 25 files?

7 is that right? 8 A He gave it to me related to the payments. I don't 9 remember exactly when he gave it to me.

10 I took my notes at a later date. 11 He gave me this bank statement.

12 Q By "this bank statement", you're referring to the one 13 being displayed right now, People's 35? 14 A Yes, sir.

1 A Yes.

2294 2 Q Did you keep it in the files? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Where did you keep it?

5 A I kept it in a payroll book I had in a locked draw in 6 my office. I actually had this document and another document 21 Q This is your handwriting?

22 A That's my handwriting. 23 Q Did you take these notes as Mr. Weisselberg was 24 speaking to you?

25 A Yes.

8 Q In a book in a locked drawer in your office? 9 A Yes.

10 MR. COLANGELO: Can we display People's 36 for 11 identification only to the People, the witness, the Court, 12 and the parties. 13 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens 14 of the aforementioned parties.)
15 Q Do you have People's 36? 16 A It's the one with my chicken scratch on a Trump pad.

17 Yes.

18 Q Are these the notes you just described taking during 19 the conversation that you had with Mr. Weisselberg?

20 A Yes.

7 stapled together in a book.

2295 1 Q Is this a true and accurate copy of what you wrote 2 down? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Did Mr. Weisselberg tell you to write it down?

5 A Yes. He kind of threw the pad at me and said, "Take 6 this down."
10 Q Without giving any details yet, do these notes also 11 set out various calculations that reflect a total amount to be 12 repaid at monthly intervals? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Did you keep this document in the files, as well?

15 A Yes.

18 Q People's 35 and 36 were stapled together? 19 A 35 -- I'll take your word it's 35 and 36; yes.

20 Q Withdrawn. 21 Your notes and Mr. Weisselberg's notes on the bank 22 statement were stapled together, kept in the payroll book in 23 the locked drawer in your office? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Was it the business practice of The Trump Organization 16 This was the document that was stapled to the next 17 statement, the bank statement we just looked at.

7 Q Did you sometimes take and keep notes to record 8 financial decisions? 9 A Yes.

1 to make and keep records of financial obligations to be paid 2 from the DJT account? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And the two documents we just looked at, were they 5 made and kept as part of your regular course of business? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Were these documents made at or about the time of the 8 conversations they record? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Were you and Mr. Weisselberg under a business duty to 11 keep accurate records?

12 A Yes. 13 MR. COLANGELO: I offer People's 35 and People's 14 36 into evidence.

15 MR. BOVE: No objection. 16 THE COURT: People's 35 and 36 are accepted into 17 evidence.

18 (Whereupon, the aforementioned People's Exhibits 19 are received in evidence.)
20 MR. COLANGELO: Let's display People's 35 for 21 everyone, please.

22 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q Mr. McConney, let me direct your attention to the top 24 left-hand corner of the document.

25 What is the title of the document?

2296 2297 1 A "Account Statement."
2 Q What does it say directly underneath that? 3 A "Simplified Business Checking." 4 Q In the top right corner, does it indicate anything 5 about the financial institution? 6 A Yes.

10 A "Essential Consultants LLC. Care of Michael Cohen." 11 Q Directing your attention now about halfway down the 12 page, to the section that reads "Account Summary." 13 Can you read the amount that is listed next to total 14 withdrawals and debits?

15 A $130,035. 16 Q Let me direct your attention lower down the page, to 17 the section that reads "Account Activity."
18 Can you read the transaction just below "withdrawals and 19 debits"?

20 A The first one was the date of "October 27th. Domestic 21 wire funds-debit. Keith M. Davidson Associates PLC."
22 Q What's the amount? 23 A $130,000. 24 Q Now, let me direct your attention to the handwriting 25 on the bottom left of the page.

9 Q What is the name on the bank account? 7 Q What does it say? 8 A "First Republic Bank."
2298 1 Do you recognize that handwriting?

2 A Yes. 3 That's Allen Weisselberg's handwriting. 4 Q Can you please read what Mr. Weisselberg wrote on the 5 bank statement? 6 A Starts at the top. "$180,000." It's underlined.

7 "Grossed up to $360,000. Add additional bonus, $60,000." The 8 two amounts are added together for "$420,000". Then he divides 9 it by -- that's at 12, which equals off to the right, that's 10 "$35,000 per/month effective 2/1/17." 11 Q So, I would like to make sure the jury understands 12 each of the numbers in that equation, starting with the 13 $180,000 figure.

18 Q Can we show the entire bottom part of this document? 19 A So, it's a total of the domestic wire transfer for 20 $130,000, plus the $50,000 paid to Red Finch for tech services. 21 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 24 25 16 A If you pull out and scroll up to the right. It's a 17 combination of two amounts. 14 Where does the $180,000 figure in Mr. Weisselberg's notes 15 come from?

2299 1 (The following proceedings are continued from the 2 previous page.) 3 ******* 4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 5 BY MR. COLANGELO: 6 Q So does the $180,000 amount reflect the total amount 7 owed to Michael Cohen on his request for reimbursement for the 8 $130,000 to Keith Davidson and $50,000 to Red Finch? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Mr. Weisselberg's notes then say "Grossed up to 11 $360,000;" right? 12 A Yes. 13 Q What does "grossed up" mean? 14 A I don't know exactly what it meant, but he probably 15 meant -- so for tax purposes, if Michael recorded $360,000 16 income he would net, assuming a 50 percent tax rate, $180,000. 17 MR. BOVE: Objection. Move to strike the last part 18 of that. 19 THE COURT: Overruled. 20 Q So you are familiar with the concept of grossing up to 21 offset taxes? 22 A Yes. 23 Q You worked as a tax preparer -- you have worked as a 24 tax preparer, I think you said, for five decades? 25 A Yes.

2300 3 A Yes. 4 Q Do you have an understanding of whether some New York 5 City residents are taxed approximately 50 percent on their 6 income? 7 A Between Federal taxes, State taxes -- New York State 8 taxes and New York City taxes, that's about right. 9 Q Do you know where Michael Cohen lived in 2017?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Where did he live? 12 A Do you want the address? 13 Q No. 14 I'm sorry -- 15 A In New York City. 16 Q I'm sorry. 17 Did he live in New York City?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Thank you. 20 Going back to the line in Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten 21 notes that reads: "Grossed up attorney $360,000." 22 I think you said this, but is that double $180,000? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Moving to the next line in Mr. Weisselberg's notes. 25 You testified a minute ago that this reads: "Additional bonus 1 Q Have you prepared individual tax returns for individual 2 City residents?

2301 1 $60,000;" right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Did you discuss this additional bonus with 4 Mr. Weisselberg? 5 A No. On my sheet I wrote down $50,000, which is 6 incorrect, but I just, whatever, that's what Allen told me. I 7 didn't really discuss it with him. 8 Q Did you have an understanding that the payment was to 9 include an additional bonus?

10 A Yes. Michael was complaining that he -- his bonus 11 wasn't large enough for the prior year so this was, I guess, to 12 make up for whatever he thought he was owed. 13 Q And did those amounts then total $420,000? 14 A Yes. 15 Q And you said Mr. Weisselberg's notes then show that 16 total being divided by 12 to equal $35,000 per month; correct? 17 A Yes.

18 Q Did he explain to you what that meant? 19 A That was just math. 20 Q Did you have an understanding as to how the payments 21 were going to be made? 22 A Yes. 23 Q What was that understanding? 24 A At that point in time, we were going to send a wire 25 transfer to Michael for $35,000 per month, starting February 1st 2302 1 of 2017.

2 Q You mentioned a few times that you took notes during a 3 conversation you had with Mr. Weisselberg about these 4 repayments; is that right? 5 A Yes. 6 MR. COLANGELO: Let's display People's 36 in 7 evidence. 9 Q Starting at the top of this document.

10 What is this? 11 A This is the notes I was taking when Allen was talking 12 to me and explaining to me what we owed Michael and how we were 13 going to pay him. 14 Q And what is this piece of paper that you were writing 16 A I'm not sure I understand your question. It was a note 17 pad.

18 Q That answers my question. 19 A Okay. 20 Q And did you -- can you describe to the jury the 21 circumstances when you wrote down these notes? 22 A This was during the first meeting that -- when I found 23 out that we owed Michael money. 24 Me and Allen -- Allen threw a pad on the desk and said "just 25 take notes."
8 (Displayed.)
15 on?

2303 1 And Allen started rattling off stuff, some of which I wrote 2 directly, some of which I did not. 3 Q Can you please read out loud the handwritten text 4 starting at the top? 5 A The top starts with, "Michael Cohen. Pay through 6 January 20th, 2017." 7 That was the original line. 8 The 20th was crossed out and replaced by 27th, which would 9 be the day I took him off, or the last day I would pay him 10 through. 11 Then it says, "bonus 50,000. Then 180,000. 180,000 times 12 two for taxes." 13 The original number I had was just the 50,000 and the 180, 14 and that's where the 230 comes from. 15 The 230 is crossed out. 16 And then I -- when I add the second 180,000, I come up with 17 a total of 410,000.

18 Then he said, "Use 420," because I was possibly rattling 19 the numbers back to Allen and he said: "No, no, the number is 20 420." 21 Instead of figuring out what I did write, I wrote "420." 22 So I used 420 and I divided it by 12 -- by 12 so that's 23 35,000 per month effective 2/1/17, which was 2017. 24 We were to wire the funds monthly from Mr. Trump's -- 25 President Trump's personal account, which was used to wire money 2304 1 from DJT.

2 And underneath that, "Start 35,000 per month January 2017, 3 Mike to invoice us." 4 Q So did these notes refer to the same reimbursement as 5 the handwritten notes on the First Republic Bank statement that 6 we just discussed?

7 A Yes. 8 Q What does "pay through January 20th" -- which you 9 started to say changed to "through January 27th" -- what does 10 that mean? 11 A January 27th, I'm assuming, was the end of a payroll 12 week.

18 A Yes. I'm sorry. As an employee, yes. 19 Q And below that, you said the next line down reads 20 "Bonus $50,000;" right? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And Mr. Weisselberg's notes said the additional bonus 23 was $60,000; is that right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q What accounts for the difference?

13 So that's when I was originally told to take Michael off 14 payroll, that one was changed to January 27th; so that's the 15 last day he was to be paid. 16 Q And that's the last day he was paid as an employee of 17 the Trump Organization?

2305 1 A (Laughter.) I made a Boo-Boo.

2 I just -- I would -- it was a fast conversation. 3 I just scribbled down notes and that's the number that I 4 wrote down. 5 Q But the actual bonus amount was $60,000; is that 6 right? 7 A Right. That's why the correction was -- when I went -- 8 when I had totaled to the $410,000, my bonus number was 9 incorrect.

10 That's when Allen said "Use the 420,000." And I went back 11 to correct the $50,000 to $60,000. 12 Q The next line down in your handwritten notes reads 13 $180,000; right? 14 A Yes. 15 Q Is that the same $180,000 reflected in 16 Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes? 17 A Yes.

18 Q And does that make up the $130,000 made to Keith 19 Davidson and the $50,000 paid to Red Finch? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Let me direct your attention to the next line down, 22 which reads "180,000 times two for taxes;" correct? 23 A Yes. 24 Q What does "times two for taxes" refer to? 25 A That was Allen just talking to me, telling me what he 2306 1 wanted to do; he wanted to double the 180,000 for taxes, so I
2 just wrote the "times two for taxes." 3 Q And you told me before that if a Trump Organization 4 employee submitted an invoice for an expense reimbursement for 5 one hundred dollars, that employee would typically expect to 6 get one hundred dollars back; right? 7 A Yes. 8 Q And in this case, Mr Cohen was receiving $360,000 9 dollars back on a $180,000 expense?

10 A I'm sorry. 11 Ask me that again? 12 Q Does that show that Mr. Cohen was receiving $360,000 13 back on a $180,000 expense? 14 A Yes. 15 Q Were you aware of another expense reimbursement where a 16 payment was doubled for taxes? 17 A No.

20 A Yes. 21 Q And you then wrote, "Use 420," right? 22 A Yes. 23 Q Can you please explain that again? 24 A That's when I told Allen what I came up with; he said, 25 no, "Use 420." 18 Q Your notes then go on to add up the totals and sum them 19 up to $410,000; is that right?

2307 1 Q And do you understand that to be the sum of those 2 figures using the correct amount for the bonus? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Let me direct your attention to the part of your notes 5 where you wrote, "Wire monthly from DJT." 6 A Yes. 7 Q What is the "DJT" a reference to? 8 A That was a reference to President Trump's personal bank 9 account.

10 Q And that was the MDS Code for Mr. Trump's personal 11 account? 12 A Yes. 13 Q Let me direct your attention to the part of the note 14 that reads: "Mike to invoice us." 15 Is "Mike," Michael Cohen? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And what did you understand "Mike to invoice us" to 18 mean? 19 A If Michael wanted to get paid, he had to send us an 20 invoice. 21 Q And is that, based on the processes we discussed, was 22 that typical that someone would have to invoice the Trump 23 Organization for any expense reimbursement? 24 A Yes. 25 Q After the discussions -- the conversations you had with 2308 1 Mr. Weisselberg that we spoke about, did there come a time that 4 A Yes.

19 A It was two dollar signs.

20 Q Please read your message to Mr. Cohen? 21 A "Mike, just a reminder to get me the invoice you spoke 22 to Allen" -- meaning Allen Weisselberg about -- "that you spoke 23 to Allen about." 24 Q What were the invoices that you were referring to in 25 this email message?

7 Q Do you recognize this message?

6 (Displayed.)
8 A Yes. 9 Q What is it?

10 A It's an email from -- to Michael Cohen from me just 11 reminding us to get us invoices or an invoice.

12 Q What is the date on the message that you sent? 13 A February 6th, 2017. 14 Q Was this shortly after your conversation with 15 Mr. Weisselberg in January 2017? 16 A Yes.

17 Q What is the subject line on the email from you to 18 Mr. Cohen?

2 you were in touch directly with Mr. Cohen about processing the 3 payments?

5 MR. COLANGELO: Display People's 39 in evidence.

2309 7 MR. COLANGELO: Can we display just for the 8 witness, the Court, and counsel, People's 37 A. 9 (Displayed for the aforementioned parties.)
10 Q Do you recognize this message? 11 A Yes. 12 Q What do you recognize it to be? 13 A It's an email -- well, it is a series of emails. 14 Starting on the bottom from -- to Allen Weisselberg from myself, 15 and then Allen Weisselberg replies to it. 16 And then I forward an email or send an email to Deborah 17 Tarasoff.

18 Q And this was one of the emails that we talked about 19 that was on the thumb drive that you reviewed; correct? 20 A Yes. 21 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, I offer 37A into 22 evidence. 23 MR. BOVE: Objection. 24 THE COURT: Please approach. 25 (At Side Bar.)
1 A Going back to my handwritten notes, I was expecting 2 invoices. 3 Allen probably called me and said get the invoices from 4 Michael. 5 So I sent Michael an email to send us the invoices or at 6 least an invoice for that month.

2310 1 ******
2 THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Bove? 3 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. 4 This is an email that we would present as an 7 this thread that we object to coming in on the business 8 records foundation. 9 There has to be some other basis for their 10 admissibility. 11 To the extent they're not being offered for their 12 truth, we would ask for a limiting instruction that makes 13 that clear to the jury. 14 And so, I am specifically referring to the Cohen 15 email at 7:59 a.m. And then the email invoice that he sends 18 THE COURT: Can you read it to me? 19 Can you read to me what you believe the embedded 20 hearsay is? 21 MR. BOVE: Yes. The 7:59 a.m. email of -- this is 22 an email from Mr. Cohen to the witness. 23 It says: "Jeff, sorry for the delay. And thank 24 you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks for 25 January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen, 5 example of the embedded hearsay issue. 6 And there are a couple of messages from Cohen on 16 at 11:58 a.m. 17 Those are factual assertions by Mr. Cohen.

2311 1 Esquire."
2 And the address is redacted. 3 And then there is a salutation in that email. And 4 that's one of the factual assertions. 5 THE COURT: And the other one? 6 MR. BOVE: And the second one, if I could just show 7 it to your Honor. 8 (Handed.) 9 MR. BOVE: This is the 11:58 a.m. email, and it's 10 an exhibit which is an invoice that Cohen sends to 11 Mr. McConney. 12 And our objection is that this is not a business 13 record. 14 It's not a Trump Organization business record, at 15 most it's a business record of Mr. Cohen. 16 We assume it's coming in and not being offered for 17 its truth, and we would ask for a limiting instruction that 18 it's being admitted not for its truth. 19 MR. COLANGELO: So, your Honor, as to a second one, 20 this is the evidence of the actual business transaction. 21 And among other things, Mr. Cohen is a 22 coconspirator. 23 We have already laid that foundation. 24 So he -- setting aside that this is past business 25 records that Mr. McConney laid the foundation for, receiving 2312 8 MR. COLANGELO: No, your Honor. I don't think any 9 limited instruction is appropriate.

10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, as to the 7:59 a.m. 12 email, you know, I would make the same argument. 13 There is an initial request for payment. 14 Mr. Cohen, you can tell from email context, was responding 15 to Mr. McConney's request for an invoice. 16 Mr. McConney will testify that he then followed up 17 to say that that wasn't enough for an invoice, but it was 18 part of the process for requesting and accepting/receiving 19 payment. 20 THE COURT: Unlike the situation that came up 21 previously where the People were offering certain emails 22 into evidence as business records -- oh, actually, I think 23 there was an exception. 24 In any event, I find that these are business 25 records.

1 of the invoices by email and incorporating it into The Trump 2 Organization and relying on them for Trump Organization 3 business makes them admissible. 4 So this is admissible both as under the business 5 records exception and the coconspirator exception. 6 THE COURT: And you are not asking for any limiting 7 instruction?

2313 1 They are coconspirator statements.

2 Even though this is an invoice from Mr. Cohen, it's 3 part of the business records that are being kept by the 4 Trump Organization. 5 So your objection is overruled. 6 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. 7 (Side bar concluded.) 8 ******* 9 THE COURT: The objection is noted and overruled.

10 These exhibits are accepted into evidence. 11 (Marked in evidence.) 12 MR. COLANGELO: Please publish Exhibit 37A. 13 (Displayed.) 14 MR. COLANGELO: And let's go to the first exhibit. 15 (Displayed.) 16 ******* 17 BY MR. COLANGELO:
18 Q Mr. McConney, do you recognize this message? 19 A Yes. 20 Q I want to ask you a few questions about it, but first 21 let me ask: 22 Have you ever seen an email message printed out like this 23 before with a series of messages one after the other? 24 A Yes. 25 Q Do you have an understanding that messages may appear 2314 1 in reverse chronological order, with the most recent message on 2 the top or on the first page and the older message following or 3 below the first messages? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Let me direct your attention to the bottom of Page 3, 6 going onto the top of Page 4.

11 Q Can you read that message, please? 12 A "Just a reminder to get me the invoice you spoke to 13 Allen about. Thanks, Jeff." 14 Q Does that appear to be the same message that we just 15 discussed where you e-mailed Mr. Cohen on February 6th? 16 A I believe so, yes. 17 Q Looking just above that message. What does the next 19 A It's an email from Michael: "Jeff, sorry for the delay 20 and thank you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks 21 for January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen, 22 Esquire, and sent to.... hope you are well and see you soon." 23 Q And directing your attention to the next message just 24 above that. 25 Can you read out loud your response to Mr. Cohen?

8 MR. COLANGELO: And if we could have that displayed 9 and zoomed in, if that's possible.

10 Thank you.

7 (Displayed.)
18 message show?

2315 1 A "Mike, please send me invoices so" -- I'm sorry.

2 "Please send me invoices so I can have the checks cut." 3 Q Why did you ask him for invoices? 4 A I need an invoice to get a check cut or wire released. 7 A No. A lot of people ask for money. 9 Q (Laughter.) Okay. Let's take a look at the next 10 message in the chain. 11 And can you read his response, please?

12 A "Jeff, please remind me of the monthly amount?" 13 Q And let's look at the next message. 14 Your response?

15 (Displayed.)
17 Q And when did you send that message?

18 A February 14th at 10:34 a.m. 19 Q And how did Mr. Cohen respond to that message?

20 A He typed an invoice into his response email, which was 21 basically an email from Michael D. Cohen, Esquire, dated 22 February 14th. 23 Do you want me to read the whole thing or? 24 Q Please do.

25 A Dated February 14th, 2017. It says: "Invoice." It's 16 A "$35,000 per month."
5 Q So the email he had sent you in response to your first 6 message, that was not sufficient for you to cut a check?

8 I need an invoice.

2316 1 addressed to "Allen Weisselberg, care of Donald J. Trump, 2 725 Fifth Avenue, New York New York 10022. Dear Allen, pursuant 3 to the retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services 4 rendered for the months of January and February, 2017. 5 January 2017, $35,000. February 2017, $35,000. Thank you. 6 Michael Cohen." 9 A As long as it got approved, yes.

10 Q Did you ever see a Retainer Agreement? 11 A I did not. 12 Q Let's go to the first page of this exhibit. 15 A This is the page after the one we just looked at? 16 Q Correct. 17 A Yes, February 14th.

18 I sent an email to Allen Weisselberg on February 14th at 19 12:02 p.m. 20 "Allen, please approve the below invoice for payment. 21 Thanks, Jeff." 22 Q And let me direct your attention to the next message, 23 right above that one. 24 How did Mr. Weisselberg respond? 25 A Okay. "Okay to pay as per agreement with Don and 7 Q Did you consider this sufficient to serve as an invoice 8 to process these payments?

13 And can you tell us what happened next in this series of 14 communications.

2317 1 Eric."
2 Q Who did you understand "Don" to refer to? 3 A Donald J. Trump, Jr. 4 Q And who did you understand "Eric" to refer to? 5 A Eric Trump. 6 Q I think you testified earlier, were Don and Eric the 7 trustees of the Trust at the time? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And were Don and Eric both approved signers for checks 10 of the Trust at the time? 11 A I believe so, yes. 12 Q What was their role in approving invoices at the time? 13 A They owned the company. They could approve any invoice 15 I'm sorry, they didn't own the company, they were running 16 the company. They were entitled or were allowed to approve any 17 invoice they wanted.

18 Q Did you send this invoice to the Legal Department? 19 A No. 20 Q Was it typical for the Legal Department to review 21 requests for legal payment? 22 A Yes. 23 Q Let me direct your attention to the top message in the 24 chain. 25 (Displayed.)
14 they wanted to.

2318 1 Q Can you tell me what that is?

2 A I forward Allen's -- well, did we go through Allen's 3 approval? Yes. 4 I forwarded Allen's approval on the other email to Deb 5 Tarasoff, accounts payable, and asked: "Please pay from the 6 Trust" -- meaning Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust -- "total 7 expenses for the total amount. Use that account for any 8 payment, otherwise it just won't go anywhere. 9 Put in quotes 'the retainer' for the months of January and 10 February, 2017 in the description." 11 And then there is a description, which is a piece of input 12 data, so that we put that so that it would describe what you are 13 paying. 14 Q When you described earlier your handwritten notes, you 15 wrote down "pay monthly from DJT;" correct? 16 A Yes.

19 A Yes. 20 Q That account is different than the Trust account? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Why in this email did you ask Ms. Tarasoff to pay -- to 23 make this payment from the Trust account instead of from the DJT 24 account? 25 A At that point in time, we were paying the President's 17 Q And that was to indicate that the expenses were to be 18 paid from the DJT personal account; is that right?

2319 1 personal expenses instead of from the DJT personal account from 2 the DJ Trust account, I'm sorry, the DJT Trust account. 3 Q Now, your email asks Ms. Tarasoff to "post the legal 4 expenses;" is that correct? 5 A Yes. 6 Q Please explain what you meant by "post the legal 7 expenses?" 8 A Whenever you make a payment, you have to choose how 9 it's going to be indicated in the General Ledger category, how 10 to put the payment, where to post the payment to, so when you 13 There are a number of accounts you can post it to. 14 We were paying a lawyer so I said to put it -- posted it to 15 legal expenses in the General Ledger. 16 Q What is the General Ledger code for legal expenses?

17 A 51505.
18 Q And in the next sentence, you said "put 'retainer' for 19 the months of January and February 2017 in the description;" 20 right? 21 A Yes. 22 Q What did you mean by that? 23 A I was just taking some information from the invoice, so 24 Deb would know what to put in Multi Data and in MDS, and that 25 part of the information prints on the General Ledger when you 11 print the General Ledger, you know, it summarizes the expenses 12 in that account.

2320 1 print the General Ledger.

2 Q And once that description is in the General Ledger 3 system, who can see it? 4 A Anybody who looks in the General Ledger. 5 Q I'm sorry? 6 A You can look on the screen; you can run a report. I 7 mean, if I run a report, anybody that gets the report can see 8 it. 9 Q And did The Trump Organization's outside accountants 10 also have access to those descriptions? 11 A When we printed the General Ledger for them, yes. 12 They didn't have access to our General Ledger package.

19 Q Did you expect that they would review this expense 20 account at the end of the year for tax purposes? 21 A Yes. This is -- yes, this is one of the accountants 22 that we went over this with, Donald Bender and myself -- Donald 23 Bender is one of the partners of Mazars, who oversaw the account 24 expenses in -- from the Trump accounts. 25 Q Did you know that outside accountants would review this 13 We had to print reports for them and get them reports of 14 documents. 15 Q And why did you print out reports and give them to the 16 accountants? 17 A Usually, most of the time it was for tax purposes, to 18 prepare a tax return or a financial statement.

2321 1 and that those outside accountants would have access to this 2 information? 3 A Yes. 4 Q Is one of the reasons for putting this information in 5 the General Leger for when the outside accountants, who had 6 access to these descriptions, in order to understand the 7 description of legal fees as information that the accountants 8 would need to prepare tax returns or financial statements? 9 A Yes. And part of the conversation -- it would start a 10 conversation if they needed more information. 11 Q After submitting and getting approval on this invoice 12 labeled the request for payment for January and February 2017, 13 did Mr. Cohen submit other invoices? 14 A Yes. 15 Q To your recollection, did he submit one invoice each 16 month after that in 2017? 17 A For the -- for calendar year 2017, yes.

18 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, I offer into evidence 19 People's 37B. 20 MR. BOVE: Same objection, as noted previously. 21 THE COURT: Same objection. Same response from the 22 People? 23 MR. COLANGELO: Yes, your Honor. 24 THE COURT: 37B is accepted into it evidence. 25 (So marked in evidence.)
1 *********
2 MR. COLANGELO: Please display 37B publicly. 3 (Displayed.) 4 Q Mr. McConney, do you have 37B on your screen? 5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q Do you recognize this document? 7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q What is it? 9 A It's a -- from the bottom going up -- it's an email 10 from Michael Cohen to myself and Allen Weisselberg. It was an 11 invoice for the month of March. 12 Q What's the date on this email? 13 A February 16th, 2017. 14 Q I'm sorry, is that the date on the email itself? 15 A Oh, I'm sorry. The date of the email was Thursday, 16 March 16th, 2017 at 11:58 a.m. 17 Q Can you read out loud the message beginning with:
18 "Dear Allen." 19 A "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly 20 remit payment for services rendered for the month of March, 21 2017." 22 Q And what does it say below that? 23 A "March 2017, $35,000." 24 Q And take a look at the top of the page, Page 1 now, 25 please. And tell us what it shows.

22 A Washington, D.C. 23 Q So, when you switched and started paying Mr. Cohen's 24 reimbursement checks from the DJT accounts instead of The Trust 25 account, what did that mean in terms of getting the check 10 pattern, routine.

8 A Basically, whatever I told you last month, post it to 9 legal fees, put the description in, just follow the same 18 Q And you previously told us that Mr. Trump was the only 19 signatory on checks cut from the DJT account; is that right?

14 Q Did there come a time when you switched from using the 15 Trust account to using the DJT account to pay the invoices from 16 Mr. Cohen?

20 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor. 21 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
22 BY MR. COLANGELO: 23 Q Good morning, again, Mr. McConney. 24 A Good morning, sir.

25 Q Just before the break, we were discussing the invoices 2349 1 for payments that totaled $420,000 in 2017.

2 Do you remember that discussion? 3 A Yes, sir. 4 Q Can I display for the witness, the Court and the 5 parties only, People's 45.

9 Q What is this document?

10 A It is one of the reports we can run from the MDS 11 Accounts Payable System.

12 Q Is there any handwriting on this document? 13 A Yes, there is. 14 Q Do you recognize whose handwriting it is?

15 A I do. 16 Q Whose handwriting is it?

17 A Deborah Tarasoff.

22 Q Let's publish that document, please. 23 Mr. McConney, can you describe what this document is? 24 A It's called a query voucher. It's a report that is 25 run for a specific vendor.

8 A Yes, sir.

6 Do you recognize this as one of the documents on the 7 thumb drive you reviewed?

18 MR. COLANGELO: I offer People's 45 in evidence. 19 MR. BOVE: No objection.

20 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 21 (Received in evidence.)
2350 1 In this case, it's run for any entity that pays this 2 specific vendor, any check that was paid during the period 3 January 1st, 2017 to January 5th, 2018. 7 The status, you can run it, if the invoice was paid or 8 unpaid. 9 You can void it, or you can run multiple options, the 10 date of the invoice, the invoice amount, the date paid, check 11 number and a due date, which I think is an automatically 12 generated date. 13 Q You mentioned that this report can show payments made 14 to a particular vendor, is that right?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Who is the vendor in this instance?

17 A Michael D. Cohen, Esquire.

18 Q Who printed this document? 19 A I don't know.

20 Q You said before that you recognized the handwriting on 21 the right-hand side?

24 Q By, she, you are referring to Deborah Tarasoff?

25 A Yes. She is the only person in Accounts Payable, so I
22 A The handwriting, I assume, she wrote it, but I don't 23 know if she did.

4 It includes various information, voucher number, which 5 is a tracking system, the company it was paid from, the 6 vendor's name, a small description of what the invoice was for.

2351 1 figure she ran it. I don't know a hundred percent.

2 Q Can you describe the first column, please? 3 A It says, voucher number. 4 Q And what is a voucher number?

5 A When you are sending, or the software puts an invoice 6 up, or into the Accounts Payable System, it creates a voucher, 7 and an invoice number is automatically assigned by Multi Data, 8 MDS. 9 Q Describe the second column, please?

10 A COMP, which is short for company, that would be the 11 company that paid the invoice.

12 Q And which company does appear in the COMP column on 13 this query voucher summary?

16 Q And does DJT REV and DJT indicate the entity that 17 issued a given payment?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Across the top, does this document show a range for 20 the date paid? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And what is that range? 23 A These are for checks that were cut and issued 24 between -- from and including, January 1st, 2017 through and 25 including January 5th of 2018.

14 A DJT REV, it stands for Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust 15 and DJT is President Trump personally.

2352 1 Q So is this a report that was run on January 5th, 2018 2 to identify all payments to Michael D. Cohen, Esquire in 2017? 3 A That's what it -- I don't know if that's the purpose, 4 but that's what it does reflect.

5 Q What does the handwriting on the top right sum up, if 6 anything?

7 A That's the total of the first three payments which 8 were paid out of the DJT Revocable Trust or the President's 9 Trust.

10 Q What's that total amount? 11 A $105,000.

12 Q Do you see the handwriting below that on the 13 right-hand side?

15 Q What does that handwriting show? 16 A $315,000.

17 Q Do you have an understanding of what that denotes?

18 Do you have an understanding of what that $315,000 19 refers to?

20 A That's the total of the checks that were cut out of 21 the President's personal bank account.

22 Q And is that also the total of the checks that were cut 23 from DJT as an entity? 24 A I am sorry. The DJT account, yes.

25 Q And does the bottom of this report display the total 14 A Yes.

2353 1 amount that was paid in 2017?

2 A Yes. 3 Q What is that total? 4 A $420,000.

5 Q You testified earlier that MDS can run reports for 6 certain expenses in a given account, is that right?

7 A I am sorry. 9 Q Can MDS run reports showing payments that were posted 10 to a particular expense code for a given expense? 11 A Yes. I mean, given an account with an expense code is 12 the same thing in my world, in my language. 13 Q Let me ask that question differently then. 14 Can MDS run a report showing certain expense types 15 that were paid from a given entity? 16 A Yes.

17 Q So could it run a report showing everything booked to 18 the account for Legal Expenses for a given entity and year? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Please display, only for the Court, the witness and 21 parties, People's 54.

22 Mr. McConney, let me know when you have it on your 23 screen? 24 A I have it on the screen.

15 MR. BOVE: Your Honor, as far as I can tell, 16 Government Exhibit 54 relates to a period from 2018 17 forward. If that's correct, we don't see the relevance of 18 those entries in this case. 19 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, People's 54 is an 20 extract from the General Ledger for the Revocable Trust 21 Account that shows all payments made, coded to the Legal 22 Expense Code. 23 The relevance is that there are no payments to 24 Michael Cohen, Esquire from The Trust account for 2018 that 25 were coded to 51505.

20 Mr. McConney, are you familiar with a Federal agency 14 A Yes.

2366 1 Trump Organization, include helping to prepare an Annual 2 Financial Disclosure Report for Mr. Trump to be submitted to 3 the Office of Government Ethics? 4 A Yes. 7 A We called -- we used to call it by the form number. 8 It was 278E, as in Edward. 9 Q Can you describe what the form 278E is?

10 A It -- it is a filing -- it's what's called a Conflict 11 of Interest Form that the Government requires certain 12 individuals to file annually, semi-annually. 13 I am not too sure of other reports, but the President 14 had to file this form annually.

15 Q Did he file it both when he was a candidate for 16 presidency and as President?

17 A He -- we filed reports from -- when he declared his 18 candidacy in 2015 until when he left office in 2017. 19 He is a candidate now. I am not there, so I don't 20 know if he filed anything. 21 Q During your time at the Trump Organization, did you 22 work on the Form 278E before Mr. Trump became President? 23 A Yes. 24 Q What kinds of financial interests are required to be 25 disclosed on the Office of Government Ethics Form 278E?

5 Q Did you have a name for that Annual Financial 6 Disclosure Report?

2367 1 A I am not sure I understand the question.

2 Q You mentioned, Mr. McConney, that the 278E is a 3 Conflicts Disclosure Form? 4 A Conflicts of Interest, yes.

5 Q What kinds of information are collected and reported 6 on that form?

7 A There is a schedule that lists all the entities you 8 belong to, your position in those entities, I believe the date 9 you acquire that position or interest in the company, the date 10 you disposed of it. 11 A listing of your assets, the value of the assets, 12 location of the assets, the income for that assets. 13 I think there were retirement funds, retirement 23 That may be normal for you, but not normal for my 24 life.

25 So we kind of split it up. So I took care of a few 14 payments. Your spouse's assets. Your stock holdings, bond 15 holdings, bank accounts, liabilities. I think gifts. 16 I think that's most of the major, if not all of them.

17 Q What was your role in preparing the report when you 18 worked at the Trump Organization? 19 A The first time I was involved with something, we went 20 through the whole document from A to Z. Since it took so long, 21 at one point we were up at four o'clock in the morning just 22 filing the document.

2368 1 pieces of the form and someone else took care of the rest of 2 the form. 3 Q Which aspects of the form did you take care of later 4 in the process?

5 A I took care of Mrs. Trump's assets, stock holdings, 6 stock transactions, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, 7 liabilities. I think that's it. 8 Q Did you help prepare Mr. Trump, and then President 9 Trump's, submission to the Office of Government Ethics for each 10 year Mr. Trump was a candidate or a Federal official while you 11 still worked there?

12 A Yes. I filed it through, or helped file it, through 13 January of 2017. 14 Q Please display for the witness, the Court and parties, 15 the documents marked for identification as People's 81. 16 And, Mr. McConney, please let me know when you have 18 A It's here. 19 Q Do you recognize this document?

20 A Yes, I do. 21 Q What is it?

22 A This is a 278E. 23 Q Is this the first page of that document? 24 A Yes, it is.

25 Q So this is -- is this a copy of the Annual Financial 17 that on your screen.

2369 1 Disclosure Report of the kind you helped prepare?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Is this the signed -- a Certified Annual Report for 4 year 2017?

6 Q Did you help prepare this document?

8 Q Did you have an opportunity to review each page of 9 People's 81 before testifying?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Is this an exact copy of the signed and Certified 12 Annual Report for President Trump for the year 2017? 13 A I believe so, yes. 14 MR. COLANGELO: I offer People's 81 into 15 evidence. 16 MR. BOVE: Objection.

17 THE COURT: Please approach.

18 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 19 record.)
20 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. 21 My first objection to this exhibit is based on 22 the presidential media argument we made. 23 This is a document that President Trump signed in 24 2018 as President of the United States. And so, we believe 25 it is an official act that should not come into evidence at 7 A Yes.

5 A Yes.

2370 1 the trial.

2 THE COURT: Okay. 3 MR. COLANGELO: So, for the same reasons I 4 believe we briefed and argued previously, there is no 5 evidentiary inadmissibility doctrine for official acts. 6 And, in any event, the regulations require the 7 filing of the OGE Form 278 for presidential candidates, 21 I don't think that can come in as a business 22 record. I don't think as proffered right now, as a 23 business record, it can come in. 24 MR. COLANGELO: We are admitting this to show, or 25 offering this into evidence to show that this is a signed 8 candidates for Federal office and Federal officials, for 9 reasons including for the purpose of ensuring compliance 10 with the Federal Conflict of Interest Law. 11 It is not a document entitled to any evidentiary 12 exclusion at all. 13 THE COURT: I agree. 14 MR. BOVE: The second objection is, that there 15 are parts of this disclosure form that appear to be based 16 on business records that the witness is familiar with.

17 There are other factual assertions in here that I
18 don't know he laid a foundation for, including factual 19 foundations, or governmental official offices adopting the 20 form, on the first page.

2371 1 and certified statement by the Defendant.

2 One page, Page 45 of that document includes a 3 footnote describing his liabilities and acknowledging that 4 in 2016 Mr. Cohen incurred expenses on his behalf, and the 5 Defendant repaid those expenses in 2017.

14 Q Please publish, People's 81.

15 Mr. McConney, please tell the jury what this document 16 is.

17 A This is the President's annual filing of the 18 Non-disclosure Form or Conflict of Interest Form, which I 19 believe is for -- for probably the first 20 days of 2017.

20 Q Mr. McConney, let me direct your attention to the top 21 of the first page to the boxes in the top left corner.

22 Do you see that? 23 A Yes, sir. 24 Q Can you read out loud the report type?

25 A Report type is, Annual.

9 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 10 following occurred in open court.) 11 THE COURT: Overruled.

12 The document is accepted into evidence. 13 BY MR. COLANGELO:
7 THE COURT: Okay. I will let it in. 8 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you.

6 That is an admission.

2372 1 Q And can you read out loud both the year indicator and 2 the year? 3 A The year is -- it says, Year Annual Report Only, 2017. 4 Q Do you understand this to be an Annual Report as 6 A Yes.

7 Q Let's take a look at the middle of the first page and 8 can you blowup that date, please?

10 A May 15, 2018. 11 Q So I think you said a minute ago that this was a 12 report related to the first 20 days of 2017. 13 Having looked at the report type, year and date, do 14 you have a different understanding?

15 A I was going by the upper left-hand corner, which was 16 the date. I misread it.

17 Yes, the years, I misinterpreted the years.

18 Q Well, do you understand this to be the annual report 19 for 2017, which was signed and certified and submitted in 2018?

20 A Yes. 21 Q Thank you.

22 Do you recognize the signature on that first signature 23 line? 24 A Yes.

25 Q Whose signature is it?
5 opposed to a new entry report?

9 What's the date that this was signed and certified?

2373

1 A That's President Trump's signature.

2 Q How do you recognize that signature?
3 A I have seen it many times. 4 Q And tell us, again, what the date is on this document?

5 A May 15, 2018. 6 Q Please take a look at the language just above the 8 Do you see a line that reads, Filer's Certification? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Please read that line out loud? 11 A I certify that the statements I have made in this 12 report are true, complete and correct to the best of my 13 knowledge. 14 Q And that's Mr. Trump's signature in the certification 15 box below that filing certification line? 16 A Yes.

17 Q Let me direct your attention to the 45th page of this 18 document. 19 At the top of the page, can you read what section of 20 the submission we are in? 21 A Part Eight, Liabilities.

22 Q And can you -- now, let me direct your attention to 23 the language at the very bottom of that page. The language in 24 small type.

25 If we can zoom in. Make that as large as we can and 7 signature.

2374 1 highlight there.

2 Mr. McConney, can you read what that line says? 3 A Sure. 4 In the interest of transparency, while not required to 5 be disclosed as reportable liabilities on Part 8, in 2016, 6 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump's attorneys, 7 Michael Cohen.

12 Q Let me ask you a question about the category of value. 13 In your work on the Financial Disclosure Report, this 14 278E Form, do you have an understanding of how liabilities are 15 required to be disclosed? 16 A Yes.

17 Q What is that understanding?

18 A They are reported within a range of a certain point 19 and anything within that range.

20 Q Okay. 21 So a filer is not required to report a specific dollar 22 amount, but instead is required to disclose the dollar value 23 range of a given liability, is that right? 24 A Well, the range that that dollar amount would fall 25 into.

8 Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and 9 Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.

10 The category of value would be $100,001 to $250,000 11 and the interest rate would be zero.

2375 1 Q Tell us, again, what the category of value is for the 2 line you described? 3 A $100,001 to $250,000. 4 Q Earlier today, you testified about your discussions 5 with Allen Weisselberg about money that was owed to Michael 6 Cohen, right?

7 A Yes. 8 Q And you testified that the two payments owed were 9 $130,000 for the wire to Keith Davidson and $50,000 for Red 10 Finch Tech Services? 11 A That's correct.

12 Q And that adds up to $180,000, is that correct? 13 A Yes, sir. 14 Q Is that consistent with the disclosure on the 15 Certified Government Ethics Form of an obligation to Michael 16 Cohen in the range of $100,001 to $250,000 for expenses 17 incurred in 2016?

18 A It was a long question. 19 Can you just repeat it again?

20 I remember pieces of it. 21 Q Sorry. Let me back up a few seconds.

22 You testified about discussions with Allen Weisselberg 23 in January of 2017? 24 A Yes.

25 Q About money that was owed to Michael Cohen?

1 A Yes.

2 Q And the two amounts that were owed were $130,000 to 3 Keith Davidson and $50,000 to Red Finch? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And what does those total up to? 6 A $180,000.

7 Q Is it consistent to the disclosure of a liability in 8 the range of a $100,001 to $250,000? 9 A Yes.

10 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you. 11 No further questions.

12 THE COURT: Your witness. 13 You may inquire. 14 MR. BOVE: Thank you.

15 CROSS-EXAMINATION 16 BY MR. BOVE:
17 Q Good afternoon, Mr. McConney.

18 A Good afternoon, sir. 19 How are you?

20 Q I am well. 21 My name is Emil Bove and I represent President Trump.

22 We haven't met before, right? 23 A No, sir. 24 Q And you just testified about a series of payments that 25 were made to Michael Cohen in 2017, right?

2376 2377 1 A Yes, sir.

2 Q And in that timeframe, 2017, Michael Cohen was a 3 lawyer, right? 4 A Okay.

5 Q Right? 6 A Sure, yes.

7 Q And payments to lawyers by the Trump Organization are 8 legal expenses, right? 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q And you booked those payments on the General Ledger as 11 legal expenses, correct?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And during your 30-something plus years at the Trump 14 Organization, you sort of rarely had conversations with 15 President Trump, right?

17 Q And during the instances when you did speak to him, 18 you didn't talk about accounting software, did you? 19 A No.

20 Q You never gave him a tour of the MD system, right? 21 A No.

22 Q And you have no reason to believe, do you, that 23 President Trump understood the details of MDS? 24 MR. COLANGELO: Objection.

25 THE COURT: Overruled.

16 A Very few.

1 You can answer that.

2378 2 A I am sorry. 3 Can you ask that again? 4 Q You didn't have any reason to believe that President 5 Trump understood the details of MDS? 6 A Correct.

7 Q And you did not talk to President Trump about the 8 events that you just described in response to Mr. Colangelo's 10 A I did not. 11 Q You did not talk to him about those events in 2016, 12 correct? 13 A I did not. 14 Q You did not talk to him about those events in 2017, 15 did you? 16 A I did not.

17 Q And you did not talk to him about those events in 2018 18 either? 19 A I did not.

20 Q Not ever, right? 21 A No.

22 Q President Trump did not ask you to do any of the 23 things that you just described in response to Mr. Colangelo's 24 questions, correct?

25 A He did not.

9 questions, did you?

1 Q And as far as you know, President Trump did not ask 2379 2 anyone to do those things, correct?

3 MR. COLANGELO: Objection. 4 THE COURT: Sustained. 5 Q I am just asking about your knowledge. 6 A Okay. So can you ask it again?

7 Q I can't ask it again. Sorry.

8 I just want to focus, though, my questions to about 9 what you knew.

10 A Okay. 11 Q In none of the conversations that you had with 12 Mr. Weisselberg did he suggest that President Trump had told 13 him to do these things? 14 A Allen never told me that. 15 Q And you testified about some emails that you have 16 exchanged with Michael Cohen, right? 18 Q And it seems like the bulk of those were in 2017, 19 correct? 20 A Yes. 21 Q You did not actually talk to Mr. Michael Cohen about 22 any of these issues, did you?

23 MR. COLANGELO: Objection. 24 THE COURT: Overruled. 25 A No. Talked to Michael, no.

17 A Yes.

2380

1 Q You did not speak to him about these issues, correct?

2 A Correct.
3 Q Not in 2017?

19 A Yes.

20 Q And at that point he started to work as the personal 21 attorney to President Trump, correct?

22 A I believe so, yes. 23 Q Outside of the Trump Organization, right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q Mr. Bernik, if you can please publish Government's Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
6 A Correct.

7 Q Now, Cohen worked at the Trump Organization for a long 8 time, right? 9 A Yeah.

10 Q About a decade? 11 A Give or take. I don't know exactly how long he was 12 there. 13 Q That's a rough ballpark? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And your interactions with him were sporadic? 16 A Minimal.

17 Q And then he left The Trump Organization in January of 18 2017, right?

5 Q Not ever?

4 A Correct.

2381 1 Exhibit 37-A in evidence.

2 Thank you. 3 This is one of the emails that Mr. Colangelo asked you 4 about, right?

5 A Yes. 6 Q This is an email that you sent to Deborah Tarasoff in 8 A Yes. 9 Q Mr. Bernik, if we can please take a look at page three 10 of the exhibit. 11 This is an email thread that contains messages from 12 Michael Cohen, correct? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And in the year, 2017?

15 A Yes. 16 Q February of that year?

17 A February, 14, yes.

18 Q And let's take a look at page five of the exhibit. If 19 you can zoom in on the signature blocks.

20 This is the signature block that Cohen was using in 21 2017, right?

22 A Yes. 23 Q Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q It doesn't say, fixer, does it?

Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
7 February of 2017, right?

1 A No.

2382 2 Q And he is not using a Trump Org. email, correct? 3 A If that bottom line is his email -- it probably should 4 be, based on the signature block.

5 Yes, he did not. 6 Q It is a Gmail account, right?

7 A Yes, sir. 8 Q And these signature blocks are consistent with your 9 understanding of what Mr. Cohen was doing at that time in 2017, 10 right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Which is that Mr. Cohen was acting as President 13 Trump's personal attorney, correct? 14 A Yes.

15 Q So, by early 2017, for accounting purposes, Mr. Cohen 16 was akin to a vendor to President Trump?

17 A Yes.

18 Q Mr. Bernik, can we take a look at Government Exhibit 19 37-C, please, and if you can bring up page three.

20 Can you see that okay? 21 A Yes, sir.

22 Q This is one of the invoices that you -- this is one of 23 the invoices that you testified about, right? 24 A Yes, sir.

25 Q And if you take a look at the header, it says, Michael 2383 1 D. Cohen and Associates PC, right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q That acronym, PC, stands for Professional Corporation, 4 correct?

5 A Yes, sir. 6 Q And you don't know one way or the other whether 7 Michael Cohen actually setup a professional corporation, do 8 you? 9 A No idea.

10 Q But you know that by this time period in 2017 he was 11 purporting to have done so, right?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And in that way, representing that he had an outside 14 firm, correct?

15 A You mean, he was outside The Trump Organization? 16 Q Yes.

17 A Yes, sir.

18 Q And you don't know one way or the other, from your 19 advantage point, whether Mr. Cohen did legal work for President 20 Trump in 2017, do you? 21 A I do not know.

22 Q You don't know if he did legal work for President 23 Trump in connection with Summer Zervos? 24 A Who?

25 Q Summer Zervos?

2384 1 A No idea.

2 Q And you don't know whether Mr. Cohen did legal work in 3 2017 for members of President Trump's family, correct?

21 period of flux and chaos at the Trump Organization?

22 A That's putting it mildly. 23 Q And that's because President Trump had become 24 President of the United States, right?

25 A Yes, sir.

8 So this is an email that -- it's an email thread that 9 you testified about earlier. This message is from Michael 10 Cohen to Allen Weisselberg. 11 Do you see that?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q And do you see where it says, please call me to 14 discuss the last open foundation matter?

15 A Yes, sir. 16 Q And so, does this suggest to you that in 2017 there 17 was an open matter that Michael Cohen was handling?

18 A Yes. 19 Q We can take that down. Thank you.

20 Now, I think you said before that January 2017, was a 5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 Q Mr. Bernik, can you publish Government's Exhibit 37-K,
7 and if we can zoom in on the 9:31 a.m. email. 4 MR. COLANGELO: Objection.

2385 1 Q And the way of doing business at the company had to 2 change, right? 3 A Drastically. 4 Q Change drastically from what had gone on for decades, 6 A Yes, sir.

7 Q And there was a period where things were in flux 8 because you were trying to figure out how to do that, right?

10 Q For the first time in decades President Trump's main 11 office was in Washington, D.C., hundreds of miles away, right?

12 A Yes, sir. 13 Q So, he was not in New York as much as he had been 14 previously to sign personal checks?

15 A I don't remember seeing him in New York at all. 16 Q During the time he was President?

17 A Right, correct.

18 Q And he was the only signatory on his personal checking 19 account, right?

20 A That's correct. 21 Q Now, another change that happened around this 22 timeframe, late 2016, early 2017, is that President Trump's 23 assets were moved into The Trust, correct? 24 A Yes.

25 Q That Trust was accompanied by a set of detailed 9 A Yes, sir.

5 correct?

2386 1 conflict of interest procedures, right?

2 A No idea. I never saw The Trust document, the actual 3 Trust documents. 4 All I have seen was the chart, the structure chart, 5 and there was the entity listing behind it and one paragraph 6 inside The Trust.

7 Q But you understood that the purpose of The Trust was 8 to eliminate potential conflicts of interest as President Trump 9 ran the country, correct?

10 MR. COLANGELO: Objection. 11 THE COURT: Overruled.

12 If you know. 13 A I have no idea. 14 Q Do you recall that Sheri Dillon helped to develop The 15 Trust? 16 A Yes, sir.

17 Q And Ms. Dillon is outside counsel from a law firm, 18 right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q This Trust structure was disclosed to the public in 21 January of 2017?

22 A I have no idea. I don't know that. 23 Q I would like to show the witness, the Court and the 24 parties, if I could, Defense Exhibit H-10.

25 I want you, if you can take a look at that and let me 2387 1 know if it refreshes your recollection about public disclosure 2 relating to The Trust structure. 3 MR. COLANGELO: Objection, your Honor. 4 May we approach?

5 THE COURT: Sure. 6 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 7 record.) 8 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor. 9 First of all, to the extent this is intended to 10 refresh his recollection, he didn't say -- no foundation 11 has been laid.

21 MR. BOVE: If we can have the answer read back.

22 I thought he did. 23 THE COURT: Can you read it back? 24 (Whereupon, the requested testimony was read 25 back by the reporter.)
12 He didn't say that he might know and needs to be 13 refreshed. He said he had no idea. 14 Second, the attempt to offer this document -- for 15 this document to be offered as testimony or argument from 16 counsel on cross, or cross-examination, on anything other 17 than refreshing his recollection, this appears to be an 18 exhibit, or an attempt to admit an exhibit that the Court 19 already excluded for failure to disclose after months of 20 requesting exhibits.

2388 1 THE COURT: I have no idea.

2 MR. BOVE: So, I think when he says -- I can ask, 3 is it possible that something would refresh your 4 recollection, I think that the answer is open enough to 5 allow him to take a look at the document to see if it 6 refreshes his recollection.

7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 9 following occurred in open court.)
10 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan 11 Pearce-Bates was relieved by Senior Court 12 Reporter, Theresa Magniccari.) 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 2389 1 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were 2 continued from previous page:) 3 *** 5 CONTINUED EXAMINATION 6 BY MR. BOVE: 7 Q. I think you testified on direct that there were two 8 Trustees to The Trust? 9 A. Yes, sir.

10 Q. And those Trustees were one of President Trump's son 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. It was basically the Trustees' responsibility to manage 14 The Trust, right? 15 A. Yes, sir. 16 Q. And it was your understanding that The Trust did not 17 file some tax returns, right?

18 A. That's correct. 19 Q. This was not an entity in that sense, right? 20 A. Correct. 21 Q. And I think you said there are over 500 entities that 22 were rolled up into this trust? 23 A. Before I left, there were over 500 entities, to my 24 knowledge. 25 Q. And either directly or indirectly The Trust owns all of 4 THE COURT: Sustained.

11 and Allen Weisselberg, right?

2390 1 them, correct?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And that was true in 2017, right? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And among those entities, there were thousands of 6 employees; correct? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. The entities owned properties all over the world; 10 A. Yes. 11 Q. There were hotels with tens of thousands of guests; 12 right? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Members at golf courses in the thousands; right? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Those facilities hosted weddings and other events; 17 correct?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. Because they were spread out all over the world, they 20 involved settings with all different types of cultures; right? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. President Trump had all different types of partners all 23 over the world; correct? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And as a result of that diversity, there was very real 9 right?

2391 1 commercial risks to adverse publicity; correct?

2 A. I am not a marketing person, it's hard for me to answer 3 that question. 4 Q. But you understood that the organization was paying 5 marketing people; right? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And that if there was news that was negative about 14 Q. And each one of these entities, to the extent they had 15 a bank account, had a General Ledger; is that correct? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. And there was a separate General Leger relating to 18 President Trump's individual account; correct? 19 A. Personal bank accounts, yes. 20 Q. That was in 2017; right? 21 A. From the day it started. 22 Q. And the General Ledger relating to President Trump was 23 to cover his personal expenses; correct? 24 A. It was like his personal checkbook. 25 Q. So, that could include housing costs; right?

8 President Trump or the organization, it was bad for business; 9 correct?

10 MR. COLANGELO: Objection. 11 THE COURT: Overruled. 12 You can answer. 13 A. Yes, sir.

2392 1 A. Housing costs, other personal real estate taxes.

2 Q. Utility bills? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Educational expenses for his children?

5 A. Yes.

9 Q. And you testified a little bit about keeping track of 10 President Trump's cash position? 11 A. Yes, early on.

12 Q. And whether you did, were doing that directly, or 13 responsible for people who were doing it, that continued 14 throughout your time in The Trump Organization?

15 A. I received weekly reports and took a look at it. 16 Q. And there were times during the course of your 17 employment where President Trump's cash position was in the 18 hundreds of millions of dollars; right? 19 A. Yes, sir.

20 Q. And do you recall that in 2017 there were times when 21 that position was at least 60 million dollars in unrestricted 22 cash? 23 A. Well, at least. 24 Q. And those reports that you were looking at, you 25 understood them to be accurate; right?

6 Q. And these were all kept as part of a separate General 7 Ledger; right? 8 A. Yes.

2393 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. These things are true? 3 A. Yes, sir. 4 Q. You were asked a lot of questions about the MDS System 5 and legal expenses; right? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And we talked a lot about the legal expenses account, 8 which is Number 51505; if I have that right? 9 A. That's correct.

10 Q. I only have it right because I can read it. 11 The legal expenses account was a specific item in the 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. It was basically part of a dropdown menu? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. In 2017, it sounds like the MDS System was a bit 17 antiquated; was it not?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. I think you said you actually helped design it; that 20 was in 1991? 21 A. 1991. 22 Q. And, so, these categories, there was a level of 23 rigidity to them; right? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. If you are talking about payments to an attorney, legal 12 charter of accounts?

2394 1 expenses, that was the account that was used; right?

2 A. Yes, sir. 3 Q. As this legal expenses account was used in 2017, the 4 purpose was basically to make payments to attorneys so they 5 could be reviewed at the end of the year; right?

8 Q. You wanted to have one place where you knew you could 13 A. That's correct. 14 Q. You testified on direct examination about two 15 conversations that you had with Allen Weisselberg in 2017; 16 right?

17 A. Relating to this subject, yes.

18 Q. Early 2017? 19 A. Early 2017, yes.

20 Q. And during one of the conversations, you took some 21 notes; if I understand it right?

22 A. Yes. 23 Q. At another point, Weisselberg handed you a document; 24 right?

25 A. Yes.

6 A. Correct. Most legal expenses -- most personal legal 7 expenses are not deductible for tax purposes. 9 find a way to discuss them with Mazars, the outside accountant?

11 Q. So Mazars could make decisions about deductions; 12 correct?

10 A. Yes.

1 Q. I think you said on direct that each of those 2 interactions was short?

2395 3 A. Very short. 4 Q. Under five minutes? 5 A. Probably, yes. 6 Q. Even less, maybe? 7 A. It could have been. It was a few years ago, I don't 8 really remember. 9 Q. During one of those conversations, Mr. Weisselberg 10 conferred to you that Cohen was coming off the payroll of The 11 Trump Corporation; correct? 12 A. That's correct. 13 Q. And that is consistent with the email signature block 14 that we looked at a minute ago? 15 A. Yes, when he became personal attorney for the 16 President, yes. 17 Q. And you said that Mr. Weisselberg mentioned that Cohen 18 was seeking some kind of reimbursement; right? 19 A. Yes. 22 conversations in January of 2017, correct? 23 A. Correct. 24 Q. And I would like to talk a little bit about your notes 25 document, which is Government Exhibit 36. 20 Q. He, Weisselberg, did not say anything to you about what 21 Cohen was seeking reimbursement for when you had these 2396 1 MR. BOVE: If we can bring that up, please.

2 If we can zoom in a bit. 3 Thank you. 4 (Displayed.) 5 Q. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the line 6 that says "X2 for taxes;" do you see that? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. I think you testified previously that you don't have a 9 specific recollection of what Weisselberg told you that meant; 10 right? 11 A. Right. He was just rattling off information I had to 13 Q. You were taking notes and just writing down what he 14 said? 16 Q. And this was his idea, right? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And you don't know where the idea came from, correct? 19 A. No, I don't. 20 Q. Mr. Weisselberg had a lot of different experiences, but 21 he was not a tax accountant; correct? 22 A. He was not a tax accountant. 23 Q. Now, let's take a look at the document that 24 Mr. Weisselberg handed you, Government Exhibit 35, please. 25 MR. BOVE: Zoom in on the bottom, please.

12 write down. 15 A. Yes.

2397 1 (Displayed.)
2 Q. Now, I think you said you don't have a specific 3 recollection of when Mr. Weisselberg handed you this document? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. You don't have a specific recollection of the 6 conversation around the document; right? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And it sounds like, basically, your present memory is 9 that you understood you were supposed to keep track of this 10 piece of paper that he handed you; right? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Now, on direct, you sort of offered an interpretation 13 of the words "gross up;" do you remember that? 14 A. I don't remember the exact wording, but it sounds 15 right. 16 Q. I am referring to the entry on the page, I think you 17 said -- I think you said it reads "gross up two?"
19 Q. But you don't know exactly what Weisselberg meant by 21 A. No, nobody would know. 22 Q. The idea to double the payment to make sure that Cohen 23 got $180,000 after taxes, that doesn't make a lot of sense; does 24 it? 25 A. No. 18 A. Yes. 20 that; do you?

2398 1 Q. And that's because the reimbursement would not have 2 been taxable; right? 3 A. The expense reimbursement is not taxable. 4 Q. And you don't know, do you, how, if at all, Mr. Cohen 6 A. No idea.

7 Q. And with respect to notes on the right side of the 8 document, "Red Finch," you don't know how this got there? 9 A. No, I have no idea who wrote that.

10 Q. You don't know much of anything about Red Finch; do 11 you?

12 A. No, I know very little about Red Finch. 13 Q. You don't know if Cohen paid anything to Red Finch; 14 right?

15 A. That's correct. 16 Q. There is a reference on this document to a bonus; 17 right?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. It says "add additional bonus;" I think you testified 20 $60,000? 21 A. Yes.

22 Q. When Cohen was an employee of The Trump Organization, 23 the bonus would come out through the payroll; right? 24 A. Correct.

25 Q. And in this flux period, that was a lot more 5 treated these payments on his taxes?

2399 1 complicated once he left The Trump Organization; correct?

2 A. What was more complicated? 3 Q. How to pay the bonus, it wasn't as simple as just 4 routing through payroll anymore, he didn't work there anymore? 5 A. Right. 6 MR. BOVE: We can take that down. 7 Q. Now, you testified on direct examination that you kept 8 these two documents, Government Exhibits 35 and 36, your notes 9 and the bank statement in the payroll book; right?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. In a cabinet in your office; right? 12 A. Locked in my office. 13 Q. A cabinet that you locked; right? 14 A. Yes, sir. 15 Q. And the reason that that cabinet was locked was because 16 the payroll book contained a lot of sensitive information; 17 right?

18 A. It was a drawer with other payroll information, not 19 just that book. 20 Q. It's not that these notes were particularly sensitive, 21 it's that the payroll book contained personal identifying 22 information relating to the thousands of employees; right? 23 A. Well, technically, just employees that I was paying 24 through Trump Payroll Corp. It was weekly reports, 25 terminations, a lot of employee payroll information.

2400 1 Q. You locked the drawer to try to keep that sensitive 2 information secure; right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. We're talking about Social Security numbers; right? 5 A. Social Security numbers, dates of birth, salaries, 6 bonuses. 7 Q. And one of the reasons to try and keep salaries and 8 bonuses secure is that you don't want rumors to get around about 9 who is making what; right?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Isn't a fact that most of the drawers in your office 12 were locked? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. For the same reason, right? 15 A. I had a lot of sensitive information. 16 Q. So, you kept it locked to keep it secure; right? 17 A. Yes, sir.

18 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, can we take a look at 19 Government Exhibit 37A, please. 20 And if we can go to Page 2 and zoom in on the 21 11:58 a.m. email. 22 (Displayed.) 23 Q. This is one of the messages that Michael Cohen sent to 24 you in response to the request for an invoice; right? 25 A. Yes, sir.

2401 1 Q. And you see it says "Michael D. Cohen, Esq." at the 2 top; right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. That's consistent with him being an outside personal 5 attorney to President Trump; right? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And you see where it says "Pursuant to the Retainer 8 Agreement?" 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Retainer Agreements can be verbal; correct? 11 A. To my knowledge, yes. 12 Q. And this invoice doesn't say anything about the 13 condition of The Trump Organization; does it? 14 A. The condition of The Trump Organization? 15 Q. The financial condition of The Trump Organization. 16 A. No. 17 Q. And this invoice from President Trump's personal 18 attorney for personal legal expenses does not say anything about 19 the activities of The Trump Organization; right? 20 A. No. 23 (Displayed.) 24 Q. These are two messages, also on February 14th, between 25 you and Weisselberg; right? 21 MR. BOVE: Now, Mr. Bernik, can we zoom in on the 22 email at 12:03 and 12:02 on Page 1.

2402 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And Mr. Weisselberg refers to an Agreement with Don and 3 Eric; do you see that? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. Do you understand that is a reference to two of the 6 President's sons? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. You have no idea what that reference to an Agreement 9 meant; correct?

10 A. Correct. 11 Q. All that you took from that message was that these 12 payments had been approved; right? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Now, if we can look at the top email, please. 15 Thank you.

19 A. Yes. 20 Q. You asked Ms. Tarasoff to pay Mr. Cohen from The Trust; 21 correct? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And that turned out to be a mistake; right? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And you learned that later? 18 Q. With a copy to Allen Weisselberg; correct?

16 So this is a message that you sent to Ms. Tarasoff? 17 A. Yes.

2403 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And part of the issue was that this was all new to the 3 Accounting Department; correct? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. By "this," I mean trying to figure out how to pay 6 President Trump's personal expenses while he was in Washington 7 D.C.; right? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. And so at the time you sent this email, it was not 10 clear to you how you could get President Trump to sign a check; 11 right? 12 A. Correct. 13 Q. And, so, based on conversations with others, your 14 understanding was that it should be paid from The Trust in order 15 to get around that practical issue; right? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. And that was all the thought that went into it; 18 correct? 19 A. That is about it. 20 Q. When somebody told you that President Trump could 21 actually sign checks from his personal account, you fixed the 22 procedure; right? 23 A. I was told he should be paying through his personal 24 account. 25 Q. And at that point all the payments after that were paid 2404 1 out of President Trump's personal checking account; right?

2 A. For this matter, yes.

3 Q. Right.
4 In response to the emails that Michael Cohen sent? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. And you were asked some questions about 1099 forms that 7 The Trump Organization issued to Cohen; right? 8 A. Yes. 9 MR. BOVE: I think that is Government Exhibit 93.

10 If we can bring that up. Can we zoom in here. 12 Q. So, this 1099 was issued by The Trust, correct, the 13 pair? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. And it indicates that $105,000 was paid to M. Cohen; do 16 you see that on the bottom? 17 A. Yes, that was his signature, vendor abbreviation.

18 Q. Vendor abbreviation, relating to the personal attorney 19 services he was providing that were logged on the General 20 Ledger? 21 MR. COLANGELO: Objection. 22 THE COURT: Sustained. 23 Q. What is a "vendor abbreviation?" 24 A. What happens is, Multi Data has various locations where 25 it has abbreviations. We talked about DJT and DJT Revocable, 11 (Displayed.)
2405 1 the company abbreviations. For vendors, you needed a vendor 2 abbreviation. So Michael D. Cohen, Esq. was the name on the 3 check. The vendor name would be M. Cohen. 4 Q. So, once Michael Cohen left The Trump Organization and 5 became the personal attorney to President Trump, he became a 6 vendor for your purposes; right? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And he had a specific vendor identity within the boxes; 9 right?

10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And this is an abbreviation that reflects that vendor 12 identity for Michael Cohen as an outside personal attorney to 13 President Trump; correct? 14 A. Yes. 15 MR. BOVE: If we can go to the second page, 16 please. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q. So this second 1099 reflects payments from President 19 Trump's personal account to Michael Cohen, as personal attorney; 20 correct? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. And you see in box seven, it's listed $315,000 in 23 payments? 24 A. Yes.

25 Q. And so, this is consistent with what you talked about
2406 1 earlier, the first three $35,000 payments were paid out of The 2 Trust, that is the $105,000 on Page 1 of this exhibit; right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And the remaining payments added up to $315,000. This 5 is the 1099 reflecting those payments from President Trump's 6 personal account; right? 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. And you sent this form -- this form was sent to Michael 9 Cohen; right?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. And these payments were also disclosed to the IRS; 12 right? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Because one of the purposes of this form is to make 15 clear to the IRS that payments have been made to a vendor; 16 right? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And there is no place on this form to break down 19 payments for legal services versus expenses incurred by a lawyer 20 during the provision of those services; right? 21 A. That's correct. 22 Q. There is one figure that The Trump Organization 23 reported as being paid to Michael Cohen during the 2017; right? 24 A. That's correct.

25 Q. Then it's Michael Cohen's job, is it not, to make
2407 1 decisions about how to account for these payments on his 2 personal taxes; right? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. You don't know what he did with that? 5 A. That's correct. 6 Q. I would like to talk a little bit about the 278E Form 7 that Government Ethics Form, very briefly. 8 MR. BOVE: Can we take a look at Government 9 Exhibit 81. And if we can zoom in on all the signatures 10 here. 11 (Displayed.) 12 Q. And so you said that the top signature is President 13 Trump's; right? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. And then the signature below that is actually a 16 signature from the Office of Government Ethics; right? 17 A. I believe so, yes.

18 Q. And if you see that there is sort of some fine print 19 between the two signatures? 20 A. I'm not sure where you are looking. 21 Q. Agency, Ethics, Official. 22 A. I was looking down below. 23 MR. BOVE: If we can highlight that, right under 24 President Trump's signature. 25 Q. So that says, "On the basis of information contained in 2408 1 this report, I conclude that the filer is in compliance with 2 applicable laws and regulations;" do you see that? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And the reimbursement to Michael Cohen was disclosed in 5 this form; right? 6 A. Yes. 7 MR. BOVE: If we can take a look at, I think it's 8 Page 45. Bates ending 6360. Zoom in on the very bottom. 9 If we can zoom in on the footnotes, please.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q. You're closer to the screen than I am. Can you read 12 that? 13 A. Yes, sir. 14 Q. This is a disclosure regarding the aspects of these 15 payments that was already reimbursed? 16 A. The bottom two lines. 17 Q. Sent to the Federal Government in 2018; right?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. And signed off by the Office of Government Ethics; 20 right? 21 A. Yes. 22 MR. BOVE: Nothing further. 23 THE COURT: People, any redirect? 24 MR. COLANGELO: Yes, your Honor. Just a few 25 questions.

Did you participate in any conversations with the three 5 of them; Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Weisselberg, about these 6 payments? 7 A. No, sir. 8 Q. Have you come to learn since leaving The Trump 9 Organization that there were matters that Mr. Weisselberg kept 10 you in the dark about? 11 MR. BOVE: Objection. 12 THE COURT: Overruled. 13 MR. BOVE: Hearsay. 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Your answer is yes? 16 A. Sorry; yes. 17 Q. This was all happening above your head?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. You were told to do something, and you did it? 20 A. Yes. 21 MR. COLANGELO: I have no further questions. 22 MR. BOVE: Very briefly. 23 RECROSS EXAMINATION 25 Q. You were asked whether reimbursements are typically 24 BY MR. BOVE:

24 Let's get the jury.

25 MS. BLANCHE: Are you still trying to call 2412 1 Ms. Longstreet-Joseph next?

5 up? 6 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. It doesn't sound like it's for 7 the next witness. 8 The witness that we believe is testifying next, 9 we were just informed a half hour ago, we have -- from what 10 we have just been told a few minutes ago, we have 11 objections to several of the exhibits if this witness is 12 going to go first. 13 Do you want to do that now? 14 THE COURT: We can start. 15 MR. BLANCHE: So, our understanding, for many of 16 the exhibits that the next witness will offer, our 17 objection is exactly the one that we raised earlier today.

20 Trump Organization records. 21 A little bit different with this witness, because 22 for some of them there is a stamp on the invoice, that I 23 believe she will testify that she applied to the invoice. 24 That certainly would be a business record. 25 But the invoice itself, we believe, is 18 Which is, the invoice itself from Mr. Cohen is not a 19 business record, and we object to it being part of The 3 next. 4 THE COURT: There is an issue you wanted to take 2 MR. STEINGLASS: She's not going to be called 2413 1 inadmissible hearsay offered for the truth.

2 I can give you those exhibits now or -- 3 THE COURT: Let me hear from the People.

14 THE COURT: So, the way I understand it from 15 Mr. McConney's testimony, they wouldn't pay out on anything 16 unless they had an invoice. They would receive the invoice 17 and make that invoice part of the package. They would make 18 General Ledger entries. They would cut the check. It 19 would become part of the package. 20 Also, is that part of the res gestae? 21 MR. CONROY: Yes, Judge. 22 MR. BLANCHE: What was the last thing you said? 23 THE COURT: It's part of the crime, the 24 res gestae. 25 MR. BLANCHE: So, your Honor, I don't dispute what 5 invoices that come into The Trump Organization, that then 6 The Trump Organization acts upon and makes payments based 7 upon. I believe all or most of the invoices will be talked 8 about with this witness, she applied a stamp to, and then 9 wrote in certain information.

10 So these are clearly records that The Trump 11 Organization gets and then looks at and makes their own -- 12 takes actions based upon. 13 Each witness will testify to all of them.

4 MR. CONROY: Judge, as counsel mentioned, they're 2414 1 the Court just said. That is what The Trump Organization 2 does. 3 Our objection is a little bit different. While 4 they certainly need an invoice to pay and won't pay without 5 an invoice, the invoice itself that causes them to pay is 6 being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. 7 Meaning, the statements by Mr. Cohen in this case are being 8 offered as a business record exception to the hearsay rule. 9 That's our objection.

10 The more meaningful objection -- it's not the same 11 as the one we raised this morning, from our understanding, 12 the People are going to offer People's Exhibit 42 through 13 this witness, who we believe is a Trump Organization 14 employee. And it appears to us, unless we're wrong to be 15 Capital One Bank Records, and we very much object to that. 16 I can walk through the information on this 17 exhibit -- that is, in theory, going to be offered for the 18 truth. There is no way this witness can offer a business 19 record foundation for this. 20 THE COURT: Who is the witness? 21 MR. CONROY: Judge, the next witness is Deborah 22 Tarasoff, who works in the Accounts Payable Department. 23 She will testify that this Exhibit 42 is a series 24 of cancelled checks, and it's routine for The Trump 25 Organization to get cancelled checks for all of its 2415 3 And so, these cancelled checks, while they were 4 generated by Capital One, were produced by The Trump 5 Organization from their records. 6 THE COURT: Is that what you are referring to? 7 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. 8 Although, our understanding is, they were produced 9 from the bank.

10 Again, we just did this a few minutes ago, even 11 they were going to offer this. 12 If the witness is going to testify that she 13 received these cancelled checks and can explain what the 14 very detailed information is on those personal checks from 15 Capital One, like TRM debit, explain why certain account 16 holders signed the checks and things like that -- again, 17 it's being offered as a business record as opposed to 18 something she just received. We object to that. 19 THE COURT: Can I see it? 20 MR. CONROY: Yes. 21 THE COURT: So, these were checks that were cut by 22 a Trump Organization employee; right? 23 MR. CONROY: Yes. 24 THE COURT: Trump Organization Revocable Trust, 25 they cut it, they made a payment with it in this case. The 1 accounts and keep them as part of the recordkeeping for the 2 organization and for the various accounts that it had.

2416 1 one I am looking at was to Michael Cohen. It goes to the 2 bank processing. It gets cancelled at that point, and they 3 get it back. 4 MR. CONROY: Correct. 5 MR. BLANCHE: I don't know if that is true. If 6 they laid the foundation that way -- but the checks are 7 already coming in separately. This is the document from 8 Capital One. 9 If your Honor looks at the first page of the 10 exhibit, there is all kinds of information stamped on this 11 check. There are kinds of information that is typed, 12 presumably, by Capital One, not by The Trump Organization. 13 If you move on to other checks, there is 14 information on these checks that I don't think this witness 15 can explain. 16 For example, on the second page, it says something 17 totally different on the stamped check. It says something 18 about Richmond, Virginia. It has a signatory that isn't 19 Mr. Cohen. 20 And the point is, the reason why you are supposed 21 to lay a foundation and have the witness testify about the 22 records and what they mean, as we heard this morning from 23 Mr. McConney, there needs to be enough foundation laid to 24 explain and justify the information on the check that is 25 hearsay to allow it into evidence for the truth.

2417 1 There is a lot of information on this check that I
2 don't think this witness can explain. 3 Now, the checks are coming into evidence 4 themselves. Of course, we're not objecting to those. 5 THE COURT: So the checks are coming into 6 evidence. 7 You have a problem with the cancelled checks 8 coming into evidence? 9 MR. BLANCHE: I have a problem with Exhibit 42, 10 which is a bank record, we believe from Capital One, being 11 offered as an exception to the hearsay rule by a Trump 12 Organization witness. 13 THE COURT: I don't have a problem with it. It's 14 a cancelled check. It's the same check that Ms. Tarasoff 15 presumably generated herself and actually paid out. I 16 think that she is certainly capable of testifying that this 17 was standard business practices, that they would receive 18 these cancelled checks every month or every six weeks, 19 whatever. 20 It could come in as business record. It could 21 even possibly come in as real evidence. 25 course. 22 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I do not object. We do 23 not question that she can testify to most of what you just 24 said. Which is, she would receive these in the regular 2418 1 What she can't testify to is the business record 2 part.

15 generated, I received it back from the bank. 16 It demonstrates it was cashed, the check number, 17 the same payee, the same amount.

18 If you want to ask her about these codes and these 19 stamps in the back, you can. I don't think that is 20 necessary to get the document into evidence. 21 MR. BLANCHE: We believe it's a business record of 22 a bank. That's our objection. 23 THE COURT: Okay. Noted. 24 Overruled. 25 Anything else?

8 MR. CONROY: Judge, I don't anticipate eliciting 9 from her what the codes mean. I anticipate eliciting from 10 her what it is, a check that she issued to Michael Cohen, 11 and a reflection of the fact that it was cashed and 12 cancelled by the bank. 13 THE COURT: That's what I am assuming is going to 14 happen. She is going to say: This was the check that I
5 MR. BLANCHE: The hearsay that is being offered 6 for the truth of the matter asserted. The business record 7 exception to the hearsay rule. 3 THE COURT: You are talking about the codes and 4 the stamps and everything else?

I would 16 transactions.

Who could approve invoices? 9 A. Allen Weisselberg, Jeffrey McConney. Obviously, 10 Mr. Trump. Anybody in the Legal Department. 11 Q.

Did the dollar amount of an invoice impact who could 17 approve it?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. We talked a little bit about the General Ledger. Did 12 each of the entities that you handled at The Trump Organization 13 have its own General Ledger? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q.

18 Q. As part of your responsibilities in Accounts Payable, 19 did you handle Accounts Payable for an entity called "DJT?" 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. What was that? 22 A. DJT is Mr. Trump's personal account. 23 Q. And did that account have its own General Ledger? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And that is back in 2015, '16, '17?

2432 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And you processed the accounts payable for that account 3 the same way you did for all the other accounts? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. And did you cut checks from that account? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Do you recall -- withdrawn. 8 Once you cut a check, what would you do with it? 9 A. Which account?

10 Q. Let's say from the DJT account back in 2017, 2016, 11 2017, that time period? 12 A. Before he was President or after? 13 Q. Let's start with before. 14 A. Before, I would cut the check, put it together with the 15 backup, and bring it over to Rhona, so she would bring it in to 16 Mr. Trump to sign. 17 Q. You said "put it together with the backup, "what was 18 the backup? 19 A. The invoice. 20 Q. Was there ever more than an invoice or was it usually 21 just an invoice? 22 A. Basically, it's just an invoice. 23 Q. And how would you put the check together with the 24 invoice? 25 A. Just put the check on top of the invoice, staple it and 2433 1 bring it over.

2 Q. And you said you would bring it over to Rhona? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. At some point, would you get those back? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Were they in the same condition when you got them back? 7 A. They would be signed. 8 Q. And were the invoice and the check still stapled 9 together?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Did you have a general practice, would you staple the 12 check on top of the invoice, or the invoice on top of the check, 13 or did it vary? 14 A. The check is on top of the invoice. 15 Q. And -- withdrawn. 16 Were you responsible for reimbursing expenses to 17 vendors?

18 A. Yes. 19 Q. Did you generally require proof of an expense? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. What kind of expense? 22 A. The backup receipt. 23 Q. And how much would The Trump Organization usually 25 A. Whatever amount it was. 24 reimburse when an employee incurred an expense?

2434 1 Q. So, if an employee incurred an expense of $100, how 2 much would The Trump Organization reimburse? 3 A. One hundred dollars. 4 Q. Now, you talked a little bit about invoices. I want to 5 talk a little bit about who could sign checks, particularly for 6 the DJT account. 7 Who could sign checks for the DJT account in 2016 or 8 2017? 9 A. You are talking about Mr. Trump's personal account?

10 Q. Yes. 11 A. Only Mr. Trump. 12 Q. Was that true back in 2016 and 2017? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. If you know, is that still true today? 15 A. Yes, it is. 16 Q. That was any check, it didn't matter the amount? 17 A. It didn't matter.

18 Q. With respect to approving invoices, was the ultimate 19 approvement of payment the signing of the check? 20 A. Say that again. 21 Q. That's okay. 22 We talked a little bit about approving invoices. Did 23 an approved invoice mean that a check had to be signed? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Could the person signing the check decide not to sign 2435 1 the check?

2 A. Yes. 6 A. If Allen approved it, no, I would put it in and cut it 7 and get it signed. 8 Q. What if you cut a check from the DJT account, did 9 Mr. Trump have to sign the check because Mr. Weisselberg 10 approved it? 11 A. No. If he didn't want to sign it, he didn't sign it. 12 Q. Did you ever see situations where he didn't sign 13 checks? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. What would happen in those situations? 16 A. He would write "Void" on it and send it back. 17 Q. How do you know he would write "Void" on it?

18 A. It was signed in a Sharpie in black. That is what he 20 Q. In the 24 years that you have been there, have you seen 21 Mr. Trump's handwriting? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. And his signature? 24 A. Yes. 25 Q. Are you familiar with his handwriting?

3 Q. And so, if, for example, Allen Weisselberg approved an 4 invoice, did somebody have to sign that check or was there still 5 another level of approval?

19 usually uses.

2436 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And are you familiar with his signature? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. I want to talk a little bit about the period in early 5 2017, after Mr. Trump became President. 7 A. I know it's a checking account. 8 Q. So you know it has a checking account. Do you handle 9 Accounts Payable for that account as well?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. And do you handle Accounts Payable for that account the 12 same way you do for the DJT accounts we just discussed and all 13 the accounts you handle? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Do you recall when you started handling the DJT 16 Revocable Trust Account? 17 A. When they started it.

18 Q. Was that when he became President in 2017? 19 A. I don't recall when it came into effect. 20 Q. Do you recall if there was a specific requirement that 21 two people sign checks over $10,000 for the Revocable Trust? 22 A. There was a time, yes. 23 Q. And going now, we talked a little bit about the DJT 24 account. Once Mr. Trump became President, did he still sign all 25 the checks for that account?

6 Do you know what the DJT Revocable Trust is?

2437 1 A. For which one?

2 Q. For the DJT, his personal account? 3 A. His personal, yes. 4 Q. I want to talk a little bit about -- I want to direct 5 your attention to the period of 2017. You worked with Michael 6 Cohen? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Did he leave The Trump Organization at some point? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Do you recall when he left? 11 A. No. 12 Q. Was it around the time that Mr. Trump became President? 13 A. I don't recall. 14 Q. Do you recall processing payments to Michael Cohen 15 after he left The Trump Organization? 16 A. I do believe so, yes. 17 Q. And were those payments that were paid from the DJT
18 account that we talked about a little while ago? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Do you recall generally how the payments to Michael 21 Cohen, after he left The Trump Organization, were processed in 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. How were they processed? 25 A. The same way that everything else is processed. 22 2017?

5 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor. 6 *****
7 CROSS-EXAMINATION 8 BY MR. BLANCHE: 4 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche.

2488 1 A Yes.

2 Q And you were asked some questions focusing on the 3 2016/2017 time frame. 4 Do you remember those questions? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And I believe you said that, for many years, President 7 Trump was around a lot. He was at Trump Tower a lot. 8 Did it change when he was running for President? 9 A Yes.

10 Q He was around less? 11 A Yes. 12 Q And then, obviously, when he was elected President, 13 there was a time in between the election and the time he went to 14 Washington D.C.; correct? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And he was focused, at that point, on getting ready to 17 be President?

18 A I think so. 19 Q And then, obviously -- and you said this. But then, 20 once in January, he left, and was in Washington, D.C. for four 21 years; correct? 22 A Correct. 23 Q And you testified about the process that worked for 24 many years with Ms. Graff, where you would take a check with an 25 invoice to President Trump, and then you would get it back at 2489 1 some point; correct?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And sometimes the check wasn't signed? 4 A Yes. 5 Q And that happened; but, the checks that we just went 6 through for the past hour and a half, except for the one that 7 was cancelled, none of those were voided out by President Trump; 8 correct? 9 A Correct.

10 Q But, you don't know what President Trump did at the 11 White House or wherever he was when he signed those checks; 12 right? 13 He wasn't in New York for those; correct? 14 A Correct. 15 Q And so, you described the process where they would be 16 Federal Expressed, as far as you know? 17 A Yes.

18 Q Correct? 19 A Yes. 20 Q But, that's really all you know about that process; 21 correct? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And I believe you testified about President Trump 24 himself, you did not interact with him a lot over the years; 25 correct?

2490 1 A Correct.

2 Q And did you and your boss -- it sounded like they 3 varied a little bit, but in 2016 and 2017, it was Mr. McConney? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Mr. Weisselberg? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And so, when we saw the back and forth with the emails 8 a few minutes ago, where Mr. McConney would say, Hey, "Deb, 9 please pay," that was what happened all the time; correct?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And the same thing at times with Mr. Weisselberg? 12 A Yes. 13 Q So, you didn't have authority to cut a check on your 16 Q So -- but, is it fair to say that when you testified, 17 that you believed or you thought that Mr. Weisselberg and 18 President Trump talked a lot, you weren't present for those 19 conversations; right? 20 A Right. 21 Q So, when Mr. Weisselberg, on some of the emails that we 22 saw or Mr. McConney told you to go ahead and pay it, generate a 23 check, you didn't get permission from President Trump himself; 24 correct? 25 A Correct.

14 own; correct? 15 A Correct.

2491 1 Q And you understood that when you were told to do that 2 by Mr. Weisselberg or by Mr. McConney, it was approved and you 3 did it; correct? 4 A Yes. 5 Q Now, there were a fair number of questions about the 6 cancelled check, so putting that one aside for a moment, the 7 rest of the checks that you generated, at the time or even now, 8 you have no reason to believe there was anything wrong with 9 doing that; correct?

10 A That's right. 11 Q You knew Mr. Cohen when he worked for The Trump 12 Organization; correct? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And you saw emails after he left, saying that he was 15 the personal attorney to President Trump? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And during the time working for President Trump, which 18 sounds like it was a long time, and there were a couple of years 19 when he was President when you weren't working for him directly; 20 correct? 21 A Correct. 24 like that; correct? 22 Q But, the time prior to that, you never had any reason 23 to believe that President Trump was hiding anything or anything 25 A Correct.

2492 1 MR. BLANCHE: If I may just have one more moment.

2 (Defense counsel confer.) 3 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, Ms. Tarasoff. 4 I have no further questions.

23 I mean, we didn't even know she was a witness 2493 1 was a witness, and we were given a certain number of 2 exhibits that she was going to be offering. 3 We, obviously, spent time preparing not only 4 objections, but we were also preparing for cross. 5 She testified on Friday morning. We crossed her. 6 She admitted exhibits. And then at the next sidebar, they 7 said: We're going to recall her. 8 The rules don't allow for that. 9 I mean, it's discretionary to recall a witness, of 10 course, but it can't just be that we can put a witness on, 11 have us cross her, prepare a witness -- 12 THE COURT: We can excuse the jury for the day, and 13 we can talk about this. 14 I will excuse the jury for the day, and we can talk 15 about it. 16 MR.

10 You may be seated. 11 So, People, you would like to recall a witness? 12 MR. STEINGLASS: That's right, Judge. 13 THE COURT: And what would you like that witness to 14 testify to? 15 MR. STEINGLASS: Among other things, some 16 additional Tweets and Truths from the defendant, as well as 17 to -- as a summary witness to go through some of the texts 18 that were admitted as part of People's 171A. 19 As you know, there was a lot of back and forth 20 about that exhibit, about certain items that were redacted. 21 We tabled it and agreed to have a summary witness read it 22 later. 23 I would like to address counsel's arguments from 24 the bench, but also to address some additional arguments 25 that counsel has made -- and I don't think through any bad 2496 1 faith -- but it's just not true.

2 And counsel has said this several times, that 3 counsel has not had notice of the exhibits that we are going 4 to use. 5 First of all, we have been designating exhibits for 6 the last eight months periodically on a rolling basis, and 7 with very few exceptions, had designated all of our exhibits 8 by March 15th. 9 The Court had a request from the People to extend, 10 and you extended that deadline over the defendant's 11 objection to March 25th, and we served a few additional 12 exhibits. 13 But it's not like this is the first time that these 14 exhibits have been brought to counsels' attention. 15 Second of all, before the trial started, we 16 provided redacted versions of all of the exhibits we 17 intended to introduce at trial, as well as an exhibit list.

18 On April 11th, we had a lengthy conversation with 19 counsel in which we listed precisely which Trump 20 Organization-produced exhibits we would be seeking to 21 introduce. 22 And we did that because we were discussing the 23 potential -- a potential stipulation that didn't end up 24 happening. 25 But, these exhibits have been designated for a very 2497 1 long time, so I don't think counsel is intentionally 2 misleading the Court to say that, you know, they just 3 found out yesterday that these exhibits were going to be 4 admitted.

13 The defense has our witness list; has had it for 14 months.

20 telling them the day before who our witnesses are or what 21 our exhibits are. 22 They may not be finding out the order of which 23 we're going to be calling these witnesses or introducing 24 these exhibits. 25 But, they have had the entire witness list and the 5 What we have been doing is notifying counsel the 6 day before who the witness -- who the next day's witnesses 7 are going to be. 8 The reason for this, as we've made clear, is 9 because the defendant has been violating the Order, 10 restricting extrajudicial speech. 11 And we did not want to have the witnesses' names, 12 the next witnesses' names out there. 15 That list includes Ms. Longstreet, who testified on 16 Friday, and all of the witnesses who will be testifying at 17 the trial.

18 I'm saying this because I don't like the impression 19 being left that we are somehow sandbagging the defense by 2498 1 exhibit list for a very long time.

2 Getting back to your Honor's question about 3 Ms. Longstreet. 4 We called her on Friday. 6 course, the Court has inherent authority to control the 7 order and the mechanics of witness examination during the 8 trial. 9 As you know, we learned Thursday that a juror had a 10 medical appointment or issue that required early departure 11 on Friday. 12 There were certain aspects of Ms. Longstreet's 13 testimony that needed to come in before Hope Hicks could 14 testify. 15 And so, we called her and truncated her direct 16 examination so that we could get her off the stand and get 17 Ms. Hicks on the stand so that we could, hopefully, finish 18 her and not have to get her back today, because the juror 19 had to leave. 22 had to leave sometime between 3:30 and 3:45. 24 notified -- we put on the record at a bench conference that 25 we intended to recall her. 20 And as you recall, we timed that pretty closely. 21 I think we ended on Friday at 3:30, and the juror 5 As you remember, and let me just first say that, of 23 So, shortly after, we discussed Ms. Longstreet. We 2499 1 I don't think that there is any remote prejudice 2 that the defense will suffer from allowing us to recall her 3 for these limited purposes, which, as I said, include some 4 additional Tweets that were not relevant to Ms. Hicks' 5 testimony, but are relevant to a subsequent witness' 6 testimony.

7 And then to have -- really, the bulk of her 8 testimony will involve going through the exhibit that had 9 been the subject of a lot of back and forth about which 10 portions were appropriate to redact. 11 And I believe at the time that we finalized that, 12 we indicated that we would use a summary witness to read 13 those texts. 14 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche.

15 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I'm looking at the 16 January 29th, 2024 witness list.

17 And I -- Ms. Longstreet is not on it.

18 I'm happy to be told I'm wrong, but that's what I 19 am referencing when I said that to the Court that I didn't 20 have her name. 21 Secondly, I did not say to the Court at sidebar 22 that we did not the know the exhibits. I said we did not 23 know which exhibits the People were going to offer with 24 respect to this witness.

25 She's not on it.

2500 1 And so, the point was that when they told us 2 included on the witness list was a custodian from the X 3 Corp, and a custodian from Truth Social -- so, when we 4 learned that she was going to be testifying and getting 10 We then performed the cross, assuming those were 11 the exhibits she was going to offer.

12 As the Court is aware, part of the cross was that, 13 I think the point was that of the however many thousands of 14 social media posts she was tasked with reviewing, the 15 witness testified to only seven or nine, whatever the 16 numbers were that she was asked to identify and admitted in 17 evidence.

18 I did not know at the time, because no one told us 19 what was just said today, was that there was timing and 20 scheduling issues and so they only intended to call this 21 witness to get a few exhibits in and then they intended to 22 recall her. 23 That's not the way it's supposed to work. 24 And I agree with the People that it's absolutely 25 within your discretion under the rules, under Rule 107.

6 prepared a cross based upon our understanding of what she 7 was going to be allowed to admit. 8 We didn't know, like I said, her name until 9 Wednesday afternoon.

5 those exhibits in, as your Honor knows, we objected, and we 2501 1 But, if you look at the cases, to the extent that 2 there are cases on this issue, the reasons given for 3 recalling a witness, at least that I have found, do not 4 include a summary witness who they call just to get some 5 stuff in, not tell anybody they're going to recall them, and 8 THE COURT: Let me ask you, what's the prejudice 9 to you?

10 MR. BLANCHE: The cross itself is the prejudice, 11 your Honor. 12 We crossed the witness and said -- and asked her 13 about all -- like I just said, it turns out that was totally 14 wrong, it turns out that there are more exhibits that she 15 was asked to offer and admit into evidence. 16 And, again, she's doing this as an employee of the 17 District Attorney's Office, not as a custodian of X or Truth 18 Social. 19 THE COURT: I'm not really following. 20 If she takes the stand and she testifies as to 21 additional Tweets and Truths and it's a summary witness for 22 Exhibit 171A, what is the prejudice to the defendant? 23 MR. BLANCHE: The cross-examination of her on 24 Friday included, in part, your Honor, the fact that she was 25 only being asked about seven to nine, after reviewing 6 then after the witness leaves, the stand and say: Oh, we're 7 going to recall her.

2502 1 thousands of social media posts by President Trump.

7 well, that it turns out that there was a wrong amount, it 8 turns out that there were other ones. 9 THE COURT: How many more are we talking about?

10 MR. STEINGLASS: Three. 11 THE COURT: Three? 12 MR. BLANCHE: But, your Honor, I'm not sure why 13 that matters, your Honor. 14 Again -- 15 THE COURT: Well, it matters. 16 MR. BLANCHE: She said that's all there was. 17 THE COURT: It matters that you are saying that 18 there's prejudice, that somehow you look bad, that it's 19 somehow she had looked at thousands and she only found 20 seven. 21 Now you are saying the prejudice is that it really 22 wasn't the case, she's introducing more, but she's only 23 introducing three more. 24 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, think about what we were just 25 told, that they knew at the time, apparently on Friday, that 3 folks -- she said 10 or 15 other folks. The only evidence 4 that the People had asked her to admit and to offer and to 5 get into evidence were the seven that were admitted. 6 So, it certainly doesn't help our defense that, 2 And I believe she said, you know, however, other 2503 9 We found out about this witness, found out her name 10 on Wednesday. 11 THE COURT: Right. 12 When do you intend to call Ms. Longstreet? 13 MR. STEINGLASS: Well, we could have done it this 14 afternoon, but I think we should start with a new witness 15 who we will -- we have been, as a matter of courtesy -- we 16 were ordered not to provide counsel with the name of the 17 witnesses for the next day until the next afternoon.

18 I'll do so as soon as we are off the record, give 19 the name for the witness for tomorrow. 20 I think -- I don't think we will get to 21 Ms. Longstreet until Thursday or Friday. 22 THE COURT: All right. Well, I would like you to 23 give the defense 24 hours notice before you call 24 Ms. Longstreet. 25 MR. STEINGLASS: We can do that.

1 they were only going to use this witness to get in enough 2 exhibits to get them through Friday. 3 If they would have said that to us, which they 4 should have if that was their case, we could have adjusted 5 our cross accordingly. 6 I -- again, it matters. 7 We don't have any idea who the witness is tomorrow. 8 We still don't know.

2504 1 THE COURT: So that they can prepare.

2 And, also, let them know the exhibits which are 3 going to be produced so that they can prepare their cross 4 for that.

5 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

25 THE COURT: Right.

6 THE COURT: Now, generally speaking, how are we 7 doing on scheduling? 8 MR. STEINGLASS: Well... 9 THE COURT: You are doing well?

10 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. 11 THE COURT: Can you give me a little more than 12 that? 13 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. 14 I apologize for that, Judge.

15 Are you asking how much longer I think it's going 16 to be?

17 THE COURT: Very roughly.

18 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay. 19 I would say about two more weeks.

20 THE COURT: This week plus next week or? 21 MR. STEINGLASS: This week plus next week and 22 probably into the week after, but maybe only a day or two. 23 I think there are some Fridays that we are now off that we 24 were not originally off --
1 MR. STEINGLASS: -- that are coming up.

2505 2 So, the very, very rough estimate, I would say two 3 weeks from tomorrow, maybe. 4 THE COURT: All right.

5 And I won't hold you to that. 6 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay.

7 THE COURT: But, just by way of reminder, we are 20 8 not meeting on the 17th. 9 We are also not meeting on the 24th.

10 And then Monday, the 27th, is Memorial Day. 11 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

12 THE COURT: All right. 13 Anything else from the Defense? 14 MR. BLANCHE: No.

15 THE COURT: All right. 16 See you tomorrow.

17 (Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned 18 to Tuesday, May 7th, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.) 19 **********
