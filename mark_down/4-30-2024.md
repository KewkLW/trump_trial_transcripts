2 THE COURT: Good morning.

3 Please be seated.

4 THE CLERK: Calling from the Part 59 calendar, 5 calendar number 1 and 2, SMZ 71762 of '24 and SMZ 71764 of 6 '24. Donald Trump.

7 Appearances.

8 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 9 Steinglass, Becky Mangold, Susan Hoffinger, Christopher 10 Conroy, Matthew Colangelo and Katherine Ellis. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Good morning. I am Todd Blanche.

12 And I am joined by Emil Bove, Susan Necheles and Kendra 13 Wharton.

14 Good morning. 15 THE COURT: Good morning. 16 We have a couple of housekeeping matters first. 17 I know that both sides wanted to work something out 18 with the sound system.

19 It's my understanding that that is going to be 20 worked out? 21 There is a plan in place? 22 MR. STEINGLASS: I believe so. Yes, Judge.

23 MR. BLANCHE: Yes. I think we're working it out, 24 and we will try to be as efficient as we can and make it as 25 smooth as possible.

Page 1578 1 THE COURT: The second issue.

2 At the start of the trial, Mr. Blanche, you had 3 requested two days for high school graduations, one for 4 Mr. Trump and one for a colleague. 5 Can you tell me what those days were? 6 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

7 (Counsel confer.)
8 MR. BLANCHE: May 17th and June 3rd.

9 THE COURT: All right. We got through the jury 10 selection really quickly, I think we are ahead of schedule 11 and I think we have been moving well ahead since, so I don't 12 think that the May 17th date is a problem.

13 So Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date --
14 attend his son's graduation. 15 June 3rd, it's really up to you. I think, at that 16 point, the jury might be deliberating. It could be a 17 challenge.

18 MS. NECHELES: I understand, your Honor. And, of 19 course, if they are deliberating -- 20 THE COURT: And if they are not deliberating, I 21 think that that will be fine as well. 22 MS. NECHELES: Thank you.

23 THE COURT: I believe the clerk of the court called 24 the SMZs into the record. 25 Let the record reflect that I'm about to hand down Page 1579

1 the Court's decisions on the hearing that we had for 2 contempt, on SMZ-71762 of '24, which covered Counts 1 3 through 3.

4 The Court finds that the People have met their 5 burden of proof and demonstrated contempt as to the second
8 those two.

9 As to SMZ-71764 of '24, covering incidents 4 10 through 10, the Court finds the People have met their burden 11 as to all of those.

12 And the Court imposes a punishment of $1,000 on
13 each of those six.

14 I am handing down written decision copies for both 15 sides. 16 The details of the decision are in the written 17 decision.

18 (Handed.)
19 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you. 20 THE COURT: Anything else that I need to go over

21 before we get back to the witness?
22 MR. STEINGLASS: There are a few matters, Judge, 23 but I don't think that they necessarily have to be discussed 24 before the witness. 25 THE COURT: Okay.

7 Mr. Trump is fined a thousand dollars on each of

6 and third incident, but not as to the first.

3 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
4 BY MS. MANGOLD: 5 Q Good morning, Mr. Farro. 6 A Good morning.

7 Q Welcome back.

8 A Thank you.

9 Q So before we adjourned on Friday, I think you were 10 talking to the jury about a call from Michael Cohen that you 11 received on October 26th, 2016; is that right?

12 A That's correct.

13 Q And you testified that he was -- he had called to open 14 a new bank account for an entity called Essential Consultants 15 LLC; right? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q And we discussed a form that you called a KYC form?

18 A Yes.

19 Q I think you explained it stands for "Know Your 20 Customer?" 21 A Yes. 22 Q And is that an account opening document required by 23 First Republic Bank?

24 A Yes, it is. 25 Q Is that the only document that a client is required to Page 1582 1 submit to open a new bank account?

2 A No. They need to provide a master signature card, 3 which shows who the signers are on the account, as well as the
4 documentation to support, if it's a business account. 5 In this case, it was a LLC account, so they have to provide 6 us with the LLC documentation as well.

7 Q Can you remind everyone again what "LLC" stands for?

8 A Limited Liability Company.

9 MS. MANGOLD: Can we display People's Exhibit 371, 10 which is already in evidence. 11 (Displayed.)
12 THE COURT: For everyone; right?

13 MS. MANGOLD: For everybody, yes.

14 Q Can you see that on your screen, Mr. Farro? 15 A Yes, I can. 16 Q Is this a First Republic Bank email? 17 A Yes.

18 Q A series of emails?

19 A Yes, it is. 20 Q Could we focus on the top two emails in the chain, 21 please? 22 A Certainly.

23 Q Now, looking at the middle email. Who is that from?

24 A That's from Elizabeth Rappaport, who was my assistant. 25 Q Your assistant?

Page 1583 1 A Yes.

2 Q And who is it to? 5 Q And who is Melissa Duran? 6 A Melissa Duran worked in our Client Service Group, and 7 specifically handled some of the wire transactions.

8 Q And would you remind everyone who DeWitt Hutchins is?

9 A DeWitt Hutchins, at the time, was a preferred banker 10 working in the 56th and Madison office. 11 Q What is the date of this email?

12 A October 26th, 2016.

13 Q Is that the same day that Mr. Cohen called you to open 14 the Essential Consultants account? 15 A Yes, it is. 16 Q Can you read this email to the jury? 17 A "DeWitt - please provide the account docs for Michael 18 Cohen. Thank you."
19 Q I'm directing you to the top email on the page. Do you 20 see that there is an attachment? 21 A Yes, there is a PDF as well as another image. 22 MS. MANGOLD: And if we could briefly flip through 23 the remainder of this document.

24 (Displayed.) 25 Q Are Pages 3 through 9 of this PDF the other account 3 A It is to Melissa Duran, Client Service Group New York, 4 and DeWitt Hutchins.

Page 1584 1 opening documents for Essential Consultants LLC?

2 A Yes. This is what I referenced prior.

3 MS. MANGOLD: And can we turn now to Page 3 of the 4 PDF. 5 (Displayed.) 6 Q Focus on the top half of the page.

7 What is this document?

8 A This is the business signature card. This determines 9 who has the ability to sign on the account.

10 Q And it also contains an agreement to open accounts? 11 A Yes, it does.

12 Q What entity is this for?

13 A Essential Consultants LLC.

14 Q And if you look at the bottom of the box that we are 15 looking at, in the lower-most row, where it says "Type of 16 Business," what type of business is listed? 17 A Consulting.

18 Q And is that business type something that's provided by 19 the client in this case? 20 A Yes, it is. 21 Q And that's Mr. Cohen here? 22 A Yes. We asked for the purpose of the account and that 23 was the answer.

24 Q Was the purpose for the account given in this form 25 consistent with what Mr. Cohen told you on the phone call Page 1585 1 earlier that day?

2 A Yes, it is.

3 Q And is it consistent with the purpose of the account 4 stated in the Know Your Customer form that we looked at on 5 Friday? 6 A Yes, it is.

7 Q And if we scroll down a little bit to the middle 8 portion of the page. Who is listed as the authorized signers 9 for the account?

10 A Michael Cohen. 11 Q And any other authorized signers?

12 A No, there is not.

13 Q All right.

14 MS. MANGOLD: Can we turn to Page 4 of the PDF. 15 (Displayed.) 16 Q Is this another part of the same document that we just 17 looked at?

18 A Yes. This is the signature page of that document.

20 page? 19 Q Do you recognize the signature near the bottom of the 21 A Yes. It's Michael Cohen's. 22 Q And what's the date of that?

23 A 10/26/16.

24 Q And looking now at the box at the bottom of the page, 25 is there an account number provided?

Page 1586 1 A Yes, there is.

3 number?

2 Q And what are the last four digits of the account 4 A 1897. 5 Q And in the right-most column it says "open by." Who is 6 listed there?

7 A DeWitt Hutchins.

12 A Yes.

8 MS. MANGOLD: If we could flip to the following 9 page, Page 5 of the PDF.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q Do you recognize this document?

13 Q What is this?

14 A This is an addendum to the signature card. This kind 15 of gives the information on the authorized signer. 16 Q And this is another required document to open a bank 17 account?

18 A Yes, it is.

19 Q What is the account name listed at the top? 20 A Essential Consultants LLC. 21 Q And do you see a signature at the bottom? 22 A Yes. Michael Cohen's.

23 Q And what's the date?

24 A 10/26/16. 25 Q All right. Now, flipping through the last few pages of Page 1587 1 the PDF.

2 Are Pages 6 through 9 of the PDF -- well, what are these 3 documents?
4 A These are the opening of a LLC's accounts as well as 5 the tax ID number provided by the Internal Revenue Service. 6 Q Are these documents generated at First Republic Bank or 7 provided by the client?

8 A No, they are provided by the client. They are 9 generated by the IRS.

10 Q And turning now to Page 6 of the PDF. 11 What is this?

12 (Displayed.)
13 A This is -- the account was opened in Delaware, as most 14 LLCs are that I do business with. 15 And it's a Certificate of Formation of Essential 16 Consultants. 17 Q And what is the date and time that Essential 18 Consultants was formed?

19 A October 17th, 2016 at 10:21 a.m. 20 Q And just for -- in the interest of clarity, is this 21 provided by the IRS or some other entity? 22 A My understanding is it's provided by -- the tax ID is 23 provided by the IRS. And this is provided by the State of 24 Delaware. 25 MS. MANGOLD: If we could flip to Page 7 of the Page 1588 1 PDF please.

2 (Displayed.)
3 Q What is this?

4 A This is the State of Delaware's Limited Liability 5 Company formation doc, and it shows Michael Cohen as the 6 authorized person.

7 MS. MANGOLD: And then, finally, flipping to -- if 8 we can flip through Page 8 to Page 9 of the PDF; and 9 focusing on the bottom of the page.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q Is this the document that you referenced earlier was 12 issued by the IRS?

13 A Yes.

14 Q And this has an Employer Identification Number? 15 A Yes. 16 Q What is that? 17 A It's essentially -- to equate it to something, it's 18 like the Social Security number for businesses. It's a tax ID
19 for businesses. 20 Q All right. 21 MS. MANGOLD: Can we take that down. 22 Now can we display to everyone what is admitted in 23 evidence as People's 370.

24 (Displayed.) 25 Q Is this another set of First Republic Bank emails?

Page 1589 1 A Yes, it is.

2 Q Who is on these emails?

3 A Myself and DeWitt Hutchins.

4 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the bottom portion 5 of the page, please. 6 (Displayed.)
7 Q Who is this email from?

8 A DeWitt to the myself.

9 Q What's the subject?

10 A "Michael Cohen." 11 Q And can you read the first line of the email, please?

12 A Sure.

13 "Account is good to go - gave him wire instructions and 14 ordered checks." 15 Q What did you understand "good to go" to mean? 16 A It means that it's open and ready to be funded. 17 Q And based on the date of the email and who it's from, 18 do you know what account this is referencing?

19 A Essential Consultants LLC. 20 Q Now, looking at the date and time above, did DeWitt 21 send this on the same day that you received the call from 22 Mr. Cohen?

23 A Yes.

24 Q And you spoke to Mr. Cohen that morning about opening 25 this account?

Page 1590 1 A That's correct.

2 Q What's the date stamp of this email?

3 A Oh, the date, excuse me, October 26th, 2016.

4 Q I'm sorry, the time stamp of the email? 5 A Okay. 2:35 p.m. 6 Q So about how long did it take to open the account 7 between the time that Mr. Cohen called you and the time that 8 Mr. Hutchins confirmed that the account was opened?

9 A Five to six hours or so.

10 Q Did Mr. Cohen indicate that opening this account was 11 urgent when he called you?

12 A Yes. Michael Cohen -- everything was urgent with 13 Michael Cohen.

14 Q So why did it take five or six hours to open the 15 account? 16 A Michael Cohen's not our only client, so we do have 17 other things that take precedence. Moving in and opening an 18 account in a singular day is considered very quick.

19 Q Is that because there is some processes that the bank 20 needs to undertake in order for the account to be opened? 21 A Absolutely. 22 Q And does that require certain checks by the back 23 office, is -- I think you called it?

24 A Correct. As well as data entry, getting the paperwork 25 back, et cetera.

Page 1591 1 Q So we've now looked at the account opening documents 2 for Essential Consultants in some detail; right?

3 A Yes.

4 Q Probably more detail than anybody wanted. 5 A (Laughter.) 6 Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate the 7 account would be used to make a payment on behalf of a political 8 candidate?

9 A No.

10 Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be 11 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated the account would be used 12 to make a payment on behalf of a political candidate?

13 A There would be additional scrutiny.

14 Q And what do you mean by that? 15 A It would reach the second line of defense. 16 Q Would that have delayed the opening of the account? 17 A Quite possibly.

18 Q Is it possible that the account wouldn't have been 19 opened at all? 20 A It's possible. 21 Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate that 22 the account would be used to buy the rights to a media story?

24 Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be 25 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the account would be 23 A No.

Page 1592 1 used to buy the rights to a media story?

2 A Not necessarily, but we would certainly ask additional 3 questions.

4 Q Was that consistent with the stated purpose of the 5 account on the phone call to you, that it was for real estate? 6 A That would not be consistent with what it was, and 7 that's why we would ask additional questions.

10 A No. 14 A Absolutely. 15 Q How would it be different? 16 A Well, we would certainly ask additional questions. 17 It's not our money to determine where it goes; however, it is an 18 industry that we do not work with, so there would be a 19 determination made by the second and third line of defense if it 20 was something that we would move forward on. 21 Q And that would have delayed opening the account? 22 A That would certainly have delayed it.

23 Q And is it possible that the account wouldn't have been 24 opened at all? 25 A Yes, it is.

8 Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate the 9 account would be used to pay an adult film star?

11 Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be 12 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the account would be 13 used to pay an adult film star?

Page 1593 1 Q All right. Looking back at this email from 2 Mr. Hutchins.

3 Can you read the bottom portion of the email?

4 (Displayed.) 5 A "Said he would swing by here in a little bit. Thanks." 6 Q Who did you understand "he" to be in that sentence?

7 A Michael Cohen.

8 Q And why would Mr. Cohen swing by the bank if the 9 account was already opened?

10 A Because he needed to fund the account for it to be 11 live.

12 Q He had to put money into the account for the account to 13 actually be fully opened?

14 A That's correct. 15 Q All right. 16 MS. MANGOLD: Can we turn to what's already in 17 evidence as People's Exhibit 372.

18 (Displayed.)
19 MS. MANGOLD: Can we focus on the bottom two emails 20 on the page. 21 (Displayed.) 22 Q Are these First Republic Bank emails?

23 A Yes.

24 Q Turning now to the bottom email on the page. Who is 25 that from and to?

Page 1594 1 A Elizabeth Rappaport to Michael Cohen.

2 Q What is the subject of the email?

3 A The subject is "First Republic Bank Transfer."
4 Q And what is the date and time of this? 5 A October 26th, 2016 at 2:53 p.m. 6 Q And the last email that we saw was 2:35 that same day; 7 is that correct?

8 A That's correct.

9 Q And so what was the approximate time between that last 10 email and this email that was sent? 11 A Oh, 23 minutes.

12 Q Good math.

13 Do you see something called "Importance" at the bottom of 14 the top box of the email? 15 A Yes. It's of high importance. 16 Q And do you know what that is -- like, what that 17 designation indicates?

18 A That something needs to be done quickly.

19 Q Can you read the body of the email to the jury? 20 A "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. Per our conversation over 21 the phone, please confirm your request to transfer $131,000 from 24 Q Is the account ending in 1897 the same account that was 25 set up for Essential Consultants --
22 your home equity line of credit account number ending in 6194 to 23 your checking account ending in 1897."
Page 1595 1 A Yes, it is.

2 Q -- that you discussed with us earlier?

3 A Yes, it is.

4 Q And when you say "home equity line of credit," is that 5 also referred to as a HELOC? 6 A Yes, it is.

7 Q What is a HELOC?

8 A A home equity line of credit is a revolving mortgage 9 that's put on your home.

10 What I mean by "revolving" is essentially you can pay down 11 on it at any time and repay it and then draw down on it again.

12 It could be considered as a credit card, with your home as 13 collateral. That's another good way to explain it.

14 Q Is it fair to say that it's mostly like a second 15 mortgage? 16 A It is a second mortgage, but it can be put in first 17 position as well. For clarification purposes, it is a mortgage 18 that you are allowed to draw upon.

19 Q And, in this case, do you know if it was a second 20 mortgage? 21 A It was a second mortgage in this scenario, yes. 22 Q Can you explain what's going on in this email?

23 A Sure. Obviously, a conversation was -- had taken place 24 between Elizabeth and Michael where he had asked to drawdown on 25 his home equity line of credit to fund the account at Essential Page 1596 1 Consultants.

2 Q What's the next email in the chain?

3 A It says "Confirmed."
4 Q Is that sent by Michael Cohen? 5 A That was sent by Michael Cohen to Lizzie. 6 Q And how long after the first email was that sent?

7 A One minute.

8 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top email in the 9 chain.

10 Q Who is this email to and from? 11 A This is from Elizabeth Rappaport to our Client Service 12 Group.

13 Q And what is the date and time stamp of the top email?

14 A This is 10/26/2016, 11:56 a.m. 15 Q And can you explain, again, to the jury how the time 16 stamps work in the First Republic email? 17 A Yes. The very top, when you are pulling the email 18 system, is in Pacific Time. Everything below it is stuck in 19 Eastern Standard Time. 20 Q And does this also have an importance designation? 21 A Yes, it does. 22 Q And what is it?

23 A "High."
24 Q Can you read this email to the jury? 25 A "Please transfer $131,000 from HELOC account ending in Page 1597

1 6194 to checking account ending in 1897. Please note this is a 2 time-sensitive request. Please confirm once complete."
3 Q When Ms. Rappaport says "it's a time-sensitive
4 request," is that something that would come from Ms. Rappaport 5 or from the client? 6 A In this scenario, it could be from either.

7 And the reason why I say that is because this is now 8 2:56 p.m. and the wire cut off time is 3:00 p.m., so my 9 assumption would be it started with -- with Michael saying it's 10 urgent, because he did in a prior email; however, that would be 11 purely an assumption.

12 Q And when you say "the wire cut off," what does that 13 mean?

14 A At 3:00 p.m. is when the wires have to be sent out to 15 be received same day. 16 Q Would that impact this HELOC transfer? 17 A Well, if the HELOC transfer is not done, the wire 18 cannot be done.

19 Q Is that reference to a subsequent wire after the 20 transfer from the HELOC?

24 Q So was it your understanding that after this account 25 was funded, Mr. Cohen wanted to subsequently send a wire 21 A Well, a transfer from a HELOC is not a wire so it's a 22 bank transfer; so it transfers over and then the wire would be 23 the secondary move that went to someone else.

Page 1598 1 transfer out using that account --
2 A That's correct.

3 Q -- later that day?

23 yes.

| 12  | A                             | This is an advance request for a line of credit.    |
| 13  | Q                             | Do you know what this advance request was for?      |
| 14  | A                             | This was for the home equity line.                  |
| 15  | Q                             | That's Mr. Cohen's home equity line?                |

| 17  | Q                             | Looking now at the top half of the page?            |
| 19  | Q                             | What is the request type?                           |
| 21  | Q                             | That means he is borrowing money?                   |
| 22  | A                             | That means he's drawing down on the line of credit, |

5 Q All right.

10 A I do. 11 Q What is this?

18 A Uh-huh.

20 A Is "advance."

25 A $131,000.

Page 1599 1 Q And who is the borrower?

2 A The borrower is Michael Cohen or Laura Cohen.

3 Q Do you know who Laura Cohen is?

4 A Michael's spouse. 5 Q And why are both of their names listed? 6 A Both of their names are listed on the home equity line 7 of credit.

8 Q And where is this transfer from and to?

9 A It is from the line of credit and ending in 6194, and 10 it's being credited to the new account for Essential Consultants 11 ending in 1897.

12 Q And looking at the effective date on the right, is 13 that the same date that Michael Cohen called you to open the 14 account? 15 A Yes, 10/26/16. 16 MS. MANGOLD: And can we look at the bottom half of 17 the page, please.

18 (Displayed.)
19 Q Does this indicate that this transfer had to be 20 approved by people at First Republic Bank? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And how many people at First Republic Bank had to 23 approve this?

25 Q And those are their names listed there? 24 A In this scenario, two.

Page 1600 1 A Yes, Melissa Duran and Mark Stewart.

2 Q All right.

3 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please take a look at 4 People's Exhibit 374 already in evidence. 5 (Displayed.) 6 Q What is this?

7 A This is an email from Melissa Duran to the Loan 8 Servicing Department requesting the advance.

9 Q I'm sorry, the Loan Servicing Department is part of 10 First Republic Bank? 11 A Part of our back office operations, yes.

12 Q And that's different from the Client Service Group?

13 A Yes, it is.

14 Q What is the subject? 15 A The subject is "Advance 6194, OSI. Please expedite 17 Q And is there an importance designation in this email?

18 A Yes. "High."
19 Q Can you read this email to the jury? 20 A "My client Michael Cohen or Laura Cohen is requesting 21 an advance in the amount of $131,000. Please expedite pending 22 wire. Thank you. Melissa Duran."
23 Q And can you explain what's going on in this email?

24 A Yes. So an advance has to be done by our Loan 25 Servicing Department. It's another part of our checks and 16 pending wire."
Page 1601 1 balances. So it goes to the Loan Servicing from our Client 2 Service Group to drawdown and make the deposit.

3 Q All right. And this is the internal bank communication 4 to get that done? 5 A Yes, it is. 6 MS. MANGOLD: Can we now take a look at People's 7 Exhibit 375 already in evidence.

8 (Displayed.)
9 Q Take a look at the bottom two emails on this page. Are 10 these First Republic Bank emails? 11 A Yes, they are.

12 Q Looking at the bottom-most email on the page. Is this 13 an email that we've already seen?

14 A Yes, it is. 15 Q What's this email at the bottom? 16 A Pardon me? 17 Q What is the email at the bottom?

18 A Oh, this is the requesting the transfer and the 19 drawdown on the HELOC account and then depositing it into the 20 Essential Consultants account. 21 Q Now, looking at the next email in the chain. Who is 22 this to and from?

23 A It's from Michael Cohen to Elizabeth Rappaport.

24 Q Can you read this email? 25 A "Can you please send me confirmation that the funds Page 1602 1 were deposited into the other account? Important."
2 Q And do you have an understanding of what this means?

3 A Yes. This is stating that he's asking if the $131,000 4 was deposited into Essential Consultants. 5 Q Did he explain to you why this was important? 6 A He did not explain to me directly why this was 7 important. I did not speak to him after that initial call.

8 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top email on the 9 page, please.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q Who is this to and from?

12 A From Elizabeth Rappaport to Michael Cohen.

13 Q And what's the date and time?

14 A The date is 10/26/2016 at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. 15 Q That's 4:15 Eastern? 16 A Yes, it is. 17 Q Can you read the email to the jury?

18 A "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. The funds have been 19 deposited into your account ending in 1897." 20 Q And what does that mean? 21 A That means that the drawdown on the home equity line of 22 credit has been completed and it has been deposited into the now 23 Essential Consultants account that was established that day.

24 Q Does that mean the Essential Consultants account is now 25 fully funded?

Page 1603 1 A Fully funded and live for business.

2 Q Officially open?

3 A Yes.

4 Q All right. Now, let's take a look at what's already in 5 evidence as People's Exhibit 376. 6 (Displayed.)
7 Q Do you recognize this document?

8 A Yes, I do.

9 Q What type of document is this?

10 A This is a Wire Authorization form. 11 Q What is a Wire Authorization form?

12 A This gives us the right to send the wire when we are in 13 person with the client.

14 Q And just in case there is anybody who doesn't know what 15 a wire is, what is a wire? 16 A A wire is an electronic way of moving funds from one 17 party to another party.

18 Q Focusing now on the top half of the page.

20 Q Can you see where the wire transfer is coming from? 21 A Are you talking about -- who the originator is of the 22 wire?

23 Q Yes.

24 A It's Essential Consultants LLC. 25 Q And on the top right-hand side of the page does it say 19 (Displayed.)
Page 1604 1 who prepared this Wire Transfer Authorization Agreement form?

2 A Yes. DeWitt Hutchins.

3 Q DeWitt Hutchins. Would he fill that out with input 4 from the originator? 5 A Yes. 6 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look now at the bottom box on 7 the page.

8 (Displayed.)
10 filled out?

9 Q Can you tell when this Wire Authorization form was 11 A Yes. 10/27/2016 at 10:01 a.m.

12 Q And can you tell whether the client did this remotely 14 A He did it in person. 15 Q Is that indicated there on the left? 16 A Yes.

18 box?

17 Q And do you recognize the signature or initials in this 19 A Which box? 20 Q Below the date and time stamp. I'm sorry. 21 A Yeah, that is DeWitt Hutchins's signature. 22 Q So is this then the following morning after the account 23 had been opened?

24 A This is the following morning, yes. 25 Q All right. Let's go back to the top of the page. Can 13 or at the bank?

Page 1605 1 you see the amount of the wire transfer here?

2 (Displayed.)
3 A $130,000.

4 Q And can you see the last four digits of the Essential 5 Consultants account where the wire would be coming from? 6 A 1897.

7 Q And is that the same account that was just opened the 9 A Yes, it is.

10 Q Now, looking at the middle portion of the page. The 11 font is very small, but can you see what's listed in the 12 beneficiary line of the form?

13 A Yes, I can. It's Keith M. Davidson and Associates PLC
14 Attorney Client Trust Account. 15 Q Do you know what an Attorney Client Trust Account is? 16 A It's an account that's held by attorneys on behalf of 17 one of their clients.

20 A That's correct. 21 Q And if you look at the section called "F. Purpose of 22 Wire Being Sent," what does it say there?

23 A It says "Retainer."
24 Q Why does the bank ask for the purpose of the wire being 25 sent?

18 Q So not going to the attorney directly, it's being held 19 for somebody that they represent?

8 prior day?

Page 1606 1 A To ensure that we're not doing anything that would be 2 outside of the scope that we would want to do.

3 Q And who provides the information here?

4 A That's provided by the client. 5 Q And who is that in this case? 6 A Michael Cohen.

7 Q Do you know what a retainer is?

8 A A retainer is money that is given to another individual 9 in advance of business that -- or work that is to be done.

10 Q And is a wire for a retainer to an attorney for the 11 attorney's client consistent with the stated purpose of the 12 account for real estate consulting?

13 A It certainly could be, yes.

14 Q And can you elaborate on that a little bit more? 15 A I could only make suggestions on what it could be for; 16 however, a retainer could be held for individuals who are doing 17 appraisals for other parts of the business, doing an analysis on 18 a cash flow statement if it's a multi-family business.

19 There could be a number of things why a retainer would be 20 given from one attorney to another for a real estate 21 transaction. 22 Q And you are basing that from your experience with 23 working with real estate clients?

24 A Yes, for over 20 years. 25 Q Now, looking at the portion just below this on the Page 1607 1 form, below the double line. Do you see that fine print above 2 the signature line?

3 A I do.

4 Q What does the first sentence of that say? 5 A "I/we certify that the information contained herein is 6 true, complete and accurate."
7 Q And do you recognize the signature?

8 A Yes. "Michael Cohen."
9 Q And what's the date?

10 A 10/27/2016. 11 Q Are there two more signatures below that?

12 A Yes.

13 Q Do you know who those signatures are from?

14 A Yes. DeWitt Hutchins and Andrea Wang. 15 Q And are both DeWitt Hutchins and Andrea Wang First 16 Republic Bank personnel? 17 A Yes. They both worked in the same office.

18 Q And does this indicate that multiple people from the 19 bank had to approve this wire before it was sent out? 20 A Yes. Wire approval requires certain levels. Each 21 person has a level of allowance, if you will, on what they are 22 allowed to do as a singular signer; and given that it is over 23 $100,000, it requires two signatures.

24 Q Now, turning to Page 3 of the same PDF. 25 (Displayed.)
Page 1608 1 Q Do you know what this is?

2 A Looks like wire instructions that were provided by 3 Davidson and Associates.

4 Q And who was Davidson and Associates for the purposes of 5 this wire transfer? 6 A He was the beneficiary of the wire that was being sent 7 by Michael Cohen.

8 Q All right.

9 MS. MANGOLD: Let's take a look now at what's 10 already in evidence as People's Exhibit 377. 11 (Displayed.)
12 Q Do you recognize this document?

13 A I do.

14 Q What kind of document is this? 15 A This is an Outgoing Wire Transfer form. It's an 16 internal document. 17 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top half of the 18 page, please.

19 (Displayed.) 20 Q Now, what stage in the wire transfer did the bank fill 21 out this form? 22 A This form is when it's physically input into the 23 system, this is what comes out.

24 Q Is this confirmation that the wire transfer has already 25 gone out?

Page 1609 1 A I do not see a number on it; however, this is if --
2 that it has been input. The confirmation would be something 3 different.

4 Q Okay. What is the date and time of this form? 5 A This is 7:20 a.m., but that's Pacific Time, so it's 6 10:20 a.m. And it's on 10/27/2016.

7 Q And looking now at the amount and customer name at the 8 top, is this the same wire that we just looked at from Essential 9 Consultants?

10 A Yes, it appears that way. 11 Q And do you see --
12 MS. MANGOLD: If we could zoom out.

13 (Displayed.)
14 Q There is handwriting on the right side of the page. Do 15 you know what that handwriting is? 16 A It looks like it has been initialed by Andrea Wang. 17 Q And that's somebody, again, who works at the bank?

18 A Yes.

19 Q All right. 22 (Displayed.)
23 Q Can you describe what this is?

24 A This is an email from DeWitt Hutchins to Michael Cohen 21 evidence as People's Exhibit 378. 20 MS. MANGOLD: Let's turn now to what's already in 25 with the confirmation that the wire has been executed and is on Page 1610 1 its way.

2 Q And based on the time stamp and who the email is to and

3 from what wires, what do you understand this to be a reference
4 to? 5 A This is the reference to the wire that was being sent 6 to Davidson and Associates.

7 Q And what date and time -- is there a confirmation of 8 the wire that went out?

9 A 10/27/2016 at 10:50 a.m. Eastern Time; 7:50 a.m.

10 Pacific Time. 11 Q All right.

12 MS. MANGOLD: Lastly, can we look at People's 13 Exhibit 379 already in evidence.

14 (Displayed.) 15 Q What type of document is this? 16 A This is a banking account statement. 17 Q And is it a banking account statement from First 18 Republic Bank?

19 A Yes. 20 Q Can you look at the top portion of the page, please. 21 What account is this an account statement for? 22 A Essential Consultants LLC.

23 Q And what are the last four digits of the account 24 number? 25 A 1897.

Page 1611 1 Q Now, if you look above that, there is a portion called 2 "Statement Period."
3 What are the dates of the statement period?

4 A October 26th, 2016 to October 31st, 2016. 5 Q Is it typical to have a statement period that's only 6 five days?

7 A No, it's usually a 30-day statement.

8 Q Do you know why this is five days?

9 A Because the cut-off period is -- we would issue a 10 statement regardless of what day you opened it during the month 11 to maintain the schedule of you receiving it the first of every 12 month.

13 Q So did the account exist before October 26th, 2016?

14 A No. That's why it started on October 26th. 15 MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the bottom two-thirds 16 of the page, please. 17 (Displayed.)
18 Q Can you explain what is described under "Account 19 Activity?" 20 A Yes. So you will have the deposits and credits and 21 withdrawals and debits. 22 The first being a deposit from the credit on an advance on 23 the home equity line of credit on 6194 for $131,000.

24 And then on the bottom, a domestic wire transfer to Keith M. 25 Davidson and Associates for $130,000. And then a $35 fee for Page 1612 1 that transaction.

2 Q And then the date to the left of that $131,000 credit 3 is the same date that Mr. Cohen called you to open the account; 4 right? 5 A That's correct. 6 Q And the wire out is on the subsequent day?

7 A That's correct.

8 Q So did all of the Essential Consultants transactions 9 that we just looked at take place in that approximately 24-hour 10 period? 11 A Yes, it did.

12 Q And that includes opening the account, funding the 13 account with the HELOC, and transferring the wire to 14 Mr. Davidson; right? 15 A In fact, it starts from an initial phone call to open 16 the account, to funding the account, to the wiring out the 17 money.

18 Q Now, is that timing typical for a real estate 19 transaction? 20 A It's not atypical. 21 Wires -- you know, real estate transactions for people who 22 own significant amounts of real estate, they like to move very 23 quickly because, opportunistically, it locks it up and that way 24 they can avoid getting other bids; or quickly getting into 25 attorney review, which, essentially, would take it off the Page 1613 1 market.

2 Q Having now looked at the wire transfer paperwork for 3 the amount, timing and description of the wire, are they all 4 consistent with using this account and sending that wire as a 5 real estate transaction? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And that had to be approved by the bank?

8 A All wires have to be approved by the bank.

10 money was being transferred on behalf of a political candidate? 11 A No.

12 Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire 13 transfer be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the money 14 was being transferred on behalf of a political candidate? 15 A We would have additional due diligence. 16 Q Would that have delayed the transaction? 17 A It certainly could.

20 A No.

18 Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that 19 money was being transferred to buy the rights to a media story?

24 A Possibly, yeah.

21 Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire be 22 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the payment was being 23 made to buy the rights to a media story?

9 Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that 25 Q Could that have delayed the transaction?

Page 1614 1 A It would have because additional questions would have 2 been asked at that time.

3 Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that 4 money was being transferred for the payment to an adult film 5 star? 6 A It did not.

7 Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire be 8 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the wire transfer was 9 a payment to an adult film star?

10 A Yes, there would definitely be enhanced due diligence 11 on that.

12 Q By "enhanced due diligence," you mean further checks by 13 the bank?

14 A Correct. 15 Q Would that have delayed the transaction? 16 A It certainly would have. 17 Q Is it possible that the wire wouldn't have been 18 approved at all by the bank?

19 A Yes. If we -- if it was something like that, we might 20 be -- that our reputation is at risk, and we might not have 21 wanted to send the wire. 22 MS. MANGOLD: I have no further questions.

23 THE COURT: Thank you.

24 Any cross? 25 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

Page 1615 1 *****
2 CROSS EXAMINATION
3 BY MR. BLANCHE:
4 Q Good morning. How are you? 5 A Good morning, sir. 6 Q You -- my name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never 7 met; correct?

8 A We have not.

9 Q And you testified on Friday, I believe, that you are 10 here pursuant to a subpoena from the People, but you initially 11 were cooperative and had no reason to not be cooperative with 12 the People; correct?

13 A That's correct.

17 A Please explain what "the People" means?

18 Q I'm sorry. The folks at this table. Maybe they are 19 not at this table, but folks that worked at the Manhattan 20 District Attorney's office? 21 A Yes, sir. 22 Q Approximately how many occasions did you meet with the 23 Manhattan District Attorney's office?

24 A Twice. 25 Q When were those occasions?

14 Q And you and I have never met before, but you met with 15 the People on several occasions before you testified on Friday 16 and today; correct?

Page 1616 2 dates.

1 A Over the last month or two. I don't know the exact 3 Q So, recently, you met with them twice. But you also 4 met with them last year; didn't you? 5 A I did not meet with the same people last year. 6 Q Did you meet with other folks who worked for the 7 Manhattan District Attorney's office last year?

8 A I did.

9 Q And even if it wasn't the same people that you met with 10 over the past two months, on how many occasions last year did 11 you meet with the Manhattan District Attorney's office?

12 A I believe it was one time.

13 Q Aside from the times you just testified about, so a 14 couple of times this year, one time last year, did you meet with 15 any other law enforcement about the subject of your testimony 16 today? 17 A Yes, I did.

19 A The -- I was in Washington to discuss the same matter. 20 Q In Washington D.C.? 21 A Correct. 22 Q And when was that?

23 A I believe this -- and I could be wrong on the date, 25 Q And in 2018, '19, on how many occasions did you go to 18 Q Who?

24 it's 2018, '19.

Page 1617 1 D.C. to meet with the prosecutors?

2 A I believe it was twice.

3 Q The same trip or two separate occasions?

4 A No, two separate occasions. 5 Q During all of the times that you just talked about, so 6 D.C. on two separate occasions, last year a couple of times --
7 I'm sorry, last year one time and then this year a couple of 8 times, you were represented by counsel; correct?

9 A Yes, I was.

10 Q And you are not paying for your own lawyers; right? 11 A I am not.

12 Q Who is paying for your lawyers, Chase?

13 A Well, when I went to D.C., it was paid by First 14 Republic. 15 And when -- now it's being paid by Flagstone, my new 17 Q So when -- but Chase took over First Republic after the 18 collapse, I believe you testified; correct?

19 A That's correct. 20 Q So prior to the collapse, First Republic was paying for 21 your lawyers? 22 A That's correct.

23 Q And that's because this is completely about your 24 professional job; correct? 25 A Is it what completely about?

16 institution.

Page 1618 1 Q That's because the reason why you are testifying has to 2 do with your professional job, nothing to do with anything 3 personal; correct?

4 A That's correct. 5 Q So just to remind everybody, because we had a long 6 weekend, you were at First Republic Bank from 2008 until March 7 of last year, 2023; correct?

8 A That's correct.

9 Q And you were promoted along the way, eventually 10 becoming a Senior Managing Director? 11 A I was promoted even further than that after that, yes.

12 Q So what were you promoted to after Senior Managing 13 Director?

14 A Executive Managing Director. 16 Director? 15 Q So when you left last year, you were Executive Managing 17 A That's correct, yes.

18 Q And when you were assigned the Michael Cohen 19 relationship in 2015, at that point you were a Senior Managing 20 Director already? 22 Q And you didn't do account opening for Mr. Cohen, he was 23 already a First Republic client; correct?

24 A I didn't do account opening for anyone. I provided 25 advice to clients.

21 A Yes.

Page 1619 1 I don't do the actual, physical paperwork.

2 Q But whenever Mr. Cohen was onboarded at First Republic, 3 you were not part of that process?

4 A Not part of the paperwork process. I would have 5 conversations about the types of accounts and provide advice, 6 but not necessarily on the account opening paperwork.

7 Q Do you know how long Mr. Cohen had been a First 8 Republic client before you took over the relationship with him?

9 A I recall 2012 being a possibility of when he 10 established a relationship initially, but I could be wrong. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Can we put up what has already been 12 admitted in evidence as People's Exhibit 368, so everybody 13 can take a look at that.

14 (Displayed.) 15 Q If you -- this is one of the documents that you looked 16 at last week. 17 If we look at, towards the bottom of this document, there is 18 a series of questions at the bottom right.

19 If you see, it says, "Referral source's length of 20 relationship with the bank." 21 And it says, "five years?" 22 And then if we could look at the top of that same document, 23 I believe this document was updated in October of 2016.

24 Do you see that? 25 A Yes, so that would be 2011.

Page 1620 1 Q All right. 2011.

2 And, by the way, you have no reason to believe that there is 3 anything inaccurate about that, it's about five years?

4 A No. 5 Q And so, again, you testified on Friday that when you 6 were given the Mr. Cohen assignment, you were told that 7 Mr. Cohen could be -- was difficult; is that fair?

8 A Yes. He was a challenging client because of his desire 9 to get things done so quickly.

10 Q Do you remember the first time you spoke with 11 Mr. Cohen?

12 A I do.

13 Q Can you tell us about that?

14 A Yes. I -- excuse me, pardon me for a second. 15 (Pause.) 16 I was brought to Michael Cohen's office with my boss at the 17 time for an introduction.

18 Q And that's the office at the Trump Tower?

19 A That's correct. 20 Q So the initial communication with him was in person, 21 but I believe over the course of the relationship, did you 22 mostly talk on the phone with him?

23 A Yes.

24 Q Or meet him in person? 25 A It was mostly over the phone.

Page 1621 1 Q That would be not frequently, a few times a year; is 2 that fair?

3 A Yeah, it was an infrequent thing, you know, it would 4 maybe be three, four times a year. 5 Q And the types of conversations you would have with him 6 had to do with, for example, opening a new account or having a 7 fee waived or something, some general type of work like that; is 8 that fair?

9 A Yes, that's correct.

13 A Within a short walking distance, yes.

16 A That's correct. 17 Q Now, you testified that every time you spoke -- well, 18 that when you spoke with Michael Cohen, everything was urgent; 19 is that a fair way to describe it? 20 A So 90 percent of the time it was an urgent matter, 21 yes. 22 Q You -- is it true that when you first were assigned 23 Mr. Cohen, your leadership team told you that you were picked 24 to take over the relationship because you were firm with 25 clients?

10 Q You testified that he did a lot of his own business and 11 one of the reasons was because there was actually a branch right 12 across from Trump Tower; is that right?

14 Q And folks there, the Client Services team could handle 15 most of the stuff that Mr. Cohen needed; right?

Page 1622 1 A Yes.

2 Q And that you don't accept any nonsense from clients; 3 correct?

4 A Well, not that I don't accept any nonsense, it's just 5 that I, I try to rationalize with clients that things -- that 6 certain things aren't as urgent as they may seem.

7 Q And Mr. Cohen, I believe you said, you believe he's an 8 aggressive guy. He's a fast speaker, someone who is not the 9 easiest guy to work with if you are not familiar with him; is 10 that a fair way to describe it? 11 A I would say so, yes. 15 A That is not correct. 16 Q That's not correct; why not? 17 A No. Once this information came out and was publicized 18 in the paper, I was taken away from the relationship.

19 MR. BLANCHE: Can we show the Court, the People and 20 the witness D10, please. 21 (Displayed.) 22 MR. BLANCHE: I'm sorry. Not up at the top. Thank 23 you.

24 (Shown to just the witness, all counsel and the 25 Court.)
12 Q And, at least, as of March last year, so March of 2023, 13 Mr. Cohen was still your client, this is before you left First 14 Republic; correct?

Page 1623 1 Q So do you recall meeting -- I think you talked about 2 not with the prosecutors at this table, but with different 3 prosecutors at the Manhattan District Attorney's office on 4 March 6th of last year? 5 A Do I remember speaking to -- yes. 6 Q And if you could just take a look at the first line of 7 that, of what's marked for identification as D10.

8 A Uh-huh.

9 Q Can you see if that refreshes your recollection that 10 you told the District Attorney that, unfortunately, Mr. Cohen 11 was still your client?

12 A What was -- this is 2016. You just asked me about 13 2023.

14 Q So in 2023, when you met with the District Attorney, he 15 was not your client? 16 A In 2023 he was not -- no longer my client.

19 A 2017, at some point, once this information went 20 public. 21 Q So when you say when "this information went public," at 22 some point when something came out about, in part, the 23 transaction that you testified about on direct --
24 A That's right.

17 Q Do you remember the -- so when was he taken away? When 18 was he no longer your client?

25 Q -- you were no longer responsible for that Page 1624 1 relationship?

2 A They didn't want me to have communication with the 3 client any longer.

2 Q But is it your understanding, and I believe you 3 testified to this on Friday, that if a client has a mortgage 4 with the bank, even if the bank decides to no longer have other 5 business with him, the mortgage will often remain, correct? 6 A That is correct.

7 Q Is that true with Mr. Cohen, as far as you know?

8 A Yes.
9 Q Maybe, this is what you were just talking about.

10 Are you familiar with the term de-risk? 11 A I am not familiar with that term, no.

12 Q When a bank determines that there is something about a 13 client, or the type of accounts the client wants to have with 14 the banks, they can decide -- the bank can decide to no longer 15 do business with them, correct? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q And you testified last week, and a little bit today, 18 that there are any number of types of work or types of clients 19 that First Republic may decide they don't want to do work with, 20 right? 21 A That's correct. 22 Q It could be the client himself or herself, correct?

23 A Yes.
24 Q It could be the type of business that client is in, 25 correct?

Page 1626 1 A That's correct.

2 Q It could be the types of transactions that are coming 3 through the accounts, incoming, outgoing, depending on the 4 circumstances, correct? 5 A A hundred percent. 9 Q Is it fair to say that you testified on Friday and 10 today about the KYC documents that Mr. Cohen completed with 11 respect to two LLCs at least, right?

12 A Yes.

13 Q And isn't that KYC process designed, at least in part, 14 to identify red flags or identify what we were just talking 15 about, something about the customer or something about the 16 business or something about the account, that maybe would make 17 the bank decide they didn't want to do business?

18 A Yes, it wouldn't indicate transaction.

19 Q Say that again. 20 A It just wouldn't indicate transaction activity to be 21 referenced. 22 Q Understood.

23 Now, if we can pull up what's already in evidence as 24 People's Exhibit 368, and this can be shown to everybody. 25 This is something that you testified about on Friday, 6 Q And do you know whether that type of analysis was done 7 on Mr. Cohen between the time he started at the bank and 2016?

8 A I do not know if that analysis was done, no.

Page 1627 1 I believe.

2 This is a KYC form for Essential Consultants, correct?

3 A Yes, it is.

4 Q And you didn't complete this with Mr. Cohen, 5 Mr. Hutchins did, is that right? 6 A That's right.

7 Q And you -- what was your business relationship with 9 A He worked in one of the offices. So, at times he 10 would service my clientele. 11 Q Was there something unique between your relationship 12 with Mr. Hutchins, or did you have folks like Mr. Hutchins all 13 over?

14 A I had folks like Mr. Hutchins at all of the offices. 15 Q Is it because of his location near Trump Tower that 16 Mr. Hutchins was involved in the Michael Cohen relationship? 17 A Yes.

18 Q And if we can look at page two of this document, 19 please. There is a narrative, a business narrative, that's 20 discussed. If we can just blow that up. 21 And it says, Michael Cohen is opening Essential 22 Consultants as a real estate consulting company to collect fees 23 for investment consulting work he does in real estate deals.

24 Do you see that? 25 A Yes.

8 Mr. Hutchins?

Page 1628 1 Q Do you remember at the time having any concerns about 2 Mr. Cohen's description of this business narrative?

3 A No, it seemed consistent with what he did on his own 4 activity. 5 Q And to be clear, the work that Mr. Cohen is describing 6 as a consultant would be separate from the work he was doing, 7 for whatever he was doing, for the Trump Organization, correct?

8 A Yes.

9 Q Right. Like, President Donald Trump didn't bank with 10 First Republic, as far as you know, right? 11 A I wouldn't know. We can only see the clients we do 14 A Correct. 15 Q And Mr. Cohen, who did do business with you, never 16 told you that a deal he was doing, he was doing with Donald J. 17 Trump or the Trump Organization; that would be separate, 18 correct?

19 A Yes, it would. 20 Q Indeed, if he had said, this is a deal I am doing with 21 my employer, you may have asked questions? 22 A I would have asked questions.

23 Q And that didn't happen?

24 A That did not happen. 25 Q But you understood at the time as you testified, I
13 Q He did not do business with you?

12 business with.

Page 1629 1 believe, that Mr. Cohen did do work, real estate work at least, 2 and consulting work that was separate and apart from his job at 3 the Trump Organization, correct?

4 A That's correct. 5 Q And, by the way, your basis for knowing that is Mr. 6 Cohen, correct?

7 A Yes.

8 Q What I mean by that, you don't go out and do an 9 internal investigation of Mr. Cohen's real estate deals; he 10 tells you and you accept it, correct? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And there is nothing wrong with you doing that?

13 A I couldn't infringe upon and ask any further questions 14 on that. 15 Q I think you testified you had 1800 clients, is that 16 right, over the time? 17 A Approximately, yes.

18 Q Now, I want to focus a little bit more on 19 October 2016, which you testified about Friday and again this 20 morning. 21 You recall having several phone calls with Mr. Cohen 22 in those few weeks in October 2016?

23 A Thirteen to 26, yes.

24 Q And that's different from your relationship with him 25 the rest of the time?

Page 1630 1 A Yes.

2 Q So the initial LLC was never funded, never opened, 3 Resolution Consultants, correct?

4 A That's correct. 5 Q Do you know why? 6 A I have no idea why.

7 Q Does it matter why?

8 A It doesn't matter.

9 Q Meaning, if a client comes to you and says, I have a 10 new LLC, and I want to open an account, and they complete the 11 KYC, but, ultimately, the account never opens, that doesn't 12 alert you?

13 That doesn't raise, necessarily, a red flag, does it?

14 A It's not a red flag. 15 Q And then, as you testified today, a week or so later 16 in October of 2016, Mr. Cohen called you and said he wanted to 17 open an account.

18 Was that the day that you were golfing?

19 A Yes, it was, sir. 20 Q We are all jealous. 21 And so, but that didn't really matter because you can 22 go across the street and do everything you would have done on 23 the phone?

24 A That's correct. 25 Q And you have a team, Ms. Rappaport and you had folks Page 1631 1 there helping you make things happen?

2 A I have several team members, yes.

3 Q And, again, if we can put up Exhibit, already in 4 evidence, 371, if we can go to the second page first, and then 5 the next page. 6 This is, again, the various documentation associated 7 with the LLC that ultimately was founded, correct?

8 A That's correct.

9 Q And on page two, there are some questions about 10 whether, I believe, standard questions about whether he is 11 acting as an agent for anybody.

12 And Mr. Cohen answered, no, to that, right?

13 A That's correct.

14 Q And if he had answered, yes, that would have 15 potentially raised more questions? 16 A Well, not only would it raise more questions, it would 17 require more paperwork.

18 Q What type of paperwork?

19 A We would have to know. We would have to determine 20 exactly who he was acting as agent for. 21 Q And by, know, just have him tell you, or would there 22 have to be --
23 A No.

24 Q -- proof, documentation? 25 A Documentation.

Page 1632 1 Q So, it's not just a conversation.

2 It is, actually, collecting additional documentation 3 from Mr. Cohen and the agent?

4 A We would have to ensure that he is not working with a 5 person of interest. 6 Q And you testified on Friday about -- the prosecutors 7 asked you about what your understanding of a shell corporation 8 is. Do you remember those questions?

9 A I do.

10 Q And I believe you testified that it is an entity 11 that's opened up to receive monies and send out wires and 12 doesn't have an actual business behind it?

13 A Yes.

14 Q Correct? 15 A Yes. 16 Q You have no reason to believe, or you didn't at the 17 time, that Mr. Cohen was opening up this LLC to be a shell 18 corporation, did you?

19 A I don't open up shell corporations. I open up LLC 20 accounts that have operating businesses. And if a client had 21 told me that this would be a shell corporation, the account 22 would not have been opened.

23 Q Why is that?

24 A Because it's -- shell corporations that have no 25 business behind them would give me pause.

Page 1633 1 Very frankly, I would want to understand what the 2 purpose of simply opening an account to simply send out wires 3 would be.

13 that document or a mortgage taken against that becomes a public 14 record. 15 Q But an LLC could also be for a business, correct? 16 A They are commonly used for businesses. 17 Q So, if Mr. Cohen says he is opening a consulting 18 business or a law firm, that wouldn't raise any red flags to 19 you either? 20 A Not at all. 22 correct? 21 Q And, indeed, that's what he said he was doing, 23 A That's correct.

24 Q Did you -- so, if we can put up Exhibit 366, which is 25 already in evidence, and I would like to turn to paragraph 4 Q So, your expectation from your client is that when 5 they open an account, whether it be a LLC or otherwise, it 6 would not be a shell corporation, it would be something in 7 business?

8 A There would only be one purpose that I would open up 9 an account that had very little activity on it, and that would 10 be LLC ownership of a home or a yacht or aircraft or something 11 along those lines. And the purpose of that ownership would be 12 to remain anonymous, simply because any type of mortgage on Page 1634 1 eight, the first page, so we can see it.

2 So, you were shown this document on Friday, and then 3 if we can turn to page eight with the Bates number ending 4 94230. And then if we can just blow up the middle, please. 5 You were asked a question on Friday, and then you were 6 asked a series of questions today about the boxes that were 7 checked on forms like this, both this one, and then also the 8 one that was later completed for the other LLC.

9 And you were asked about question 12, is this entity 10 associated with political fundraising, Political Action 11 Committees, PACs, and the box is checked no, right?

12 Do you remember those questions?

13 A I do.

17 If the answer is, yes, it doesn't mean the LLC won't 18 be opened, does it?

19 A It does not. 20 Q It just means that there is going to be some sort of 21 follow-up question from you or from your Compliance Department 22 or something like that, correct?

23 A That's correct. But I do want to clarify one thing, 24 if I may. 25 Q Yes, please, sir.

14 Q So there is a series of other questions that we are 15 looking at on the screen now, all of which say, no, for each of 16 those questions, including the highlighted one.

Page 1635 1 A If the box is checked, yes, referring to, 2 Persons/Entities Found on the OFAC/SDN List, that would be a 3 hard no.

6 A Underneath 16A, to the right, you will see, on the 7 OFAC/SDN list. I would like to be concise.

8 If they were on the OFAC list, we would not open that 9 account. That would be totally non-optional.

10 Q Understood. 11 So there are some boxes that could be checked and 12 would likely be fatal to the LLC opening an account with your 13 bank?

14 A Yes. 15 Q Fair. That makes sense. 16 You were asked questions this morning about whether 17 you would have had a different reaction to the accounts if you 18 had known, or if you were told that the account was going to be 19 used for some sort of political activity or political 20 fundraising, correct? 21 A Correct. 22 Q You weren't told that, were you?

23 A No, I was not.

24 Q As far as you knew, at the time from your 25 communications with your team that were communicating with Mr.

4 Q Can you -- can you just indicate what you are 5 referring to, sir?

Page 1636 1 Cohen, and from Mr. Cohen himself, that wasn't the purpose of 2 this LLC?

3 A That's not what he told me or my team.

4 Q Do you recall -- I want to move forward a little bit 5 to 2017. 6 A Okay.

7 Q Do you recall on March 2, 2017, that you emailed Mr.

8 Cohen at his Trump Organization email address and received a 9 bounce-back saying, as of January 20th, Mr. Cohen had accepted 10 the role as personal counsel to President Donald J. Trump? Do 11 you recall that?

12 A I do recall that, yes.

13 Q Was that email bounce-back on March 17, 2017, the 14 first time you learned that Mr. Cohen had left the Trump 15 Organization to be President Trump's personal lawyer? 16 A No, it, actually, was sent errantly. 17 Q Say that again.

18 A That email was sent errantly.

19 Q Putting aside the reason for why the email was sent, 20 my question to you was, when you received the bounce back, was 21 that the first time you learned that Mr. Cohen had left the 22 Trump Organization?

23 A Oh, yes, sir.

24 Q So, up until -- so between -- well, up until 25 March 21st of 2017, you didn't know anything about whether Page 1637 1 Mr. Cohen was still at the Trump Organization or where he was 2 working?

3 A No.

4 Q And then, do you recall a series of communications and 5 emails a little bit later in 2017, in March and April, when a 6 new account was being opened for Mr. Cohen's new law firm?

7 A I do not recall that.

8 Q If we can just show, and not to the jury, but just to 9 the witness, the Court and the People and us, D13.

10 A Okay. 11 Q If you can take a look at D13, and take your time. It 12 is a couple --
13 A This refreshes my memory.

14 Q So, does that refresh your recollection that around 15 the same time as that errant email was sent -- 16 A Yes. 17 Q -- you opened an account, or you and your team, opened 18 an account for Mr. Cohen and his new law firm?

19 A Yes. 20 Q And I know your memory has just been refreshed, but do 21 you recall, now that it has been refreshed, having any concerns 22 at any time about this new account being opened by Mr. Cohen?

23 A No, he is a lawyer opening a new law firm account.

24 Q Now, are you familiar with the term PEP? 25 A Politically Exposed Person.

Page 1638 2 that term?

1 Q Yes. Can you tell the jury -- are you familiar with 3 A I am.

4 Q Can you tell the jury what a Politically Exposed 5 Person, a PEP, is? 6 A It's someone who has either held office, is in office 7 or is related to, or very close to, someone in office.

8 Q When you say, in office, are there different types of 9 PEPs, international and domestic?

10 A Yes, there is. 11 Q So, when you were just talking about someone who held 12 office, do you mean a domestic PEP is someone elected to serve 13 as a Congressman, Senator, State Senator, President of the 14 United States, that sort of thing? 15 A Yes.

18 him a PEP?

16 Q Now, as -- if Mr. Cohen is a personal attorney to 17 President Donald Trump in 2017, in your view, would that make 20 PEP. 19 A As the attorney for him, I would not consider that a 21 Q So, are you aware that the definition of a PEP, 22 domestic PEP, includes any close associates or any individual 23 publicly known or known by the financial institution to be a 24 close, personal, professional associate? 25 A I was not aware of that.

Page 1639 1 Q Now, if you had been aware, or if you had considered 2 that, what's the process, or what was the process when you were 3 working there to identify or look into whether somebody should 4 be identified as a PEP by the bank? 5 MS. MANGOLD: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Overruled.

7 You can answer.

8 A That would bring it up to the second level, BSA/AML.

9 Q So, the BSA/AML, the second layer that you testified 10 about on Friday, the Compliance Department, would presumably 11 ask questions of you or ask questions of the client?

12 A They will -- well, they would ask both. They wouldn't 13 go directly to the client. They would come through me, 14 typically. But in some cases they would speak directly to the 15 client to understand how deep of a relationship it is and if 16 that could, potentially, put us at risk in any way. 17 Q Have you, to the best of your knowledge, ever had a 18 client who was a PEP?

20 Q So what types of safeguards or traps are put around an 21 account or relationship of a PEP? 22 A The accounts are monitored pretty closely to ensure 23 that activity is not going in any way that would put us at 24 risk. 25 Q Is the monitoring -- can you explain to the jury what 19 A I have.

Page 1640 1 you mean by that?

2 A Transaction activity monitoring, limits are done on 3 all accounts, but there would be an added layer on this.

4 Q So, algorithms and whatnot that are behind the scenes, 5 and also, of course, the limits of the first line of defense as 6 well?

7 A As well as a second line of defense. We would 8 continue to monitor that account.

9 Q Do you recall an email from Mr. Cohen to you, again, 10 we are moving a little further along to September of 2017, 11 saying, on September 1st, where he said that he needed to speak 12 with you, important, asking when you are free?

13 A September 30th?

14 Q September 1, 2017? 15 A I do not. 16 Q Do you have any idea, as you sit here today, whether 17 you spoke with him on that day?

18 A I do not recall.

19 Q And you don't recall then, I assume, what any 20 conversation was about? 21 A No. 22 Q Do you recall any communications with Mr. Cohen 23 besides what you testified today about in March 2017?

24 Since March, April, 2017, do you recall any other 25 conversations with Mr. Cohen?

Page 1641 1 A No.

2 Q You testified earlier today about the HELOC and the 3 money moving into Mr. Cohen's account, opening the account and 4 it all happening pretty quickly, correct? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And I believe you testified that for real estate 7 transactions that's not necessarily unusual?

8 A It's not unusual. It's not every time, but it's not 19 account is opened, the account is funded and a wire going out. 20 My question is that, that could be the case for all 21 kinds of contractual transactions between your client and 22 another party, correct?

23 A Correct.

24 Q And the safeguards you testified about today, asking 25 the client why the wire is going to be sent, and from the 10 Q But it is not just real estate transactions, right, 11 that would also be true of other types of contracts, such as 12 purchasing a yacht which you testified?

13 A A yacht, an aircraft, for -- there are many different 14 reasons why clients came to us and why they work with us is our 15 ability to execute transactions quickly. 16 Q Correct. But I am focused more on the speed and the 17 way that this happened with Mr. Cohen where he calls you, you 18 send him to Mr. Hutchins, and literally within a day, the 9 unusual.

Page 1642 1 paperwork it looks like Mr. Cohen says, retainer?

2 A It says, retainer. It is domestic as well so that's
3 what makes it easier to do.

4 Q The location that the wire is being sent, so in this 5 case, to a law firm, correct, that would also be something that 6 you would look at?

7 A Yes, I mean, it happens a thousand times a day.

8 Q And my point is this, my point is, at the time, in 9 October 2016, nothing about the way this account was opened, 10 funded or the wire that was sent out, at the time, raised any 11 red flags to you, correct?

12 A Not based upon the answers that I was given for the 13 questions I asked.

14 Q And similarly to your team, if one of them had a red 15 flag from -- if Ms. Rappaport had a concern from her 16 communications with Mr. Cohen, she would have raised that to 17 you?

18 A That would have been brought to my attention and the 19 process would have been delayed. 20 Q And that did not happen? 21 A That did not happen. 22 MR. BLANCHE: Can I just have one moment, your 23 Honor?

24 (Whereupon, defense counsel confer.) 25 Page 1643 1 BY MR. BLANCHE:
2 Q And I think we talked a little bit about this earlier, 3 about Mr. Cohen's relationship working for the Trump 4 Organization and his relationship with you. 5 You never had any communications with him about Donald 6 Trump himself, did you?

7 A I did not.

8 Q And you have never spoken with Donald Trump yourself, 9 have you?

10 A I have not. 11 MR. BLANCHE: No more questions, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Any redirect?

13 MS. MANGOLD: Just a little bit, your Honor.

14 REDIRECT EXAMINATION 15 BY MS. MANGOLD: 16 Q Now, Mr. Farro, you just testified that at a certain 17 point the bank took away the client relationship from you and 18 that Mr. Cohen's accounts were largely closed at First Republic 19 Bank, is that correct? 20 A The accounts that we could close were closed, yes. 21 Q Can you describe the circumstances of that to the 22 jury?

23 A Yes, when -- we have the optionality to close the 24 account at any time we chose not to be attached to what we 25 consider to be negative press. When we saw negative press, we Page 1644

1 chose to close the accounts which we could, which are the 2 operational bank accounts.

3 We cannot close out a mortgage, simply because you 4 can't expect the client to pay it off in full. So, we
5 maintained the mortgage accounts and closed out the bank 6 accounts.

7 Q And what is the negative press you are referring to 9 A The Stormy Daniels, the one that came out.

10 Q And was that the first time that the bank learned the 11 true nature of those transactions that we discussed?

12 A Yes.

13 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

14 THE COURT: Overruled. 15 Q Was Mr. Cohen's accounts, other than his mortgage 16 account, closed because the bank learned of the true nature of 17 those transactions?

18 A Well, once the client does not be completely honest 19 with us, we choose not to do business with them going forward. 20 MS. MANGOLD: No further questions. 21 THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Blanche? 22 MR. BLANCHE: Just very brief.

23 RECROSS-EXAMINATION
24 BY MR. BLANCHE: 25 Q So, just to understand, were you part of the decision 8 here?

Page 1645 1 to close the accounts that could be closed with Mr. Cohen?

2 A I don't make those decisions.

3 Q No, you were not part of those decisions?

5 Q You were informed that the decision was made? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And you -- do you have any reason to believe that when 8 that decision was made, it had anything to do with anything 9 other than the public pressure reports about what you just 10 testified? 11 A That was my understanding.

12 Q And, if true -- and, by the way, you have no personal 13 knowledge of whether it is true or not, do you?

14 A No. 15 Q If true, that would have meant, potentially, that 16 there wasn't appropriate due diligence done by the bank at the 17 time, right?

18 MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

19 THE COURT: Overruled. 20 A I don't know if that's a fair statement. 21 Q Well -- 22 A Due diligence is done prior to an account being 23 opened. After a transaction happens, it goes from one lawyer 24 to another lawyer. I can't be expected to know where it is 25 going to end up after that.

4 A No.

Page 1646 1 Q Understood.

2 And the decision that was made to exit from the 3 relationship, with the exception of the mortgage, was done by, 4 is it fair to say, compliance folks at the bank? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And not by you?

7 A It was not. The decision was not mine.

8 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you.

9 No more questions.

10 THE COURT: Thank you. 11 MS. MANGOLD: Nothing further, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Thank you, sir, you can step down.

13 (Whereupon, the witness was excused.)
14 THE COURT: Jurors, let's take our morning 15 recess. Please remember to follow my instructions. 16 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 17 (Whereupon, the jury exited the courtroom.)
18 THE COURT: Thank you. Please be seated.

19 People, is there anything you need to go over? 20 MR. STEINGLASS: Is this the time that you would 21 like us to take up some of those outstanding issues? 22 THE COURT: Sure.

23 MR. STEINGLASS: Briefly, the parties did confer.

24 I am handing up to the Court -- do you need another copy of 25 this?

Page 1647

1 I am handing up to the Court some proposed 2 redactions as to Exhibit 171. The items that are circled 3 in red, those are items that we have agreed to redact 4 beyond what is already blacked out.
5 The three tabbed red items are the remaining 6 points of contention. We did reach a lot of progress on 7 this.

8 THE COURT: Thank you.

9 MR. STEINGLASS: So, would you like me to talk 10 about three? 11 THE COURT: Yes.

12 MR. STEINGLASS: So, the first item in contention 13 is on line 38909, in which Gina Rodriguez says she stopped 14 it a long time ago because he threatened to sue me. 15 Then the next one is on October 19th, and this is 16 in the midst of, you can tell from the context here, in the 17 midst of negotiations over the Stormy Daniels deal and kind 18 of delays that were perceived as happening by Michael 19 Cohen, that Ms. Rodriguez tells Dylan Howard, quote, very 20 shady shit is going on. 21 THE COURT: What line are you on? 22 MR. STEINGLASS: It's 39540. That's on page 10.

23 MR. BLANCHE: Second from the bottom.

24 THE COURT: I see it. 25 MR. STEINGLASS: And then, finally, on page 11, Page 1648 1 and this is -- both of these are within about a week of the 2 execution of the contract between Stormy Daniels and 3 Mr. Trump.

4 Yes, he is sending what she signed with Trump so 5 he can get the story out with Fox this morning and nobody 6 else would be afraid. Daily Mail is scared of Trump.

7 This is on 39551 is the line for that and is the 8 third tab.

9 So, as I believe your Honor has, and will 15 We have no problem with the limiting 16 instructions. We are not trying to argue the truth of the 17 statements contained in Ms. Rodriguez's texts, but they do 18 contextualize, A, what was going on in terms of the 19 transactions and the negotiations at the time, and also 20 Mr. Howard's responses. 21 Of all of these three, we can, and I actually 22 communicated this with Mr. Blanche, we can live without 23 number one, if they feel so strongly about it. But I do 24 think that the others are very relevant and very timely in 25 terms of that being fact, that they are happening within a 10 continue to instruct the jury, the Rodriguez portions of -- 11 Ms. Rodriguez is not alleged to be a co-conspirator in this 12 case. So, her texts are only coming in to contextualize 13 Dylan Howard's texts. And Dylan Howard clearly is a 14 co-conspirator in this case.

Page 1649 1 week or so of the transaction being finalized.

2 So those are the ones we could not agree on.

3 MR. BLANCHE: We feel very strongly about all 4 three. I think what we have done to try to appreciate your 5 Honor's ruling, there are two -- and Ms. Rodriguez is not 6 alleged to be an accomplice, and the only reason these are 7 coming in is to provide, as the People just said, context.

8 And so, with the first one, there is just no --
9 there is just no necessary reason to include that for 10 context. So, it's not being offered for the truth. 11 The very small potential, you know, benefit of it 12 providing context, in our view, is greatly outweighed by 13 the potential for the jury to have confusion and take it 14 for the wrong reason, even with a limited instruction. 15 That is the exact same reason for the other one as well. 16 If you read all the texts and with all the 17 evidence that has been permitted about what's happening in 18 that week, no context is necessary in that situation given 19 the risks that they are going to -- the jury would take, 20 very shady shit is going on, for improper reasons. 21 Who knows why she said it. We can all guess and 22 speculate, but that's why it shouldn't come in.

23 And then the last, your Honor, look, we don't 24 think it should come in at all. We certainly do not think 25 the last sentence in the clause of the first sentence Page 1650 1 should come in at the end of it.

2 So, yes, he is sending what she signed with Trump 3 so we can get the story out with Fox this morning, and then 4 no one will be afraid. And the Daily Mail is scared of 5 Trump. 6 I mean, that's a hearsay statement that provides 7 no context to the rest of the text exchange. So, that's --
8 we did agree on virtually everything. That's our very 9 strong belief that those should be excluded as well.

10 THE COURT: All right. I will rule after the 11 break.

12 Thank you.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: And just on this redaction 14 topic, we did agree on the proposed redactions to People's 15 163, which was the email involving Dino Sajudin. And so, 16 we will swap out the version that's admitted into evidence 17 with the redacted version.

18 And, finally, we agreed to withdraw People's 170, 19 which had, basically, one line that was not coming in for 20 the truth, and we agreed to remove that exhibit. So we are 21 withdrawing that exhibit. 22 THE COURT: Is it possible to pull that exhibit 23 up just on my monitor?

24 MR. STEINGLASS: We can do it. 25 THE COURT: Okay.

Page 1651 1 MR. STEINGLASS: And I believe there are two 2 additional applications that Mr. Colangelo has if you want 3 to entertain them at this time.

4 THE COURT: Sure. 5 MR. COLANGELO: First, in light of the Court's 6 order this morning, holding the defendant in criminal 7 contempt for nine willful violations of the Court's April 8 1st Order, the People wish to give supplemental Sandoval 9 notice that if the defendant testifies in this trial, the 10 People will seek to cross-examine him on those findings. 11 We are not asking to be heard further now on this 12 issue, but we would like to give notice to the Court and 13 defense counsel as soon as possible so that if the defense 14 intends to ask the Court to limit or prohibit 15 cross-examination on any those nine willful violations, the 16 Court can schedule a Sandoval hearing at the Court's 17 convenience and we will be prepared to address the 18 remaining issues.

19 THE COURT: Would you like to be heard briefly? 20 MR. BLANCHE: I haven't read the Decision yet. 21 We very much want to be heard, not right now. 22 THE COURT: Okay. You have time to read the 23 Decision.

24 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor. 25 The second matter relates to one of the Court's Page 1652 1 pretrial evidentiary rulings that the Court asked the 2 People to re-raise at an appropriate point. We think now 3 is not that point, but soon is the appropriate point.

4 This relates to the People's request to introduce 5 evidence regarding the defendant's attempt to dissuade 6 witnesses, including Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, 7 through a public pressure campaign, retaliation, harassing 8 comments, including in public remarks and online.

9 The Court originally held in its Order on the 10 People's motions in limine, reserved the item pending an 11 offer of proof. We made the offer of proof on April 15th.

12 The Court held at that time that the evidence 13 regarding the intimidation and pressure campaign was 14 probative for multiple purposes, including the defendant's 15 guilty conscious and to explain witnesses changing their 16 position, but the Court excluded that evidence subject to 17 the defense opening the door.

18 And the Court -- I believe the Court said the 19 issue might well be academic because the defense was likely 20 to open the door. 21 We believe the defense did, in fact, as your 22 Honor predicted, open the door in opening statements last 23 week, and they did so in the opening statement in several 24 ways. 25 Counsel stated that the evidence would show that Page 1653 1 Mr. Cohen was previously loyal and defended the defendant 2 on television, publicly and privately. And then, after 3 getting caught in 2018, Mr. Cohen made the decision to 4 blame the defendant for his problems, and he is an admitted 5 liar, and that's at pages 899 to 900. 6 Defense counsel also said the evidence would show 11 The defense made a similar or same assertions as 12 to Stormy Daniels, another expected witness, stating that 13 the evidence would show that she previously denied an 14 improper relationship in writing, and that she was now 15 making a living off of the defendant by talking about her 16 interactions with him, including through a book and a 17 documentary.

18 All of those assertions that defense counsel made 19 in the opening statement about what the evidence would show 20 regarding the credibility of those witnesses are precisely 21 the kinds of arguments or assertions that your Honor 22 predicted the defense would make and stated, would open the 23 door to the People being allowed to elicit evidence 24 regarding the defendant's efforts to keep them in the fold, 25 keep Mr. Cohen in the fold originally, followed by 7 that Mr. Cohen's expected testimony can't be believed 8 because his goal is to go on television and social media 9 and his entire financial livelihood depends on attacking 10 the defendant.

Page 1654 1 subsequent harassment online.

2 So we ask the Court -- I am sorry.

3 When the Court made that ruling on April 15th, 4 the Court said the People should bring this back to me if 5 at any point you believe that the defense has opened the 6 door.

14 Thank you. 15 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, at the very least, 16 there should be a proffer beyond just we are going to 17 elicit all of this information about a pressure campaign 18 and what the questions will be.

19 We certainly opened the door that we will expose 20 bias by Mr. Cohen and by other witnesses, for sure, and we 21 intend to cross-examine witnesses about their bias, 7 So we ask the Court, in light of the opening 8 statements, to hold that the People may introduce evidence 9 to offset the defense claim that these witnesses are 10 somehow benefiting from their willingness to testify to 11 explain why both witnesses initially denied certain facts 12 and now acknowledge those facts and as evidence of the 13 defendant's consciousness of guilt.

22 including their financial motivation in testifying the way 23 they are today. That's different in kind than eliciting --
24 well, depending on what the questions will be, questions 25 about a pressure campaign, because of public tweets or Page 1655 1 Truths by President Trump at the time, and presumably now.

2 So, before we -- before your Honor rules, we 7 think we will know what they are going to ask when they ask 8 it, and if there is an objection, you can make your 9 objection, unless the People would like to disclose what it 10 is. 11 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, the evidence that we 12 will offer is the evidence that Mr. Steinglass presented 13 during the offer of proof that we made to your Honor on 14 April 15th. That was -- that's recorded in the transcript 15 on April 15th, I believe, starting at page 41 and going 16 through your Honor's ruling at 58. 17 In that colloquy, the People disclosed and --
18 described broadly and disclosed half a dozen or more 19 exhibits that we intend to elicit as part of the pressure 20 campaign and the intimidation effort. We also described it 21 at length in our February 22nd motion in limine describing 22 the Molineux information that we intended to bring out.

23 So, we are happy to bring those exhibits up again 24 to the extent your Honor wishes to see them again. It's 25 the evidence and the discussion of that evidence that we 3 would ask the People to proffer what it is, specifically, 4 they intend to elicit from the witnesses or extrinsically 5 prove regarding this and go from there. 6 THE COURT: Well, if the door has been opened, I
Page 1656 1 presented on April 15th.

2 THE COURT: Could you go over that one more time, 3 the three purposes you want to elicit this?

4 MR. COLANGELO: Yes. First, is to offset the 5 defense claim that the witnesses are benefiting from their 6 willingness to testify. And by showing, to rebut that 7 claim, that, in fact, their cooperation with law 8 enforcement has harmed them more than it has helped them.

9 Your Honor will remember that in explaining the 10 allowable use of this evidence for that purpose, my 11 colleague mentioned the People versus Edwards case and 12 handed it up on April 15th to the Court.

13 The second purpose is to explain why both 14 witnesses initially denied certain facts and have now 15 acknowledged those facts. 16 And the third purpose is as evidence of the 17 defendant's consciousness of guilt.

18 And if I can just direct your Honor's attention 19 to the transcript -- to the transcript of the April 15th 20 proceeding, starting at page 56. 21 Your Honor already observed following the 22 People's proffer of that evidence, quote, you can't dispute 23 that virtually everything that you put up is probative of 24 something to some degree, whether it is consciousness of 25 guilt to explain Mr. Cohen's turnaround to offset Page 1657 1 allegations that the witness is somehow benefiting from 2 this.

3 So, your Honor recognized those purposes that the 4 People should not elicit anything until the defense opened 5 the door, and our point now is that it is clear that the 6 opening statements opened the door wide.

7 THE COURT: Can you go ahead and articulate what 8 the consciousness of guilt would be?

9 What was it about these actions that goes to 10 consciousness of guilt? 11 MR. COLANGELO: Sure.

12 So, your Honor, public statements, and the public 13 statements, in particular, that we are thinking of are 14 comments regarding Michael Cohen during early 2018, 15 immediately after the FBI raid and seizure of his devices, 16 and the raid of his homes, saying things like, some people 17 may flip if they are put under pressure, but Michael Cohen 18 is not that kind of person.

19 Followed immediately after, he plead guilty in 20 August of 2018, by other public statements that changed his 21 tune entirely. Then he said things like, if anybody is 22 looking for a good lawyer, Michael Cohen is not your 23 person. I am paraphrasing.

24 But it's in the tweets referring to Paul 25 Manafort, and saying, Paul Manafort will never crack, Page 1658 1 unlike other people who will flip if the government puts 2 them under pressure.

3 So that's evidence of a coordinated effort to 4 bolster the witness and to prevent him from cooperating by 5 saying nice things about him publicly, and as soon as he 6 began cooperating, attacking him, which is classic evidence 7 of consciousness of guilt by intimidating and attacking a 8 witness.

9 THE COURT: Go on.

10 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, consciousness of guilt 11 is much different than what the People just described.

12 Consciousness of guilt would allow the People to 13 say, how do you know that he is guilty, Ladies and 14 Gentlemen? Well, look what he did on this day which shows 15 consciousness of guilt. 16 The idea that President Trump was somehow feeling 17 guilty or consciousness of guilt about the indictment in 18 this case, when he was speaking about Michael Cohen and 19 pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York to 20 crimes that Presidents Trump isn't charged with and never 21 was charged with, doesn't work, right. 22 Meaning that there are 34 counts here of 23 falsifying business records.

24 There is -- the statements that President Trump 25 made at the time of leading up to, and at the time of Page 1659 1 Michael Cohen's guilty plea were not consciousness of guilt 2 of anything happening in this courtroom. And the risk that 3 the jury will hear that and use it for an improper purpose 4 is huge, right. 5 Is it frustrating to have your lawyer plead 6 guilty and publicly say he is going to cooperate and 7 testify against you? Of course. And similarly, statements 8 along the way encouraging his lawyer not to is not 9 surprising either.

10 Consciousness of guilt is of a different order. 11 Consciousness of guilt would be President Trump 12 doing something as it relates to the charges in this case 13 that would show his motivation for doing it was to cover 14 something up that would show that he is guilty. 15 So, with respect to the other proffered reasons 16 for some of this testimony to counter financial benefits to 17 Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels and to explain why they changed 18 their story, that makes sense. And I think they are going 19 to talk about that on direct, but consciousness of guilt is 20 of a different order, in our view. 21 THE COURT: Do you need a ruling on this? 22 MR. COLANGELO: We don't need a ruling today, but 23 understanding your Honor's view by Thursday will help us 24 plan the presentation of the rest of the case. 25 THE COURT: Thank you. See you in a few minutes.

Page 1660 1 COURT OFFICER: All rise.

2 (Whereupon, the Court exited the courtroom.)
3 (Short recess is taken.)
4 THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. 5 All parties are present. 6 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, I will ask you again, 7 let's try to keep it very short because we took a lot of 8 time deciding issues, and I don't want to keep the jury 9 waiting. Let's do better.

10 I am prepared to rule on a couple of issues 11 raised beforehand.

12 Are you ready to argue Sandoval?

13 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, can we argue that at 14 another time? 15 THE COURT: Sure. 16 With regard to the transcripts, I agree with the 17 defense that these are exchanges between a co-conspirator 18 and someone who is not a co-conspirator saying pretty 19 prejudicial things, and I don't really think they serve a 20 purpose. 21 So, I am going to rule with the defense, that 22 those must stay out.

23 Regarding the defense opening the door, I think 24 going through the words by the defense, they mostly concede 25 they opened the door. The question is as to what, what can Page 1661 1 you use that for.

2 I agree that it opened the door, and you can use
3 it to explain what I will describe as a lot of back and 4 forth amongst the main witnesses. 5 Also, you can use it to reply or explain that 6 they have not made as much money as the defense would have 7 people think.

8 At this point, I don't believe that it really 9 goes to consciousness of guilt.

10 So, I am going to deny that request. 11 They can use it for the first two reasons, not 12 for the third.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

14 Just to confirm, Judge, 171A is in. It's just 15 the three texts we talked about that have to be redacted? 16 THE COURT: That's right. 17 Thank you both for working that out. I
18 appreciate it.

19 Can we bring the jury in? 20 Let's get the jury, please. 21 (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan 22 Pearce-Bates, was relieved by Senior Court Reporter, 23 Theresa Magniccari.)
24 25 Page 1662 1 (The following proceedings are continued from 2 previous page:) 3 *** 4 THE COURT: There was one issue that was raised on 5 the break. 6 One of the jurors, I believe it was Juror Number 7 9, asked the sergeant if we were going to be working Friday 8 before Memorial Day. Apparently, she has a flight at 9 11 o'clock in the morning. That is May 24th.

10 Is there any objection from either side to not 11 working that day so that this juror can remain with us?

12 MR. STEINGLASS: No objection. 13 Mr. BlANCHE: No objection. 14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 (Jury entering courtroom.) 16 ***
17 THE CLERK: Continued case on trial, People 18 versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are 19 present.

20 THE COURT: Before we call the next witness, I did 21 want to go over two scheduling matters.

22 I was informed by the sergeant that one of the

23 jurors was asking whether we're going to work on the Friday 24 before Memorial Day. Apparently, that juror has travel 25 plans and they have a flight at 11. I was intending to
Page 1663 1 work that day. Given that one of the jurors is not able to 2 join us, we will go ahead and take that day off. That is 3 May 24th.

4 We will also not be working on May 17th. 5 May 17th and May 24th. 6 Thank you.

7 Please call your next witness.

8 MS. MANGOLD: The People call Dr. Robert Browning.

11 COURT OFFICER: Remain standing. Raise your right 12 hand.

13 THE CLERK: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that 14 the testimony that you are going to give before this Court 15 and jury shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 16 but the truth, do you so swear or affirm? 17 THE WITNESS: I do.

18 THE CLERK: Have a seat.

19 D.R. R-O-B-E-R-T B-R-O-W-N-I-N-G, called as a witness on 20 behalf of the People, was duly sworn by the Clerk of the Court, 21 upon being examined, testified as follows: 22 COURT OFFICER: Pull your chair all the way up.

2 THE WITNESS: Thibodaux County, Louisiana.

3 THE COURT: Good morning, Doctor.

4 You may inquire. 5 DIRECT EXAMINATION 6 BY MS. MANGOLD:
7 Q. Good morning, Dr. Browning.

8 I am going to ask you to speak slowly into the 9 microphone in front of you so the Court Reporter can take down 10 what you are saying. 11 Can you tell everyone where you work?

12 A. I work for C-Span.

13 Q. What is your position at C-Span?

14 A. Executive Director of the C-Span Archives. 15 Q. How long have you held that position? 16 A. Thirty-seven years. 17 Q. Have you ever testified in a legal proceeding before?

18 A. No, I have not.

19 Q. Are you nervous? 20 A. A little bit. 21 Q. We can take it slowly. If you need me to repeat a 22 question, I am happy to do that.

23 Do you understand that you are testifying today solely 24 as a custodian of records for C-Span? 25 A. Yes, I do.

Page 1665 1 Q. Did you travel from Louisiana for the purpose of 2 testifying today?

3 A. Yes. Yes, I did.

4 Q. Is C-Span testifying at this trial voluntarily or was 5 C-Span compelled to testify because it received a subpoena? 6 A. C-Span was compelled to testify with a subpoena.

7 Q. Is C-Span represented by counsel?

8 A. Yes.

2 Q. Does that include Donald Trump?

3 A. Yes, it does.

4 Q. As part of its business, does C-Span air political 5 events on TV? 6 A. Yes, it does.

7 Q. How does C-Span get the video footage for the events 8 that it airs?

3 A. Yes, because C-Span wants the entire event.

4 Q. How does C-Span ensure that the video that it is 5 getting is the correct video? 6 A. Once the event is taking place, there is a producer who 7 watches the video from the beginning to the end and makes sure 8 there are no interruptions in the transmission.

9 Q. Does a producer watching the video come in whether or 10 not the video is being aired live on C-Span? 11 A. That is true.

12 Q. Is the video camera equipment tested before an event?

Page 1668 1 A. Yes, in the video library, the C-Span archives.

3 THE COURT: Good morning.

4 You may inquire. 5 DIRECT EXAMINATION 6 BY MS. MANGOLD:
7 Q. Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

8 A. Good morning.

9 Q. Can you tell the jury where you work?

10 A. I work for Esquire Deposition Solutions. 11 Q. What kind of company is Esquire Deposition Solutions?

12 A. We are a national court reporting company that hires 13 court reporters, videographers and interpreters.

14 Q. How long have you worked there? 15 A. This is my eighth year. 16 Q. What is your current position? 17 A. My title is Regional Director of Field Operations for 18 the South.

19 Q. And I am going to ask you to speak a little closer to 20 the microphone so everyone can hear what you are saying. 21 Are you familiar with something called TSG Reporting? 22 A. I am. TSG was a court reporting firm that we acquired 23 in May of '22.

24 Q. In October of '22, was TSG a division of Esquire? 25 A. Yes, they were.

Page 1674 1 Q. Did TSG have its own processes and procedures at that 2 time?

3 A. Yes, they did.

4 Q. As a Regional Director at Esquire, are you familiar 5 with the recordkeeping practices of Esquire and its divisions 7 A. Yes, I am.

8 Q. Do you understand that you're testifying today as a 9 custodian of records for Esquire Deposition Solutions?

10 A. I do. 11 Q. Did you come from Texas for the purpose of testifying 12 today?

13 A. I did.

14 Q. Is Esquire Deposition Solutions testifying voluntarily 15 or in response to a subpoena? 16 A. In response to a subpoena. 17 Q. Does Esquire Deposition Solutions have counsel?

18 A. We do.

19 Q. Is counsel present in the courtroom today? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. All right. For the folks who may not know, what is a 22 deposition?

23 A. A deposition is a method to capture sworn testimony, 24 typically in the discovery period of a civil suit. 25 Q. When you say "the discovery period in a civil suit,"
6 including TSG?

Page 1675 1 can you explain a little bit more what that is?

2 A. Sure.

3 So the discovery process, it helps gather information 4 when a lawsuit is filed. 5 A deposition is the process of getting sworn testimony 6 before typically going into court.

7 Q. That's sworn testimony from a witness?

8 A. It is.

9 Q. And what do you mean by "sworn testimony?"
10 A. The witness is testifying under oath. 11 Q. Is a deposition recorded?

12 A. It is.

13 Q. Is it recorded sometimes in multiple ways?

14 A. Yes, ma'am. 15 Q. And what are those ways? 16 A. It is taken down by a court reporter, who is taking 17 down shorthand with the stenography machine.

18 And then it's also taken by a videographer, so they are 19 recording it live. 20 Q. And with respect to court reporters, is that similar to 21 what the court reporters here are doing, taking down testimony 22 in realtime?

23 A. Yes, ma'am.

24 Q. Is it still called a court reporter even if they're not 25 sitting in a courtroom?

Page 1676 1 A. It is.

2 Q. And is it the court reporter's job to accurately 3 transcribe the witness' testimony?

4 A. Yes. 5 Q. What type of document is produced after the deposition 6 is over?

7 A. A deposition transcript.

8 Q. Is a deposition transcript a record of everything that 9 the witness said during their sworn testimony?

10 A. Yes, it is. 11 Q. Are deposition transcripts ever certified?

12 A. Yes, they are.

13 Q. And what does that mean?

14 A. The transcript is certified from the court reporter to 15 be a verbatim copy of the deposition that was conducted that 16 day. 17 Q. I think you mentioned that a deposition may also be 18 recorded by a videographer; is that right?

19 A. Yes, ma'am. 20 Q. What does the deposition videographer do? 21 A. They are there to record and capture the deposition of 22 the video and audio.

23 Q. And that video is recorded while the deposition is 24 taking place? 25 A. Yes, it is.

Page 1677 1 Q. Is the videographer's job to accurately record the 2 witness' testimony?

3 A. It is, yes.

4 Q. Are video depositions also certified? 5 A. No. 6 Q. Just the transcripts?

7 A. Just the transcript.

8 Q. Now, directing you specifically to TGS Reporting's 9 recordkeeping practices in October 2022, I think you said TSG
10 was a division of Esquire at that time? 11 A. That is correct.

12 Q. It had its own policies and practices?

13 A. That is correct.

14 Q. So for transcripts, after a deposition, did a court 15 reporter send the transcript directly to the lawyers that were 17 A. No.

18 Q. Where did they send them?

19 A. The court reporter would have sent it into TSG to do 20 the production and send it out to all parties. 21 Q. Did TSG then save those transcripts? 22 A. They did.

23 Q. How were they saved?

25 file account. 24 A. The transcripts would have been saved in their share 16 present in the deposition?

Page 1678 2 know?

1 Q. What is a share file account in case people don't 3 A. It's similar -- it's more popularly known as dropbox 4 or Box.com. It is a secure way to store large or voluminous 5 files. 6 Q. In what ways was it secured?

7 A. The share file is encrypted, to my knowledge. I don't 8 know how they encrypt it, but I do know it's encrypted.

9 Q. Is it also password protected?

10 A. It is. 11 Q. How about the videos produced by TSG in October 2022?

12 A. Yes, the videos.

13 Q. Were they transmitted also to TSG after each 14 deposition? 15 A. Yes, they would have been sent to TSG's share file 16 account as well.

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. And the company took the same steps to make sure the 20 videos were unaltered, including encryption and password 21 protection? 22 A. That is correct.

23 Q. Does a witness have an opportunity to comment on any 24 errors they think are in the transcript after it's done? 25 A. They do.

17 Q. They were saved in that share file?

Page 1679 1 Q. Do you know what that is called?

2 A. It's called the errata process.

3 Q. And did TSG keep a record of any corrections by a 4 witness to a deposition? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Does Esquire and TSG -- as part of Esquire, do they 7 make and keep deposition transcripts and videos in the regular 8 course of business?

9 A. Yes, we do.

10 Q. Was it the regular course of business for Esquire and 11 TSG to keep deposition transcripts and videos?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Were the transcripts and videos made at the time of 14 each deposition? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Did the court reporters and videographers have a 17 business duty to record each deposition accurately?

18 A. Yes, they did.

19 Q. At some point, did Esquire receive a subpoena from the 20 Manhattan District Attorney's office related to this case? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Are you familiar with Esquire's response to that 23 subpoena?

24 A. I am. 25 Q. Did the subpoena require the company to turn over a Page 1680

1 video recording and transcript from an October 2022 deposition 2 of Donald Trump in a case captioned "E. Jean Carroll versus
3 Donald Trump," with the Case Number 20CV7311?

4 A. Yes. 6 that video transcript?

7 A. Yes, we did.

8 Q. Was the deposition transcript in that case certified?

9 A. It was.

10 Q. Did Esquire produce more than one version of the 11 transcript?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Is the substance of Mr. Trump's testimony identical in 14 every version of the transcript produced? 15 A. To my knowledge, yes. 16 Q. Is it unusual to have more than one version of the 17 deposition transcript?

18 A. No.

19 Q. Did Esquire have a record of the witness admitting any 20 connections to that transcript? 21 A. We do not have a record of that. 22 Q.

13 Q. Do you remember how you came to meet her or be 14 introduced to her? 15 A. I met her probably 25 years ago, she was dating a 16 friend of mine. 17 Q. Okay. And in the summer of 2016, did you represent 18 her?

19 A. Yes. 20 Q. In what capacity? 21 A. I represented her in order to provide advice and 22 counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding 23 a personal interaction she had.

24 Q. With whom? 25 A. With Donald Trump.

Page 1702 1 Q. And do you know, approximately, when it was that she 2 became your client?

3 A. Not offhand.

4 Q. And do you know how it was that she became your client? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Can you tell us, please?

7 A. Her former brother-in-law was a client of mine and her 8 former brother-in-law, by the name of Jay Grdina, made the 9 introduction or the re-introduction between Karen and I.

10 (Displayed.) 11 Q. So I am now showing you People's 279 in evidence.

12 It's in evidence. It can be displayed to everyone.

13 I am going to ask you when it pops up, if you recognize 15 A. I do. 16 Q. What is it? 17 A. This is an email from me to Karen McDougal with the 18 cc to Jay Grdina thanking her for the conversation of that day, 19 6/15/2016. 20 Q. And does the email also contain an attachment? 21 A. It does, yes. The attachment is a retainer agreement 22 between me and my law firm and Karen.

23 Q. Is it fair to say you are sending her a blank retainer 24 agreement? 25 A. I am sending her a signature ready retainer agreement 14 this document?

Page 1703 1 for her signature.

2 Q. Got it.

3 When I say "blank," I mean her signature line was 4 blank, you were sending it to her for that purpose; is that 5 right? 6 A. For execution.

7 Q. Got it.

8 I believe you told us the date of the email was 9 June 15, 2016?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. So I want to show you Page 2 of this exhibit. Is this 12 the first page of your retainer agreement?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. I am going to ask that we blow up Paragraph 2. I am 15 going to ask you to read that for us. 16 A. Paragraph 2: Scope of Services: 17 Client is hiring attorney to represent client in the 18 matter of client's claims against Donald Trump, and/or assisting 19 client in negotiating a confidential agreement and other live 20 rights related to actions with Donald Trump, and/or negotiating 21 an assignment with exclusive press opportunities regarding the 22 same.

23 Q. Can you translate that for us?

24 A. I was to provide legal services to Karen McDougal and 25 provide advice and counsel to her surrounding a personal Page 1704 1 interaction she had allegedly had with Donald Trump.

Page 1705 1 Q And is one of the ways in which -- withdrawn.

2 This paragraph is entitled Scope of Services; correct?

3 A Yes.

4 Q Does one of the contemplated services include, 5 potentially, negotiating the assignment of exclusive press 6 opportunities regarding her interaction with Mr. Trump?

7 A That's true.

8 Q What does that mean, "negotiating the assignment of 9 exclusive press opportunities"?

10 A (Pause) At that time, in mid-Two-Thousand-Teens or so, 11 media outlets, both traditional and tabloid, would, often 12 times, enter into exclusive arrangements where someone would 13 provide an exclusive content to that media outlet in exchange 14 for money. 15 Q And did you -- you wrote this Retainer Agreement; 16 correct? 17 A I believe so.

18 Q And did you contemplate -- withdrawn.

19 Did you discuss with Ms. McDougal the fact that you were 20 authorized to negotiate on her behalf in dealing with various 21 media outlets? 22 A I can't and won't discuss what I discussed with 23 Ms. McDougal.

24 I think that the paragraph speaks for itself. 25 Q Okay.

Page 1706 1 Thank you for pointing that out.

2 So, let me ask the question a different way.

3 Did this Agreement -- did you interpret this Agreement as 4 authorizing you to interact and negotiate with media companies 5 on your client's behalf? 6 A Yes.

7 Q Thank you.

8 So, directing your attention to June of 2016, did there 9 come a time when you reached out to Dylan Howard regarding the 10 potential Karen McDougal story? 11 A Yes.

12 Q Did you do this behind your client's back?

13 A No.

14 Q Did you reveal client confidences when you spoke with 15 Mr. Howard? 16 A No. 17 Q I'm going to show you what is already in evidence and 18 can be displayed to everyone as People's Exhibit 176A.

19 (Whereupon, People's Exhibits are shown on the 21 Q I'm going to ask you if you recognize this series of 22 messages to be texts between yourself and Dylan Howard from the 23 year 2016?

24 A I do. 25 Q Have you had a chance to review the substance of these 20 screens throughout the following testimony:)
Page 1707 1 texts?

2 A I have.

3 Q And are the texts that appear on this exhibit the 4 exact texts you sent and received to and from Dylan Howard? 5 A They are. 6 Q Do you have any reason to doubt the accuracy of the 7 date and timestamps?

8 A I do not.

9 Q Okay.

10 MR. STEINGLASS: I am going to ask that we blow 11 up the last two text boxes -- I mean, the last -- the last 12 column, the first two boxes in the last column. Lines 111 13 through 112.

14 Q Let me ask you, first, can you tell what time zone 15 these -- the date and timestamp is in? 16 A I think it's UTC. 17 Q Are you familiar with the relationship between UTC
18 time and, let's say, West Coast Time or East Coast Time?

19 A Not particularly. 20 Q But these texts are dated particularly in UTC Time; is 21 that right? 22 A Yes.

23 Q What is the date on this first text?

24 A June 7th. 25 Q And who is the first text in this chain from?

Page 1708 1 A It's from me.

2 Q To whom?

3 A Dylan Howard.

4 Q What is the body of the text? 5 A I have a blockbuster Trump story. 6 Q What did you mean by that?

7 A Sort of an entree or teaser to Dylan to let him know 8 that I had, perhaps, an opportunity for him.

9 Q And what was the -- generally speaking, and certainly 10 without revealing client confidences, what was the opportunity 11 about which you were contacting him?

12 A Regarding the interaction between Karen McDougal and 13 Donald Trump.

14 Q What did Mr. Howard say, if anything, in response? 15 A "Talk 1st thing. I will get you more than anyone for 16 it. You know why." 17 Q What do you understand "Talk 1st thing" to mean?

18 A That he would call me in the morning.

19 Q What did you understand the rest of the text to mean? 20 A That -- I don't know if I had a clear understanding at 21 that time, but I knew that Dylan's boss, David Pecker, and 22 Mr. Trump were long-time friends and had a former business 23 relationship, that Mr. Pecker published Trump Magazine, and 24 that at the time AMI had announced -- they hadn't announced 25 explicitly, at least impliedly, that they had endorsed Page 1709 1 Mr. Trump's candidacy.

2 Q So, Mr. Howard said, "Talk 1st thing."
3 Did you, in fact, speak with Mr. Howard the following 4 morning? 5 A I can't recall. 6 Q Well, did you continue to text back and forth with him 7 about the Karen McDougal story?

8 A Yes.

9 Q During the course of those text messages, were there 10 also times when you spoke with him on the phone? 11 A Yes.

12 Q So, I want to display some more texts from this 13 exhibit, also still on Page 1 -- I'm just going to ask you to 14 tell us who says what here. 15 A You would like me to read these texts? 16 Q Please. 17 And tell us who each one is from as you're doing that.

19 Q Who did you understand "he" to be referring to? 20 A Donald Trump. 21 Q Okay. 22 Next text. From whom?

23 A From Dylan.

24 Q Okay. 25 A "Do you know if the affair was during his marriage to 18 A From Dylan: "Did he cheat on Melania?"
Page 1710 1 Melania?"
2 Q Again, do you understand "his" to be a reference to 3 Donald Trump?

4 A Yes. 5 Q And how did you respond to this text? 6 A "I really cannot say yet. Sorry."
7 Q Is that because you didn't know or because you weren't 8 prepared to discuss the details at that point?

9 A It was because it was the latter, because I was not 10 prepared to discuss the details at that point. 11 Q And how did Mr. Howard respond?

12 A "Okay. Keep me informed."
13 Q Now, in connection with your representation of Karen 14 McDougal, did you arrange a meeting between Karen McDougal and 15 Dylan Howard? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And were others present as well for that meeting?

18 A Yes.

19 Q Who was present for that meeting? 20 A Jay Grdina was present, and a man by the name of 21 Johnny Crawford was present, and Ms. McDougal. 22 Q Who is John Crawford?

23 A He was a friend of Karen's. I think a former police 24 officer in Phoenix, Arizona. 25 Q Where did this meeting take place?

Page 1711 1 A In my office.

2 Q Do you remember the date that the meeting took place?

3 A Not offhand.

4 Q Were you present for the meeting? 5 A I was. 6 Q Okay.

7 Let's see if some more texts in this chain can help refresh 8 your recollection.

9 MR. STEINGLASS: Switch to Page 2, Line 11 --
10 11140. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Do you see this text here?

13 A Yes.

14 Q And can you tell what date that was sent on? 15 A June 20, 2016. 16 Q What is the substance of the text? 17 A This is from Dylan Howard: "Landed. En route to your 18 office."
19 Q So, does that refresh your recollection about what 20 date the meeting took place between yourself, Dylan Howard, 21 Karen McDougal and her friend? 22 A Yes.

23 Q What was discussed during this meeting?

24 A The subject of the Retention Agreement between Karen 25 and I. The personal attraction that Karen had with Donald Page 1712 1 Trump.

2 Q Given the presence of others at this meeting, do you 3 believe that the contents of what Ms. McDougal said was 4 privileged? 5 A No. 6 Q So, can you tell us the substance of what Ms. McDougal 7 said about the nature of her interactions with Mr. Trump during 8 this meeting?

9 A I can summarize it.

10 Q That's fine. 11 A Ms. McDougal alleged that she had had a -- a romantic 12 affair with Donald Trump some years prior.

13 Q And -- withdrawn.

14 When you say "romantic", does that include sexual? 15 A That's what she expressed. 16 Q And do you know how long that romantic and sexual 17 affair lasted -- withdrawn.

18 As a result of what Ms. McDougal said in that meeting, 19 which was non-privileged, do you know how long that affair 21 A I can't recall, specifically. 22 It was several weeks to months, if not more.

23 I can't recall, specifically.

24 Q Okay. 25 Now, generally speaking, Mr. Davidson, what was the purpose 20 lasted for or how long she said it lasted for?

Page 1713 1 of this meeting between your client and Dylan Howard?

2 A It was sort of a proffer session where -- where 3 Ms. McDougal would -- under agreement that nothing was to be 4 published, where Ms. McDougal would tell her story to Dylan
5 Howard on behalf of AMI, so that Dylan could gauge interest in 6 the story, whether or not AMI did or did not have interest in 7 this story.

8 Q Now, did the meeting result in an immediate deal with 9 AMI?

10 A No, it did not. 11 Q How did you leave it with Dylan Howard?

12 A Um, Dylan wanted to -- to return to New York, um, run 13 it up the flagpole, and stated that he would get back to me.

14 Q When you say "run it up the flagpole", who, to your 15 knowledge, was higher at AMI, higher than Dylan Howard? 16 A It's my understanding that the only one higher than 17 Dylan Howard at AMI was David Pecker.

18 Q So, very generally speaking, in the weeks that 19 followed, what happened after that? 20 A I think Dylan -- the first entree, if you will, was 21 that Dylan stated that AMI was not interested at that time 22 because Karen lacked -- excuse me -- Karen, Karen McDougal 23 lacked documentary evidence of the interaction.

24 Q So, how did you leave it? 25 A Um, I think we just said we would keep in touch.

Page 1714 1 Q Okay.

2 So, let me show you some more of these texts, and I'll blow 3 up Page 4, Lines 11116 and 67.

4 (Whereupon, further exhibits are shown on the 5 screens throughout the following testimony:) 6 Q I'm going to ask you again to read us these texts and 7 tell us who sent them.

8 A This is June 27th, from me to Dylan Howard.

9 "It's a story" -- misspelling, but -- "a story that should 10 be told." 11 Q Just to clarify for the record, the body of the text 12 actually says: "It's a story hat should be told."
13 You're saying that's a typo, and it should be, "It's a 14 story that should be told"? 15 A Yes. Correct. 16 Q How -- withdrawn. 17 What "story" were you referring to?

18 A The interaction between Ms. McDougal and Mr. Trump.

19 Q How did Dylan Howard respond? 20 A "I agree." 21 Q Now, moving to some later texts on this page, we'll 22 blow them up, Lines 11227 through 31.

23 I'll ask you, first of all, what is the date of this 24 particular exchange? 25 A June 21st.

Page 1715 1 Q You sure about that month?

2 A July. July 21st.

3 Q So, it had been some time at this point?

4 A That's right. 5 Q What -- who sent what and when? 6 A This is from Dylan Howard: "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross 7 tomorrow. I think this is the entree for me to go back to 8 them."
12 Were you in phone communication with Dylan Howard, as well, 13 during this time?

14 A Yes. 15 Q And so, when -- first of all, I'm going to ask you, 16 what did you understand it to mean when Dylan Howard wrote, 17 "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross tomorrow"?

18 Who's "DT"? What's "DT"?

19 A My understanding was it was Donald Trump. 20 Q What's "Ross"?

24 Q Is it fair to say, during this period of time, you 25 were also negotiating with ABC News on Karen McDougal's behalf?

21 A "Ross" was a man named Brian Ross. I think he was a 22 broadcaster, a news broadcaster; and I think he was, at the 23 time, heavily investigating for reporting for ABC News.

9 Q To reiterate, Mr. Davidson, during this period, the --
10 more than a month had passed since your June 20th meeting with 11 Dylan Howard, and your client, and the others in your offices.

Page 1716 1 A That's true.

2 Q Had they expressed interest in acquiring Karen 3 McDougal's story?

4 A Yes. 5 Q When Dylan Howard wrote: "I think this is the entree 6 for me to go back to them," who did you understand Dylan Howard 7 would be going back to?

8 A Certainly, David Pecker.

9 I don't know if I had an understanding, or if I read the 10 text that closely, that there was anyone other than Pecker at 11 the time.

12 Q That's fine.

13 How did you respond to that?

14 A "Better be quick." 15 Q What did you mean by that? 16 A At the time, as is often the case with negotiations, I 17 was trying to play two entities off of each other.

18 Q And what's the -- what's the objective?

19 A To create a sense of urgency, if you will. 20 Q And -- withdrawn. 21 Is there anything wrong with that? 22 A No.

23 Q Can you explain why not?

25 Q Yeah. I'm not sure I do, either. 24 A I don't understand your question.

Page 1717 1 You've been a lawyer for how long?

2 A Twenty-four years.

3 Q Is there anything wrong with a lawyer negotiating on 4 behalf of their client to get the best possible deal for their 5 client? 6 A I think that's our duty.

7 Q And did you view it as your duty to try to get the 8 best deal you could for your client at the time?

9 A Yes.

10 Q Whether that deal was from AMI or from ABC or from 11 somewhere else?

12 A Correct.

13 Q So, do I understand you correctly to be saying that 14 when you said, "Better be quick," you were trying to convey 15 that there was some urgency and that Dylan Howard should act 16 quickly? 17 A That's fair.

18 Q Okay.

19 Keep going, please. 20 A This is from me to Dylan Howard: "Will do." 22 A "I know.

23 Q Did he say anything else?

24 A "I emailed and said we need to talk urgently." 25 Q What do you understand that to mean? Who had Dylan 21 Q What did Dylan Howard say?

Page 1718 1 Howard emailed?

2 A Perhaps, David Pecker.

3 Q Okay.

4 So, directing your attention to the last blown-up line on 5 Page 4, is this another exchange between you and Dylan Howard? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And who wrote this?

8 A This is from Dylan Howard -- no.

9 This is from me.

10 Q On what day? 11 A July 22nd.

12 Q And what's the body of the email or -- sorry -- the 13 body of the text?

14 A "Don't forget about Cohen. Time is of the essence. The 15 girl is being cornered" -- this is -- "the girl is being 16 cornered by the estrogen mafia." 17 Q So, who is "Cohen" in this email?

18 A Michael Cohen.

19 Q And what did you mean by "time is of the essence"? The 20 same as the "better be quick" email or text from earlier? 21 A Yeah. 22 I think, at the time, Karen was sort of teetering. She was 23 about to enter into a deal with ABC.

24 Q And what did you mean by "The girl is being cornered 25 by the estrogen mafia"?

Page 1719 1 A It's a very unfortunate, regrettable text I sent. That 2 phrase is -- is not one that I used or came up with.

3 That -- that term, I think, by one of -- one of Karen's --
4 (witness clears throat) -- associates that was at that first 5 meeting. There was several women who were, um, leaning on Karen 6 to sign the deal with ABC.

7 Q So, taken as a whole, is this text another effort to 8 spur Dylan Howard into action?

9 A Yes.

10 Q Okay. 11 So, turning to Page 5 of the exhibit, and directing your 12 attention to some of the lines between 250 and 273.

13 I'm going to ask you, first, what day is this exchange?

14 A July 22nd. 15 Q So, same day as the last text? 16 A Yes. 17 Q So, how did Dylan Howard answer your text?

18 A "Yep. I plugged a call in." We [sic] "will have news 19 by Monday." 20 Q What did you understand that to mean? 21 A That they would have an offer for Karen on Monday. 22 Q The following day, July 23rd, do you see another 23 communication from Dylan Howard?

24 A Yes. 25 Q What does that text say?

Page 1720 1 A He says: "Get me a price on McDougal. All in.

2 Consulting gig perhaps as a fitness expert thrown into the 3 mix."
4 Q What did you understand that to mean from Dylan 5 Howard? 6 A Karen had expressed at that initial meeting that she 7 had three goals that she wanted to accomplish.

8 And I think he was trying to address each of those goals in 9 order to persuade her that AMI was the right avenue for her to 10 use. 11 Q What were the three goals?

12 A To rejuvenate her career, one.

13 To -- to make money, two.

14 And, three, um, to avoid telling a story and being termed 15 "the scarlet letter", becoming "the scarlet letter"; the, 16 quote, "other woman". 17 Q So, if possible, Ms. McDougal did not want to have to 18 tell her story?

19 A She did not want to tell her story. 20 Q Now, the ABC deal that you were also working on on her 21 behalf, would that have required her to tell her story? 22 A Yes.

23 Q I'm not going to ask you about client confidences, so 24 I'll just ask you this: Is it your understanding that one of 25 the more attractive aspects of the AMI deal was that she might Page 1721 1 not actually have to tell that story, or she wouldn't have to 2 tell her story?

3 A Well, that was one of her stated goals, and that would 4 be in alignment with one of her very important stated goals. 5 Q So, Mr. Howard says: "Get me a price. All in," 6 et cetera.

7 How do you respond?

8 A It's a negotiation, and so I started high and threw 9 out a million dollars.

10 I said: "How about one million now and 75,000 a year for 11 the next two years as a fitness correspondent for AMI and your 12 related publications?"
13 Q So, you -- you almost translated that text a little 14 bit as you read it; right? 15 The number "1M" you read as "one million"; is that correct? 16 A Would you like me to read it? 17 Q That's fine.

18 A "1M" is one million, yes.

19 Q And "75K" is "75,000"? 20 A Yes. 21 Q I know this sounds silly, but "ur" is shorthand for 22 the words "you are"?

23 A Yes.

24 Q And "pubs" is short for "publications"? 25 A Yes.

Page 1722 1 Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

2 A "I'll take it to them but thinking it's more hundreds 3 than millions."
4 Q What did you understand that to mean? 5 A That was -- I should expect a counteroffer that was 6 substantially less than a million.

7 Q Okay.

8 And how did you respond to that?

9 A "800,000 now and 100,000 per year for two years for a 10 total of one million." 11 Q Again, just to make a clear record -- I'm sorry I have 12 to do that each time.

13 "800" means "800,000"; "100" means "100,000"; and "1M"
14 means "one million"? 15 A Yes. 16 Q How did Mr. Howard respond? 17 A "Leave with me."
18 Q How did you take that?

19 A That we really weren't in the same ballpark. 20 Q Okay. 21 So, next page. Lines 280 through 282; 22 I'll ask you to, first, tell us what is the date that that 23 exchange takes place on.

24 A July 28th. 25 Q Okay.

Page 1723 1 And what do the texts say?

2 Start with the first one you sent back.

3 A This is from Dylan: "We are going to lay it on thick 4 for her." 5 Q What did you understand that to mean? 6 A I think at this point in time, Karen was teetering 7 between two competing deals, and we had requested a meeting 8 where -- where each entity could make a pitch as to why they 9 were the correct avenue for Karen.

10 Q Okay. 11 And how did you respond to that?

12 A "Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking 13 the Isle of Mann."
14 Q What did you mean by that, Mr. Davidson? 15 A It was sort of in jest. But, it was -- it was just a 16 joke. 17 Q Um, so, what -- I'm trying to think about how to 18 phrase this question.

19 Why was that a joke? Why was that funny? What was going on 20 in your mind when you made that joke? 21 A Well, I don't think -- I don't think -- I don't even 22 think the Isle of Mann is a country.

23 MR. STEINGLASS: (Laughs).

24 A And I know they don't have an ambassador. 25 But, I think it was a reference to Mr. Trump's candidacy.

Page 1724 1 Q Can you just explain that a little bit more?

2 A That, somehow, if Karen did this deal with AMI, that 3 it would help Donald Trump's candidacy.

4 Q And at the time that you sent that text in jest, did 5 you understand that AMI was working with then-candidate Trump 6 regarding your client?

7 A I don't know about that. I don't know that I had 8 specific information that they were or not working with him.

9 I knew that they had announced their support for Mr. Trump, 10 but I don't know that they were working with him. 11 Q Okay. 15 A Yes. 16 Q So, I want to turn your attention to Page 6, the next 17 few lines, 292 to 293.

20 Q Yes. I'm sorry. July 28th. That's right. 21 Go ahead. 22 A This was from Dylan Howard: "She'll get more out of a 23 deal with AMI than ABC. And I'm happy to sign some sort of 24 agreement that alleviates some fears about jurisdiction/meeting 25 only with AMI."
18 I'll ask you, what is the date of these texts?

19 A July 28th. 12 Is it safe to assume from your joke that you had an 13 understanding that if you were to close your deal, this would 14 somehow benefit the candidate, Donald Trump?

Page 1725 2 correct?

1 Q That's a text from Dylan. That means Dylan Howard; 3 A Yes.

4 Q What did you understand that to mean? 5 A I -- I understand the first part, the first sentence. 6 I'm not so sure I understand the second sentence.

7 Q Okay.

8 Well, tell us about the part you do understand.

9 A "She'll get more out of a deal with AMI than ABC," I
10 think that's self-explanatory. 11 And Dylan was making his case why they were the right 12 avenue for Karen to choose.

13 Q Okay.

14 How did you respond? 15 A "I need this to happen." 16 Q Now, Mr. Davidson, based on non-privileged 17 communications to which you were privy, why did you need this 18 to happen?

19 Why did Karen McDougal prefer the AMI deal to the ABC deal? 20 A Because she -- at that time -- at that time, based on 21 non-privileged information, she had announced her desire to not 22 tell the story about her interaction with Donald Trump.

23 Q So that -- withdrawn.

24 Part of the allure of the AMI deal was that she wouldn't 25 have to; is that your understanding?

Page 1726 1 A Yes.

2 Q I am showing you now People's 280 in evidence.

3 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
4 Q I'm going to ask you if you recognize this? 6 Q What is it?

7 A This is -- it's a meeting invitation, a Zoom 8 invitation from me to Jay Grdina, Karen McDougal, and Dylan 9 Howard.

10 Q You said "Zoom". 11 Is it a video conference? Is Ring Central a video 12 conferencing platform, much like Zoom?

13 A Yes.

14 Q Who did you invite? 15 You just told us. 16 Did this meeting, in fact, take place on this day? 17 A I believe -- it definitely took place. I assume it 18 took place this day.

19 Q The date of the invite was August 2, 2016? 20 A Yes. 21 MR. STEINGLASS: Is this a good time to break?

23 lunch.

22 THE COURT: Jurors, let's take our recess for 24 I remind you, please, do not discuss this case 25 among yourselves or with anyone else.

14 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 15 BY MR. STEINGLASS: 16 Q Good afternoon, Mr. Howard [sic]. 17 I just want to put -- that's the second time.

18 Good afternoon, Mr. Davidson.

19 I want to show you part of a text exchange we were looking 20 at before lunch. This is from People's 176A, Lines -- Page 6, 21 Lines 292 to 293. 22 (Whereupon, exhibits are shown on the screens 23 throughout the following testimony.)
24 Q So, that last text that's sent on July 29th at 2:24 AM 25 UTC time, is that text to you from Dylan Howard or the other Page 1729 1 way around?

2 A It's from Dylan Howard to me.

3 Q And, so, when Dylan Howard said, "I need this to 4 happen," how did you interpret that? 5 A I don't know. I suppose I interpreted it that he 6 wanted it to happen.

8 AMI?

7 Q You mean, "it" being the deal with Karen McDougal and 9 A Yes, sir.

10 Q Okay. 11 Continuing on with this exhibit to the next page, Page 7, 12 I'm going to blow up Lines 314 to 319.

13 Again, I'll ask you to give us the date, the to and the 14 from, and the substance of these emails -- texts. 15 A You want me to read right through all of them? 16 Q Sure. 17 Start with the date and time of the first one, please.

18 A This is August 2nd, from me to Dylan Howard: "I can't 19 believe they are asking me to go back to you for another 25 but 20 they are. He deal is accepted at 150. Can you do that?" 22 First of all, does "25" mean "25,000"?

23 A Yes.

24 Q And "he deal", should that read "the deal"? 25 A Yes.

21 Q A couple of questions about that.

Page 1730

1 Q Who was asking you to go back for another $25,000?

2 A It would be Mr. Grdina and Karen McDougal.
3 Q And how did Dylan Howard respond?

4 A "He just called me. 'F' it. Not my money. I'll ask." 5 Q When you said, "F it," is the full "F" word written 6 out in the text?

7 A Yes.

8 Q What did you understand that to mean?

9 A Um, that someone just called him, and that he didn't 10 care about money because it wasn't his; he would run it up the 11 flagpole.

12 Q "He didn't care about money; he would run it up the 13 flagpole;" you're referring to Dylan Howard?

15 Q Okay. 16 The next text please, who is that from? 17 A From me, to Dylan: "Let's try and wrap up Karen's 18 deal. She is getting repeated phone calls from Rhonda 19 Schwartz." 20 Q What did you mean by that? 21 A That the deal was getting stale. It had been left on 22 the counter for a bit. And if he wanted to close it up, now was 23 the time.

24 Q Who is Rhonda Schwartz? 25 A Rhonda was with the Investigation Department at ABC
14 A Yes.

Page 1731 1 News. She works or worked for Brian Ross.

2 Q Okay. 3 How did he respond? 4 A Dylan responded: "We are figuring out the mechanics 5 of the deal already." 6 Q What did you understand that to mean? 7 A Just, that they were figuring out how to paper the 8 deal. 9 Q Paper the deal between Karen McDougal and AMI?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Did he add something after that? 12 A "Right now I mean." 13 Q Did you respond? 14 A I responded: "Got it." 15 Q Okay. 16 Also, on Page 7, Lines 320 and 321, what is the date of 18 A August 5, 2016. 19 Q And who sent the first text in this blown-up portion 20 of these -- this exchange? 21 A Dylan Howard to me. 22 "Cameron's" -- excuse me. 23 This is August 5, 2016. It's from me to Dylan. 24 Q Okay. 25 What did you say?

17 this exchange?

Page 1732 1 A "Cameron's agreement wasn't really even close to what 2 we were expecting. Please review the red-line I just sent. Need 3 to handle this quickly."
4 Q First of all, who is "Cameron"? 5 A Cameron Stracher is General Counsel for AMI. 6 Q What is a "red-line"?

7 A A "red-line" is just modifications or corrections to 8 an editable document that's like -- it's a step along the way 9 in modifying a document.

12 A We had come to terms by this point with AMI on the 23 A Correct.

24 Q So, when you refer to "the red-line", does that mean 25 you made proposed changes to the contract they had sent over 19 Q So, do I understand you correctly to be saying that 20 Cameron had sent you a contract, and it did not match your 21 understanding of what you thought the deal was that had been 22 negotiated between yourself and Mr. Howard?

13 deal points. And there was a Short-Form Agreement or at least 14 deal points. And that that was negotiated between Dylan and I. 15 And then Dylan, as a content editor, handed it off to the Legal 16 Department at AMI, Cameron. And when the Short-Form Agreement 17 or the deal points morphed into the Long-Form Agreement with 18 Cameron, they didn't jive.

10 Q So, what did you mean when you said that his agreement 11 wasn't close to what you were expecting?

Page 1733 1 and sent it back?

2 A I believe so.

3 But, it -- the red lines were either extremely extensive --
4 I mean, it was difficult to red-line something that didn't even 9 Why was there a need to "handle this quickly"?

10 A Just, on my side of the aisle, there was a growing 11 frustration with the process.

12 Q And how, if at all, did Dylan Howard respond to your 13 text?

14 A "I asked Cam to call you." 15 Q Continuing on to the next page and directing your 16 attention to the blown-up line, which is 322.

19 Q And can you read us that text, please? 20 A "He" -- this is from me to Dylan. "He wants me to call 21 Cohen. You think that's okay? I've been trying like hell to 22 avoid that."
23 Q What did you mean by that?

24 First of all, who wanted you to call him? 25 A Cam. Cameron Stracher.

5 closely resemble, I believe to my recollection, the deal points 6 that we came up with.

7 Q And you ended the text by saying: "Need to handle this 8 quickly."
17 Did you send another text that same day?

18 A Yes.

Page 1734 1 Q And what was your understanding of why Cam wanted you 2 to call Michael Cohen?

3 A (No response).

4 Q Withdrawn. 5 Between that last text and this text, did you have a 6 conversation on the phone with Cameron?

7 A I did.

8 Q Can you tell us about it?

9 A Not only -- not only were we not on the same page 10 between the Short-Form and the Long-Form, and then Dylan asked 11 me to call Cameron; and I did call Cameron, and even when we 12 spoke, we still weren't on the same page. I think I told him 13 that. I know I told him that.

14 I said, "Look, this agreement doesn't nearly comport to 15 what was agreed to in the deal points." 16 I think I was frustrated. 17 He was frustrated, and he said, "Why don't you just call 18 Cohen?"
19 Q "He", meaning Cam suggested you call Cohen? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Did you ask Mr. Stracher why he wanted you to call 22 Michael Cohen if Michael Cohen had nothing to do with the deal?

23 A I -- I believe so. I probably did. I don't have a 24 specific recollection. 25 I thought it was odd, certainly.

Page 1735 1 Q Sorry?

2 A I thought it was odd.

3 Q And so, what did you mean when you said, "I've been 4 trying like hell to avoid that?" 5 A My first interaction with Michael Cohen was in 2011, 6 regarding that blog post that we discussed earlier. And my 7 interaction with him around that time in 2011 was -- was not 8 pleasant or -- or constructive, and I didn't particularly like 9 dealing with him. And that's why I was trying like hell to 10 avoid talking to him. 11 Q Continuing on this text string from the same day, 12 did -- I'm speaking, specifically, of Page 8, Lines 326 through 13 330. I'll just ask you to, again, read us through these texts, 14 who sent them, and what they mean. 15 A August 5th, from Dylan Howard to me: "Okay. We are 16 paying." 17 Q Let me stop you right there for a second.

18 What did you understand that to mean?

19 A That they were ready to pay for the deal. 20 Q Okay. 21 How did you respond? 22 Or, how -- I guess, is that next text another text from 23 Dylan Howard?

24 A Yes. 25 Q What does it say?

Page 1736 1 A "Glad it all sorted."
2 Q And then, did he say anything else?

3 A "Fucken Jesus."
4 Q You're quoting, so it's okay.

7 A I think it was just a frustrating deal for everybody 8 involved, and it was -- it was just a lot of, sort of, heavy 9 lifting.

10 Q And then what did you say? 11 A "Yes -- I believe so. I told Cohen this never would 12 have happened without you."
13 Q How did Dylan Howard respond to that?

14 A "He's hopeless. Oh well. Another one done." 15 Q So, from this text exchange, does it appear -- let me 16 ask this a different way. 17 Did you call Cohen at some point in the middle of this text 18 exchange?

19 A I recall that I did, yes. 20 Q And did you discuss the Karen McDougal contract with 21 him at all? 22 A Yes.

23 Q And I'll come back to exactly how that conversation 24 went in a minute. 25 I want to take a minute to show you Grand Jury -- I'm sorry 5 Did you have any understanding of what that all meant, 6 those three texts?

Page 1737 1 -- to show you People's Exhibit 62, which is in evidence.

2 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
3 Q I'll just ask if you recognize this?

4 A Yes. 5 Q What is it? 6 A This is an email from me to Michael Cohen, asking him 7 to call me.

8 Q And what is the date of this email?

9 A August 5, 2016.

10 Q And the time? 11 A 2:54 PM. Probably, Pacific Time.

12 Q Do you know if you produced this document or if this 13 was produced by The Trump Organization?

14 You want to look at the Bates stamp at the bottom? 15 A Sure. 16 Q On the -- on the documents that you produced, do your 17 Bates start with the letters KMD?

18 A It did.

19 Q Does that indicate to you this may have been produced 20 by The Trump Organization? 21 A It did. 22 Q Does that clarify at all whether the timestamp on this 23 email was Eastern Time or Pacific Time, or you're not sure?

24 A I'm not sure. 25 I know I called him after the deal closed with AMI and Page 1738 1 Karen.

2 Q This seems like a good opportunity to just tell us 3 about the conversation you had with Michael Cohen.

4 A I seem to recall that after the deal closed with 5 Michael Cohen -- excuse me. 6 After the deal closed with AMI, I called Michael Cohen.

7 And I can't recall specifically whether -- maybe Dylan asked me 8 to or something, but I called him and let him know, as a 9 professional courtesy, that the deal involving his client had 10 closed. 11 And I told him, as I stated to you and Dylan Howard, that:
12 "This deal wouldn't have happened without Dylan."
13 Q Now, you said that you called Michael Cohen as a 14 professional courtesy because the deal involving his client 15 closed. 16 What client is that? 17 A Donald Trump.

18 Q Was Donald Trump a party to this agreement, a named 19 party to this agreement between yourself or between, I should 20 say, Karen McDougal and AMI? 21 A No. 22 Q Did you recognize the extent to which the deal could 23 benefit Mr. Cohen's client, Donald Trump?

24 A Yes. 25 Q What was Michael Cohen's reaction when you told him Page 1739 1 that the deal was closed?

2 A He was pleased.

3 Q Now, that deal between AMI and Karen McDougal, did 4 that eventually -- did the contract eventually get signed? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And, generally speaking, what were the terms?

7 A There was a financial aspect of the deal. I think it 8 was $150,000. It involved certain personal services that Karen 9 would render to AMI, which included, um, magazine covers, 10 weekly or monthly columns where she could write on subject 11 matters that interested her, um, and I believe that was it.

12 Q As part of that deal, did AMI acquire Karen McDougal's 13 limited life story rights to any romantic, personal and/or 14 physical relationship with any then-married man? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Just to be clear, who negotiated these terms on behalf 17 of AMI?

18 A Mainly, Dylan Howard, and then Cameron got involved at 19 some point. 20 Q And on behalf of Karen McDougal? 21 A I did. 22 Q I am now showing you what's in evidence already as 23 People's Exhibit 156.

24 MR. STEINGLASS: Can you show them to everyone? 25 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
Page 1740 1 Q Is this the final deal signed between AMI and Karen 2 McDougal?

3 A Assuming that it's signed.

5 that. 4 Q Well, we can skip to the last page, and I'll show you 6 (Whereupon, another page of the exhibit is shown 7 on the screens.)
8 A Yes. This is the final deal.

9 Q And going back to that first page for a minute, just 10 blowing up the top portion, what is the "Effective Date" on 12 A August 5, 2016.

13 Q I am going to blow up Paragraph 3.

14 I am just going to ask you to read it to yourself. You 15 don't have to read the whole thing out loud. 16 Read it to yourself, and let us know what you understood 17 this paragraph to mean.

18 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 19 his screen.) 20 A Well, I'm ready. 21 Q Okay. 22 Can you tell us what it means?

23 A That Karen had, in the process of entering into this 24 contract with AMI, that she granted her Limited Life Rights 25 related to the subject matter, any affairs she had with any 11 this contract?

Page 1741 1 then-married man to AMI.

2 So that became, in effect, their intellectual property, 3 their exclusive intellectual property.

4 Q Now, based on non-privileged communications to which 5 you were privy, was there a particular then-married man with 6 whom you understood this to apply?

7 A Yes.

8 Q Who?

9 A Donald Trump.

10 Q I'm going to move to Paragraphs 4 and 5 and ask you, 11 first of all, does Paragraph 4 contain the amount that AMI was 12 compensating Karen McDougal for her Limited Life Rights, as 13 well as some of the other services that you mentioned?

14 A Yes.

15 Q How much was she being paid? 16 A 150,000.
17 Q How much of that went to you?

18 A Somewhere between -- I think 45 percent.

19 Q And Paragraph 5, can you read that paragraph out loud? 20 A Paragraph 5: "Nothing herein shall obligate AMI to use 21 the Life Rights in connection with any media. AMI's obligations 22 to McDougal shall be the payment to McDougal of the sum set 23 forth in Paragraph 4 and the obligations set forth in Paragraph 24 1, 2.1 and 2.2. 25 Q Those paragraphs, 1, 2.1, 2.2, does that set out the Page 1742 1 other services that you mentioned?

2 A Yes.

3 Q What does this paragraph mean, Paragraph 5?

4 A It means that it was really AMI's option as to whether 5 or not they ever wanted to run the story of Karen's interaction 6 with any then-married man or not. It was their option to either 7 run it or not.

8 Q Now, at the time this agreement was executed, did you 9 believe AMI intended to publish the story?

10 A No. 11 Q Why did you believe that? 15 Q Did you have an understanding as to why AMI would be 16 purchasing a story that they didn't intend to print? 17 A I think there were two.

18 I think one was -- one explanation that was given was that 19 they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn't want to 20 diminish her reputation. 21 And the second was more of an unspoken understanding that 22 there was a close affiliation between David Pecker and Donald 23 Trump, and that AMI would not run this story or any story 24 related to Karen and Donald Trump as it would tend to hurt 25 Donald Trump.

12 A I believe it was stated.

13 Q Stated by whom, if you remember?

14 A AMI.

Page 1743 1 Q When you say "hurt Donald Trump", you mean hurt Donald 2 Trump's campaign?

3 A Yes.

4 Q Thank you. 5 I want to show you Page 2, Paragraph 7. 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 Q Again, I'm not going to ask you to read this whole 8 paragraph out loud.

9 You can just read it to yourself, and when you're done, 10 maybe you can tell us what it means. 11 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 12 his screen.)
13 A This is really an Exclusivity paragraph. It means the 14 rights that Karen was transferring to AMI were Exclusive, and 15 she could not -- she could not -- she retained no intellectual 16 property rights in the story for herself; and that's one. 17 And, two, that she cannot transfer them, subsequently, to 18 anybody else.

19 Q She no longer owned her own story? 20 A The limited story. 21 Q The portion of the story that dealt with her affair 22 with Donald Trump?

23 A Fair.

24 Q Is that true? 25 A True.

Page 1744 1 Q What would happen, according to this paragraph, if 2 Karen McDougal did take her story elsewhere?

3 A The last sentence is a liquidated damages provision.

4 She would owe back, basically, the 150. 5 Q Would she owe back the entire $150,000, even though 6 she was doing magazine covers and columns?

7 A Pardon?

8 Q Would she owe back the entire 150,000, even though she 9 was still doing the columns and magazine covers?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Going back to that signature on Page 3, did Karen 12 McDougal sign this document?

13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
14 A Yes. 15 MR. STEINGLASS: Can you blow up the bottom, 16 please? 17 A Yes. Yes.

18 Q And --
19 MR. STEINGLASS: Can you blow up a little more of 20 the bottom? 21 Q I would like to know what date she signed it 22 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 23 his screen.)
24 A Yeah. 25 This is Johnny Crawford that we mentioned earlier, which is Page 1745 1 a notary.

2 August 6, 2016.

3 Q And who, if anyone, signed the Agreement on behalf of 4 AMI?

7 Q So, Dylan Howard's title is listed.

8 Do you recognize whether or not that's his signature?

9 A Not particularly.

10 Q Okay. 11 Let's go back to People's 176A in evidence. Specifically, 12 Page 9, Lines 357 to 61.

13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
14 Q I'm going to ask you, this is this another text 15 exchange between you and Dylan Howard from August 5, 2016? 16 A Yes. 17 MR. STEINGLASS: Let me double-check one moment.

18 I think I misspoke.

19 Q Is this a text exchange between you and Dylan Howard 20 from August 8th of 2016? 21 A Yes. 22 What was the date of that AMI? The 5th? That last exhibit?

24 We can pull that back up. 25 I believe you told us it was signed on August 6th.

5 A I don't -- it looks to be Chief Content Officer, which 6 would be Dylan Howard.

23 Q I don't want to testify.

Page 1746 1 Let me show you the first page in terms of the Effective 2 Date.

3 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
4 A Fair enough. 5 Thank you. 6 Q So, just for the record, what is the Effective Date of 7 the contract?

8 A August 5, 2016.

9 Q Okay.

10 Going back now to what we were showing you before, some 11 texts on Page 9 of 176A.

12 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
13 Q Lines 357 to 61.

14 And were these texts back and forth sent on August 8th, and 15 at the very bottom August 9th, of 2016? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And what do the texts say, please?

18 A This is from me to Dylan: "I am going to let ABC know 19 that Karen has decided to keep her story quiet. I'm going to 20 let them know that the family has begged and pleaded with her 21 to not come out and that she has promised her family she 22 wouldn't. I will have Karen ignore all of their calls. Any 23 objection?"
24 Q What did you mean by that? 25 A I stated before we had parallel negotiations with AMI
Page 1747 1 and ABC, and I needed to, sort of, off-board ABC. And I'll 2 leave it at that.

3 Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

4 A "Yep, that's fine." 5 Q And what did you say after that? 6 A (Laughs) Um, "By the way, they promised her a role on 7 Dancing With the Stars, season 578568655."
8 Q Was the number of the season another joke?

9 A Yes.

10 Q Does "BTW" stand for "by the way"? 11 I know that is a silly question.

12 A Yes.

13 Q Had a potential role on Dancing With the Stars been 14 part of the package that you were negotiating with ABC on 15 behalf of Ms. McDougal? 16 A It was discussed a lot. Um, and it was -- there was an 17 inference that best efforts would be made to make that happen, 18 but it was never guaranteed, and it was never part of the deal.

19 But -- best -- best efforts were discussed. 20 Q Okay. 22 A "Ha." A laugh.

23 Q Did he send you another text?

24 A Yes. 25 "Payment will be made this week. FYI -- sooner rather than 21 And how did Dylan respond?

Page 1748 1 later. Is it going to you?"
2 Q Okay.

3 Thank you very much.

4 MR. STEINGLASS: You can take that down. 5 Q Mr. Davidson, do you know someone named Stormy 6 Daniels?

7 A Yes.

8 Q In what context?

9 A Stormy Daniels was a client of mine.

10 Q And are you aware of her going by any other names? 11 A Stephanie Clifford.

12 Q How did it come to be that you represented Stormy 13 Daniels?

14 A Stormy Daniels was a talent, and she was managed by 15 Gina Rodriguez, who we discussed earlier. 16 And, so, Gina referred Stormy to me. 17 Q Got it.

18 And what was your understanding of the relationship at the 19 time between Stormy Daniels and Gina Rodriguez at the time? 20 A Gina was a talent manager, and Stormy was talent. 21 Q Was -- so, I guess my question is, was Gina Stormy's 22 manager?

23 A Yes.

24 Q When you said -- earlier, you told us about a 2011 25 encounter Gina had with Michael Cohen and also involved Stormy Page 1749 1 Daniels?

2 A Yes.

3 Q In 2011, did you ever speak to Stormy Daniels, or did 4 you deal exclusively with Gina Rodriguez, or someone else? 5 A I think I had a brief conversation with Stormy and 6 Gina.

7 Q In 2011?

8 A Yeah.

9 But, most of my conversations, I believe, were with Gina.

10 Q What, if anything, did you do on behalf of Stormy 11 Daniels in 2011?

12 A Sent a Cease-and-Desist Letter to the blog that we 13 mentioned earlier, The Dirty.com.

14 Q So, the name of the blog is The Dirty.com? 15 A Yes. 16 Q What was the nature of the story that was on the blog 17 that caused you to send the Cease-and-Desist Letter?

18 A There was a blog post or a story posted on the website 19 that stated that Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump had -- had 20 some sort of a physical or romantic, um, interaction. 21 Q So, you said that in connection with this effort on 22 your part, that you had a conversation with Michael Cohen?

23 A Yes.

24 Q Can you tell us how that came about and how that 25 conversation went?

Page 1750 1 A Yes.

2 Michael Cohen -- the blog post had published. And, 3 apparently -- or, I was informed that Gina had received a phone 4 call from Michael Cohen. And the phone call that she received 5 from Michael Cohen, I think it was a voicemail. I know it was a 6 voicemail. And it might have either been a voicemail or a phone 7 call that was answered by Gina's ex-husband.

8 In any event, Gina called me up to tell me that: "Some jerk 9 called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue 10 me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back." 11 Q I hate to ask it this way, but who was that "jerk"?

12 A It was Michael Cohen.

13 Q So, what happened when you called -- did you call 14 Michael Cohen? 15 A I did. 16 Q Tell us about that. 17 A Gina provided me the number that he left, either with 20 I introduced myself. And before I could barely get my name 21 out, I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and 22 insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.

23 Q What was the gist of what he was accusing you of?

24 A (Pause) I don't think he was accusing us of anything. 25 He was just screaming.

18 her ex or on the voicemail. It was for The Trump Organization.

19 I called. I was transferred to Michael Cohen.

Page 1751 1 Q Okay.

2 What was he upset about?

3 A He was upset that -- that the story on The Dirty.com 4 got published, and he believed that Stormy Daniels was the 5 source behind the story. 6 Q So, what did you tell him?

7 A Well, finally, um, after he finished, I -- I explained 8 to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, 9 did not want the story published, and I wanted to see if he had 10 done anything to contact The Dirty to get that story taken down 11 as of that time.

12 He told me that he had not yet done anything.

13 And then, when I told him that my client wanted it taken 14 down, he was like: "Well, why don't you go have them do it and 15 let me know how you make out." 16 Q How -- withdrawn.

18 A Yes.

19 Q What happened as a result of you sending that 20 Cease-and-Desist Letter? 21 A I was successful in accomplishing my client's goals, 22 in having that story taken down.

23 Q That was in 2011?

24 A Yes. 25 Q Now, in the Summer and Fall of 2016, did you resume 17 You said you sent a Cease-and-Desist Letter; right?

Page 1752 1 representation of Stormy Daniels in the matter of her liaison 2 with Mr. Trump?

3 A In the Summer of 2016?

4 Q Yes.

7 You can clarify.

8 A I -- no, I don't believe so. I don't think it was 9 until the Fall.

10 Q Okay. 11 So, let me show you what's in evidence as People's 176A.

12 This is that same set of text messages. I want to go back to 13 Page 4; specifically, Lines 175 to 177.

14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 15 Q Again, I'll ask you, is this another text exchange 16 between you and Dylan Howard? 17 A Yes.

19 A June 30, 2016. 20 Q What do the texts say? 21 A This is from Dylan to me: "FYI Gina trying to hawk 22 Stormy again."
23 Q What did you understand that to mean?

24 A Part of Gina's role and responsibility or services 25 that she provided was to monetize stories in the press. She was 18 Q What is the date of this exchange?

5 The Summer -- actually, I think the question was, Summer 6 and Fall.

Page 1753 1 like a story broker.

2 And Dylan, obviously, was a purchaser of stories.

3 So, I interpreted from this text that Dylan had been 4 approached by Gina, who was trying to sell the story regarding 5 Stormy and Donald Trump again. 6 Q And did you respond in some way?

7 A I responded: "LOL -- she's trying to sell a story to 8 you?", question mark.

9 Q "LOL", is that texting lingo for "laugh out loud"?

10 A It is. 11 Q How did Dylan respond?

12 A "Yep."
13 Q How did you interpret that whole exchange? What did 14 you interpret that to mean? 15 A As I previously stated, that Gina was trying to -- was 16 bringing this story back to market. 17 Q And that she had contacted Dylan Howard about it?

18 A Yes.

19 Q Now, did there come a point in time in which interest 20 in the Stormy Daniels story increased? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Can you explain that a little bit?

23 A Um, well, in 2011, we know that The Dirty published 24 their story. And I think I later learned that there was some 25 other interest in 2011 from In Touch Magazine.

Page 1754 1 Years went by. At least five years went by until that last 2 text message with Dylan.

3 Um, and, really, there was very little -- to Gina's 4 dissatisfaction, very little interest in the story publishing 5 or in the marketability of the story. 6 Um, this -- this continued through the Summer from what I
7 understand. I was not involved. But, through the Summer into 8 the Fall, where there was still being very little interest, 9 despite the fact that Mr. Trump's notoriety was gaining.

10 Q Directing your attention to October 7th -- excuse 11 me -- of 2016. 14 A Yes. 15 Q And, briefly, for the jury, what is the Access 16 Hollywood tape? 17 A The Access Hollywood tape, from what I understand, 18 was -- was what's called a hot mic, which is a microphone 19 that's recording. Um, and I think the insinuation when you say 20 "hot mic" is it's live and recording, but perhaps unknown to 21 the person who is mic'd. 22 So, this was an incident where Donald Trump and Billy Bush 23 was in the van. They were on the set of Access Hollywood, or it 24 was released by Access Hollywood. I don't even know. 25 There was an allegation that -- at least a record -- the 12 Did you come to learn about the release of something that's 13 known as the Access Hollywood tape?

Page 1755 1 hot mic recorded some statements by both men, um, that were 2 troublesome.

3 Q What impact, if any, did the release of the Access 4 Hollywood tape have on interest in Stormy Daniels' story, so 5 far as you were aware? 6 A So far as I'm aware, it had tremendous influence.

7 Q Can you explain that a little bit to the jury, please?

8 A Before -- yes.

9 Before Access Hollywood tape, there was very little, if any 10 interest, from what I understand, and Gina was trying to sell 11 the Stormy Daniels/Donald Trump story.

12 It wasn't until Access Hollywood that interest sort of 13 reached a crescendo.

14 Q So, going back to People's 176A in evidence, 15 specifically on Page 1761, Lines 482 to 494. Is this another 16 text exchange between you and Dylan Howard on October 8th and 17 October 9th of 2016?

18 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
19 A Yes. 20 Q Who sent the first text in this chain? 21 A It's from me. 22 Q And what did you say?

23 A "Trump is F'd."
24 Q You wrote the whole word out, "F'd", in the text? 25 A I did.

Page 1756 1 Q What prompted you to say that Trump was "F'd"?

2 A The Access Hollywood tape.

3 Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

4 A He responded with a: "Wave the white flag. It's over 5 people!", explanation point. 6 Q And how did you interpret that?

7 A I think he was seconding my opinion.

8 Q Based on the Access Hollywood tape?

9 A Yes.

10 Q What did you say after that? 11 A Well, this is the next day. It looks like from Keith 12 to Dylan: "Hi, the story is already out there."
13 Q And did you send that along with a link to The 14 Dirty.com? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Is that the same article in Dirty dot com which you 17 had successfully removed five years earlier?

18 A Yes.

19 They republished the same article. 21 A Yes. 20 Q After the Access Hollywood tape? 22 Q What did Dylan say at that point?

23 A His response on October 9th was: "Yeah" -- excuse me.

24 "Yeah, but her talking and taping blank is the final nail in 25 the coffin. Dot dot dot. But he's -- he's fucked already."
Page 1757 1 Q What did you mean by that?

2 A That was Dylan who was the author of that.

3 Q I'm sorry.

4 What did you understand that to mean? 5 A That The Dirty post was bad, but it could get a lot 6 worse.

7 Q How could it get a lot worse?

8 A If she made comment.

9 Q In other words, The Dirty.com story was kind of a 10 third-party account; that would be different from one of the 11 participants in a sexual encounter publicly revealing the 12 details of that?

13 A Precisely.

14 Q Then, how did you respond to that? 15 A "He really is." 16 Q Now, around that time, did you become involved in 17 negotiating a deal on behalf of Stormy Daniels?

18 A No.

19 Q Okay. 20 Did you work on a deal involving Stormy Daniels? 21 A Ultimately, I did. 22 Q Well, how did that come about?

23 A (No response).

24 Q You should explain whatever hesitation you have here. 25 A Gina, after the Access Hollywood tape, she went Page 1758 1 directly to Dylan and negotiated a deal with Dylan, outside of 2 me. I had nothing to do with that deal.

3 And I believe they came to terms.

4 Q I'm sorry? 5 A I believe they came to terms.

8 A Yes.

9 Q And how did that conversation go?

10 A I don't -- I don't recall. Other than what has already 12 Q Okay.

13 So, let me show you People's 178A in evidence.

14 MR. STEINGLASS: So everyone can see it. 15 Q I'm going to ask you, do you recognize this? 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 17 A Yes.

18 Q And is this a record of texts among yourself, Michael 19 Cohen and Dylan Howard? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Did you answer that? 22 A Yes. It is a record of texts between the three of us.

23 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we just un-blow it up for 24 one second? 25 Q How many texts are in this chain?

6 Q Did there come a time when you spoke with Dylan Howard 7 about the Stormy Daniels story?

11 been displayed.

Page 1759 1 A Two.

2 MR. STEINGLASS: Now we can blow it back up.

3 Thank you.

4 Q What is the date of these two texts? 5 A October 10th. 6 Q Of 2016?

7 A Yes.

8 Q And what is said during this text exchange?

9 A This is authored by Dylan: "Keith, slash, Michael.

10 Connecting you both in regards to that business opportunity. 11 Spoke to the client this AM and they're confirmed to proceed 12 with the opportunity. Thanks. Dylan."
13 Q What did you understand that to mean?

14 A Well, prior to this text, like I said, Gina and Dylan 15 had come to terms on an agreement that AMI had agreed to 16 purchase this story for $120,000. 17 Dylan and AMI backed out of that deal. It sort of fell 18 apart.

19 And Gina -- excuse me -- Dylan asked Gina to call Michael 20 Cohen and finish the deal with him. And Gina refused. 21 So, she asked me to call Cohen. And I refused. 22 And then Dylan called me to convince me to call Cohen.

23 Q So, can we just break that down?

24 A Sure. 25 Q Though you didn't use pronouns, so that was helpful.

Page 1760 1 A The moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to 2 Cohen.

3 Q Okay.

4 (Whereupon, the People and some jurors laugh.) 5 Q Can you walk us through that a little more slowly, 6 that Cohen got involved in this deal, notwithstanding the fact 7 that Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard had already negotiated the 8 deal?

9 A So, the Access Hollywood tape dropped. Gina and Dylan 10 came to terms at 120,000. Dylan backed out, which left that 11 deal up in the air. AMI did not want to complete the deal or 12 would not complete the deal. And Dylan asked Gina to call Cohen 13 and close the deal with him. Gina refused, and asked me to call 14 Cohen on behalf of Stormy and close the deal that had already 15 been agreed to. 16 Q So, Dylan sends this text, and then Dylan sends 17 another text?

18 A Yes.

19 Q What was the other text? 20 A "Over to the two of you." 21 Q Actually, it says: "Over to you two"? 22 A "Over to you two."
23 Q Who did you understand "you two" to mean?

24 A Michael Cohen and I. 25 Q Going back to that first text for a moment, what did Page 1761

1 you understand Dylan to be saying when he said: "Spoke to the 2 client this AM and they're confirmed to proceed with the 3 opportunity"?
7 handing the deal over to -- first, Gina to close; and then she 8 didn't want to do that; and, ultimately, me to close with 9 Cohen.

10 Q What was your understanding of Michael Cohen's 11 interest in the matter?

12 A I believe that -- I believe that Michael Cohen was 13 personal attorney or general counsel for Donald Trump, and that 14 this story involved his client, and that was his interest in 15 the story. 16 Q Was it it unusual -- withdrawn. 17 You said you had known Dylan Howard for years?

18 A Yes.

20 Howard? 19 Q And you had other business interactions with Dylan 21 A Yes. 22 Q Was it unusual for Dylan Howard to connect you to 23 someone outside of AMI to purchase a story?

24 A I think this is the only time that ever happened. 25 Q So, did there come a time, after this, that you spoke 6 He -- Dylan was washing his hands of the deal and sort of 4 A That he spoke to either Gina or Gina and Stormy, and 5 that they were confirmed to proceed.

Page 1762 1 with Michael Cohen about the Stormy Daniels story?

2 A Yes.

3 Q And do you remember -- withdrawn.

4 Tell us how that conversation went. 5 A Well, it was different than 2011. Um. And, it was 6 fairly conciliatory.

7 The deal had already been cut at $120,000.

8 And -- then, um, we -- we needed to pad the deal, um, to 9 compensate me now, because I was added to the deal, and Stormy 10 and Gina weren't gonna take a discount for involving me. So, 11 that 120 became 130.

12 Q So, when you say the deal is already cut at $120,000, 13 it was cut between Stormy Daniels and AMI; right?

14 A Yes. 15 Q Was this the same deal in your mind, a different deal? 16 How -- 17 A It was the same deal.

18 They were going to acquire the intellectual property rights 19 in this story, exclusive rights. 20 Q But, instead of AMI purchasing it, it was now Michael 21 Cohen, on behalf of Donald Trump? 22 A Well, after AMI washed their hands of the deal and 23 then they handed it -- handed it -- AMI handed it off to Cohen, 24 they -- in essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes. 25 Q And at the time that you got involved, had Michael Page 1763 1 Cohen already stepped into AMI's shoes?

2 A I believe so.

3 Q Did you negotiate -- withdrawn.

4 Did you -- you said you had to "pad the deal" so that you 5 could get compensated; is that right? 6 A Yes.

7 Q How did you "pad the deal" so you could get 8 compensated?

9 A Gina approached me. She said, "Hey, can we have this 10 deal?" She said, "It's going to be the easiest deal you've 14 Q That's what Gina said? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And did you know when you were dealing with Michael 17 Cohen that you were dealing with Donald Trump?

18 A Yes.

19 I never thought otherwise. 20 Q And how did you change the terms of the deal that had 21 previously been negotiated between Gina and Dylan Howard so 22 that you would be compensated now that the deal was between 23 Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen?

24 A I think a little of that happened even before my 25 involvement, and there was a -- when Dylan washed his hands of 11 ever done in your entire life." (Laughs). "It's already been 12 negotiated. It's already done. All you need to do is paper it 13 and talk to that asshole Cohen."
Page 1764 1 it, um, he and Gina had a conversation.

2 And -- and Gina said, "Well, look, we already have a deal
5 And Dylan said, "Don't worry about it. We'll make the deal 6 or Cohen will make the deal 150,000."
7 And then Gina called me, engaged me.

8 I called Cohen and picked it up.

9 Q And what was the price that you agreed on with Michael 10 Cohen? 11 A So, the 150 wasn't really true. Um, it turned out to 12 be 130. So, it was the original 120, plus 10,000.

13 Q I am now showing you People's Exhibit 63 in evidence.

14 I'm going to display Page 1. 15 MR. STEINGLASS: This is in evidence. Everyone can 16 see it. 17 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
18 Q Do you recognize this?

19 A Yes. 20 Q What is it? 21 A This is an email from me to Michael Cohen. 22 Q And what is the date of this email from you to Michael 23 Cohen?

24 A October 11, 2016. 25 Q Did the email contain attachments?

3 of 120. If I need to bring a lawyer into this, our net is going 4 to be reduced."
Page 1765 1 A Yes.

2 Q Are those attachments listed where it says 3 "attachments"?

4 A Yes. 5 Q What were the attachments to the email? 6 A Side Letter Agreement; Confidential Settlement 7 Agreement, and my firm's wiring instructions, bank wiring 8 instructions.

9 Q Who were the parties to the Settlement Agreement?

10 A It was Stormy Daniels on one side and -- you see the 11 subject line "SD"?

12 Q Yes.

13 A Stormy Daniels versus RCI.

14 Q What's "RCI"? 15 A "RCI" was an LLC that Michael told me he was going to 16 use to pay for this deal. 17 Q Do you know what that -- off the top of your head, do 18 you remember what that stands for?

19 A Resolution Consultants Incorporated, I believe. 20 Q Now, did the settlement use pseudonyms? 22 Q What was Stormy Daniels' pseudonym?

23 A "Peggy Peterson".

24 Q What was Donald Trump's pseudonym? 25 A I think it was "David Dennison".

21 A Yes.

Page 1766 1 Q Who came up with those pseudonyms?

2 A I did.

3 Q How?

4 A I used PP because she was the plaintiff, and DD 5 because he was the defendant. 6 Q Is David Dennison a real person?

7 A He was on my high school hockey team.

8 (Whereupon, people laugh.)
9 Q How does he feel about you now?

10 A He's very upset. 11 (Whereupon, people laugh.)
12 Q Now, one of the attachments that you mentioned was 13 called a Side Letter Agreement, I believe you said?

14 A Yes. 15 Q What's a Side Letter Agreement? 16 A The Side Letter Agreement is an addendum to an 17 underlying contract, and, um, it has terms to the original 18 contract.

19 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa 20 Magniccari relieves Senior Court Report Laurie Eisenberg, 21 and the transcript continues on the following page.) 22 23 24 25 Page 1767 1 (The following proceedings are continued from 2 previous page.)
3 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
4 BY MR. STEINGLASS:
7 A. The Side Letter Agreement -- the purpose for using a 8 Side Letter Agreement, it uses like code words that are used in 9 a military-like operation, so it ensures the further 10 confidentiality in case a fully executed contract was lost or 11 stolen. So even if that occurred, you wouldn't lose the 12 confidential nature of the document.

13 So the Side Letter Agreement is typically used in these 14 cases to identify the identity of the true parties involved. 15 And it's really for attorneys' eyes only. 16 Q. Okay.

23 Let's start with Paragraph 1.

24 A. Paragraph 1?

17 So, just to be clear, who were the two parties to this 18 agreement, whose names, whose identities were being protected?

19 A. Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump. 20 Q. One of the attachments also to this email -- withdrawn. 21 What did you say in the body of the email in which you 22 transmitted these documents?

5 Q. And is what was the purpose of using a side letter 6 agreement with this particular deal?

25 Q. Yes.

Page 1768 1 A. Would you like me to read it?

2 Q. Please.

7 "Under the terms of the agreement, neither my client 8 nor I are entitled to possession of the Side Letter Agreement."
9 That's Paragraph 1.

10 Q. I am sorry. 11 A. That's Paragraph 1.

12 Q. So why were you as the lawyer not entitled to keep a 13 copy?

14 A. Michael Cohen demanded that only he retain a copy of 15 the Side Letter Agreement. 16 Q. Is that unusual? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Paragraph 2, please?

19 A. "The settlement sum is $130,000. I have also attached 20 my firm's wiring instructions for your reference." 21 Q. Is that the clause that contains the payment being made 22 to Stormy Daniels?

23 A. Yes.

3 A. "Please fund Ms. Daniels' settlement agreement and Side 4 Letter Agreement attached." 5 "I have notified in the Side Letter Agreement (SLA) 6 which identities the parties to this agreement."
24 Q. And does that sum of $130,000 include your fee and Gina 25 Rodriguez's fee?

Page 1769 1 A. Yes, the gross. That's the gross. Yes.

2 Q. Okay. Thank you. 3 Paragraph 3. 4 A. "Ms. Daniels expressed dissatisfaction with your 5 schedule of a delay of ten days for funding." 6 "To that end, you'll see that I placed this Friday, 7 10/14/16, as the funding deadline. Let me know if there is a 8 problem." 9 Q. What is a funding deadline?

10 A. Well, the contract called for payment, a settlement 11 sum, and the funding deadline to which it must be funded. 12 Q. Did you actually receive payment from anyone on the 13 Trump side on October 14, 2016? 14 A. We did not. 15 Q. Do you know why not? 16 A. No. 17 Q. I'm showing you People's Exhibit 64 in evidence. Do 18 you recognize this? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Is this an email -- withdrawn. 21 What is this? 22 A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen. 23 Q. On what day? 24 A. October 12, 2016. 25 Q. What does it say on the subject line?

Page 1770 1 A. "Daniels."
2 Q. And just zooming back out for a minute. If we were to 3 read this exhibit chronologically, would we start at the 4 bottom? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Let's start at the bottom. Can you describe what is 7 said in this exchange?

8 A. "We good."
9 Q. Who said that?

10 A. I did. 11 Q. And how did Michael Cohen respond?

12 A. Yes. It's Yom Kippur, so the office is closed for all 13 purposes.

14 I will start over. "Yes, it's Yom Kippur so the office 15 is for all purposes closed. I am in tomorrow, but I can speak 16 for the next three hours via cell, if necessary." 17 Q. How, if at all, did you respond to that?

19 speak that day. I said: "It was not necessary to speak today." 20 You should have all the -- "you should have all the executed 21 documents a few days ago. Talk to you tomorrow." 22 Q. When you wrote the "executed documents," was that a 23 reference to the signed attachments that you sent the day before 24 that were part of People's 63 that we just saw? 25 A. Yes.

18 A. Because it was a holiday, I didn't feel the need to Page 1771 2 this?

1 Q. Showing you People's 65 in evidence. Do you recognize 3 A. Yes.

4 Q. What is this? 5 A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen on 6 October 14, 2016.

7 Q. And, among other things, are you re-forwarding the 8 email from October 11th, which included all those attachments we 9 just described?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Did it include the wiring instructions for a second 12 time?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. Why did you resend the documents? 15 A. Well, after the Yom Kippur email, which I at some point 16 began to think is an excuse for failure to fund -- there were 17 other excuses. And the other excuses included, you know, for 18 example, well, Yom Kippur, and included the fact that he didn't 19 have my wiring instructions. So I re-forwarded him the wiring 20 instructions. 21 Q. Okay. I am now showing you People's Exhibit 281 in 22 evidence. Do you recognize this?

23 A. Yes.

24 Q. Is this -- what is this? 25 A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen, dated Page 1772 1 October 17, 2016.

2 Q. And what is the subject line?

3 A. "PP versus DD. Important."
4 Q. And what does "PP" and "DD" refer to? 5 A. The pseudonyms that we used in the Settlement 6 Agreement.

7 Q. Peggy Peterson and David Dennison?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. You told us, I think, the date of the email was what?

10 A. October 17, 2016. 11 Q. And what was the domain of the email address that you 12 used for Michael Cohen when you sent this email?

13 A. TrumpOrg.com.

14 Q. Can you please read the email? 15 A. "Michael, I have been charged by my client with 16 forwarding the below message. We have a written Settlement 17 Agreement which calls for settlement payment to be made by the 18 end of business this past Friday, October 14, 2016. No payment 19 was received." 20 Next paragraph: "We spoke on Friday October 14, you 21 stated that the funds would be wired today, October 17, 2016. 22 No funds have been received as of the sending of this email."
23 Next paragraph: "My client informs me that she intends 24 to cancel the settlement contract if no funds are received by 25 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Please call me if you have any Page 1773 1 questions."
2 "Keith."
3 Q. What prompted you to send this email?

4 A. Their failure to meet the funding deadline repeatedly 5 and being met with a barrage of excuses as to why they had 6 failed.

7 Q. In addition to these emails back and forth between 8 yourself and Michael Cohen, were you also speaking with him on 9 the phone during this period?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Can you tell us, in general, every conversation -- can 12 you tell us, in general, what those conversations were like?

13 A. They were rather conciliatory, but it was sort of 14 circular arguments. It was excuses. It was contradictions. 15 Things that he was saying didn't make sense from one 16 conversation to the next. Again, the contradictions just didn't 17 leave me with a comfort level that there was a true intention to 18 fund the deal.

19 Q. Do you remember any of the other excuses that he gave 20 you? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Tell us some?

23 A. He stated that the computer systems were "all fucked 24 up." 25 He stated, "You can't believe what we're going through.

Page 1774

1 The Secret Service is in here. They have so many goddamn fire 2 walls. I can't get shit. It's not my fault. You're going to 3 have to resend the agreements again. I never got your emails."
4 Even though he previously told me he received them and the 5 wiring instructions.
6 I think that's it for this period of time that I can 7 recall.

8 Q. Did he ever make reference to Mr. Trump's whereabouts?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. What do you remember him saying about that? 11 A. I called him and said: Michael, this is a very bad 12 situation. I have a client and her rep Gina who is very upset.

13 It's making me look bad. And I don't believe really a word that 14 you are saying. 15 And then he said: Well, goddamn it, what do you expect 16 me to do? My guy is in five fucking states today or three or 17 four or five different states today. There is nothing I can do.

18 I am doing everything I can.

19 Q. When he said that "his guy" was in a certain number of 20 states, who did you understand "his guy" to be making reference 21 to? 22 A. Donald Trump.

23 Q. And what was the relevance based on your conversation 24 with Michael Cohen about -- what was the relevance of the fact 25 that Mr. Trump was in three or four or five different states?

Page 1775 1 A. What did that mean to me?

2 Q. What did it mean to you?

3 A. To me it was similar -- it's a situation I run into all 4 the time. It was similar to like someone who doesn't have the 5 purse strings. It's like an attorney has to go call an 6 insurance adjuster. Like that. Michael Cohen didn't have the 7 authority to actually spend money despite the fact there has 8 been so many excuses and funding deadlines that have already 9 been missed.

10 Q. You believe that Michael Cohen didn't have the 11 authority to spend the money?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Did he at some point say something to you about what he 14 would do to get the money? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. What did he say? 17 A. Well, I think you can tell by these emails that I was 18 sending him there was a great level of frustration by me and my 19 client -- clients and her rep. I let him know that the level of 20 dissatisfaction was quite high. And he stated, "Goddamn it, 21 I'll just do it myself." 22 Q. What did you understand him to mean when he said, "I'll 23 just do it myself?"
24 A. That he would not seek authority to consummate the 25 deal -- excuse me -- fund the deal. It was consummated with a Page 1776 1 signature. He would waive the authority in order to fund.

2 Q. Did you ever believe that Michael Cohen was going to be 3 the ultimate source of the funds?

4 A. Never, never prior to funding, no. 5 Q. Even after he said, "I'll just do it myself," where did 6 you understand the money would be coming from?

7 MR. BOVE: Objection.

8 THE COURT: Overruled.

9 A. From Donald Trump or some corporate affiliation 10 thereof. 11 Q. Okay.

12 So I am going to show you People's 282 in evidence.

13 Is this another email from you to Michael Cohen?

14 A. Yes. 15 Q. And what is the date and subject line? 16 A. October 17, 2016. 17 Q. And the subject?

18 A. "PP versus DD. Important."
19 Q. And the body of the email? 20 A. "Please be advised that my client deems her Settlement 21 Agreement cancelled and void Ab initio." 22 Q. And who did you mean by "my client?"
23 A. Stormy Daniels.

24 Q. And what does "Ab initio" mean? 25 A. It's a Latin term used in the law for void, I believe.

Page 1777 1 Void from the beginning of time, as if it never occurred at all.

2 Q. Why did you tell Michael Cohen that you no longer 3 represented Stormy Daniels in this deal or any other matter?

4 A. It was two-fold. 5 One: Because I divested myself of the case. 6 And, two: Because I didn't want to keep -- I didn't 7 want to receive a million frustrating phone calls from Michael.

8 He created this drama and this situation.

9 Q. Did you communicate with Stormy Daniels and/or Gina 10 Rodriguez around this time? 11 A. Yes.

12 Q. Which one?

13 A. Both.

14 Q. And what was the nature of that conversation? 15 A. I let them know that -- well, even leading up to this, 16 I let them know that -- well, they wanted frequent updates. 17 I would like to start over.

18 Q. Go ahead.

19 A. They wanted frequent updates and they received frequent 20 updates. The only updates I could give them were the repeated 21 excuses that I was hearing. That was a great source of 22 frustration.

23 And then when push came to shove, this is really --
24 this email that's displayed is the straw that broke the camel's 25 back. This is where push came to shove. This is when I said, Page 1778 1 hey, this deal is over. And I said to both Cohen and to my 2 client, "I'm out. Go in peace."
3 Q. During either that conversation, or another 4 conversation with Stormy Daniels and/or Gina Rodriguez, did they 5 express to you any views about what was happening here? 6 A. I'm not going to answer that question based on 7 attorney/client privilege.

8 Q. Fair enough.

9 Let me ask you this: Do you believe that you 10 represented Gina in this matter as well? 11 A. I don't mean to parse words, but I viewed Gina's role 12 in this situation as that of a manager, which would make her a 13 legal agent to my client Stormy Daniels. So if I was talking to 14 Gina, it was if I was talking to my client and the privilege 15 would exist. 16 Q. All right. 17 Did there come a time when you resumed your 18 involvement, notwithstanding this email, in the deal between 19 Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. How did that come about? 22 A. I don't have a specific recollection.

23 Q. Do you remember talking with Dylan Howard at any point 24 during this period of where you believed you were getting 25 excuses from Michael Cohen?

Page 1779 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Can you tell us about that conversation or 3 conversations that you had with Dylan Howard?

4 A. I recall having conversations with Dylan where I would 5 express that I believed Cohen was not being truthful. 6 Q. When you say you believed you expressed to Dylan that 7 Cohen was not being truthful, not being truthful about what?

8 A. About his excuses for failure to fund.

9 Q. What did you think was really happening?

10 A. What did I think was really happening? 11 Q. Yes, in terms of Michael Cohen's failure to fund.

12 What did you believe was really happening?

13 A. I thought he was trying to kick the can down the road 14 until after the election. 15 MR. STEINGLASS: Are we taking an afternoon 16 break? If so, this would be a good time. 17 THE COURT: All right; I will see you at 10 to 4.

18 (Jury leaving courtroom.)
19 (Witness leaving courtroom.) 20 THE COURT: Just give me a sense. I am not 21 rushing you. 22 MR. STEINGLASS: An hour and a half.

23 THE COURT: I will see you at 10 to 4.

24 (Recess.) 25 ***
Page 1780 1 THE CLERK: Continued case on trial, People versus 2 Donald J. Trump.

3 (Witness entering courtroom.)
4 THE COURT: Let's get the jury. 5 (Jury entering courtroom.) 6 THE COURT: Continuing case on trial, People 7 versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are 8 present.

9 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
10 BY MR. STEINGLASS: 11 Q. Good afternoon again, Mr. Davidson.

12 A. Good afternoon.

13 Q. I am going to show you People's 176A again.

14 Specifically, Page 10, lines 500 to 503. 16 Howard? 15 Is this the text exchange between yourself and Dylan 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And what is the date of these texts?

19 A. October 17, 2016. 20 Q. Through? 21 A. October 18, 2016. 22 Q. Okay. So who is the first text in this particular 24 A. This is from Dylan to me. 25 Q. What does it say?

23 exchange from?

Page 1781 1 A. "Cohen texting me if I have reached Gina."
2 I said: "She's not taking my calls again. I want 3 distance."
4 He writes back: "You're kidding me. One way they can 5 settle this impending storm." 6 Q. What did you understand this to mean?

7 A. That Cohen was leaning on Dylan to placate Gina.

8 Q. And -- withdrawn. Okay.

9 Did you respond?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. How did you respond?

12 A. "I can't believe Cohen let this go. It's going to be a 13 shit show."
14 Q. What did you mean by that? 15 A. Once I divested myself from the case and Gina and 16 Stormy were -- I think they were going to publicize the matter. 17 Q. When you say "publicize the matter," you mean through a 18 different media outlet?

19 A. Or many. 20 Q. Or many different media outlets. 21 So, specifically, what did you mean when you said "it's 22 going to be a shit show?"
23 A. I just felt like it was going to be more than a flurry 24 of activity. I felt it would be a tornado. 25 Q. When the story got out, if the story got out?

Page 1782 1 A. Yes.

2 Q. What did Dylan Howard say in response, if anything?

3 A. "Did they do the deal?"
4 Q. And what did you understand that to mean? 5 A. I think that Gina and Stormy had another deal, a backup 6 deal in the wings, and he was asking if they closed that 7 secondary deal.

8 Q. "He," being Dylan Howard?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. How did you respond? 11 A. "That's what I hear. I think it will be a full on 12 blitz."
13 Q. What did you mean by that?

14 A. That there would be tremendous media activity around 15 the subject of the story. 16 Q. Now, again, without getting into the substance of 17 privileged conversations, would you say you were talking during 18 this period more with Gina Rodriguez or more with Stormy Daniels 19 or about the same? 20 A. I think overall I was talking to Gina, overall, 85 21 percent of the time. When things got really heated, Stormy 22 participated more, but I think around this time it was probably 23 just Gina.

24 Q. Okay. 25 Moving onto Page 11, entries 504 to 506.

Page 1783 1 I think, continuing this exchange, how did Dylan 2 respond?

3 A. "I bet."
4 Q. And -- withdrawn. 5 Did he then send a follow up? 6 A. He did.

7 Q. And what did he say?

8 A. I am quoting Dylan, he said: "All because Trump is 9 tight."
10 Q. What did you understand that to mean? 11 A. That Mr. Trump was frugal.

12 Q. What relevance did this have to the conversation that 13 you were having with Dylan, Mr. Trump's frugality?

14 A. That they had this deal on a silver platter. It was 15 there for the taking. It didn't close. The only way it doesn't 16 close is because it didn't fund. The only reason it didn't fund 17 is because they didn't want to spend the money.

18 Q. During your dealings with Michael Cohen, did he tell 19 you who he was representing in these negotiations? 20 A. I don't think -- every single time I talked to Michael 21 Cohen, he leaned on his close affiliation with Donald Trump. I 22 don't know if it was ever explicitly said, "I am negotiating 23 this matter on behalf of Donald Trump," it was part of his 24 identity and he let me know it every opportunity he could, that 25 he was working for Donald Trump.

Page 1784 1 Q. And when you were negotiating the settlement agreement 2 with Michael Cohen, did you have an understanding of who was 3 ultimately going to be responsible for paying Ms. Daniels?

4 A. No. 5 Q. Let me show you privately Grand Jury Page 525. I 6 believe that's People's Exhibit 508A.

7 I am going to ask you, just yourself and the parties 8 and the Judge --
9 MR. BOVE: I object to this.

10 THE COURT: Approach. 11 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
12 MR. BOVE: The last question was: Do you have an 13 understanding of who was going to be ultimately 14 responsible? I am summarizing. The answer is no. 15 The witness didn't indicate there was any lack of 16 recollection. 17 Now we're basically -- the People's witness --
18 impeaching their testimony.

19 Either way, it should not be put in front of him 20 right now. The answer is the answer. It should stand. 21 THE COURT: Yes. 22 MR. STEINGLASS: I am deliberately not violating 23 Penal Law 60.35 by not asking him the substance of the 24 previous communication. I am showing it to him to refresh 25 his recollection without disclosing the content.

Page 1785 1 THE COURT: He hasn't stated he needs his 2 recollection refreshed. You haven't asked him.

3 So your objection is sustained.

4 MR. BOVE: He's been precise about refreshing his 5 recollection. He did not have such an understanding. It 6 would be improper to go back and say --
7 THE COURT: Let's see if it does.

8 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in 9 open court:)
10 THE COURT: Your objection is sustained. 11 Can you please read back the last question.

12 (Whereupon, the Official Court Reporter read back 13 the referred-to-question.)
14 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 15 BY MR. STEINGLASS: 16 Q. Mr. Davidson, have you previously testified about this 17 point in the Grand Jury in this case?

18 MR. BOVE: Objection.

19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Would reviewing that testimony help refresh your 21 recollection about your answer to that question? 22 MR. BOVE: Objection.

23 THE COURT: Overruled.

24 Please approach. 25 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
Page 1786 1 MR. BOVE: This is what I was concerned about at

2 the end of the last sidebar. The witness has not indicated 3 that he has a lack of recollection. To ask a leading 4 question to try to drive him to say, yes, I do have an 5 absence of recollection so it could be refreshed, that is
6 improper. The answer should stand.

7 MR. STEINGLASS: The whole point, how should I
8 find out if he needs his recollection refreshed or ask 9 him?

10 THE COURT: He hasn't said he could have his 11 recollection refreshed. He gave an answer. That's his 12 answer.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: I don't know if this is 14 appropriate, but, you know, the fact that there was a very 15 long pause between the answer that he gave and the question 16 that I asked, that is part of why I am seeing if something 17 could refresh his recollection. I could acknowledge that 18 he gave the answer.

19 THE COURT: You could go back and ask. 20 MR. STEINGLASS: I can do that. 21 THE COURT: Just in fairness, Mr. Bove, you might 22 have a few times yourself --
23 MR. BOVE: In the context where I get to lead the 24 witness. 25 THE COURT: That's true.

Page 1787 1 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in 2 open court:)
3 THE COURT: Okay.

4 The objection is sustained. 5 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 6 BY MR. STEINGLASS:
7 Q. Mr. Davidson, I notice when I asked you that last 8 question about what your understanding was about who was going 9 to be ultimately responsible, you paused before you gave your 10 answer; is that true? 11 A. Yes.

12 Q. Does that pause -- is that pause any indication that 13 you might want to have your recollection refreshed?

14 MR. BOVE: Objection. 15 THE COURT: Sustained to form. 16 Q. As you sit here -- 17 A. Can I have the question read back?

18 Q. Which question? It was sustained. I don't think it 19 can be read back. 20 Let me ask a different question. 21 Is there a question that I asked that you are unclear 22 about what I was asking?

23 A. I believe so.

24 Q. So a few questions ago I asked the question: When you 25 were negotiating the Settlement Agreement with Michael Cohen, Page 1788

1 did you have an understanding of who was ultimately going to be 2 responsible for paying Ms. Daniels. Is that the question that
3 you wanted to be read back?

4 A. Yes. 5 Q. That one, you could answer that, there is no 6 objection.

7 How would you answer that?

8 A. I find that question confusing.

9 Q. Sorry. Let me see if I could clarify.

10 Who were you negotiating with -- withdrawn. 11 Is your problem my use of the word "negotiating;" is 13 A. No.

14 Q. When you were dealing with Michael Cohen -- 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. -- did you have an understanding of how this deal was 17 going to be funded?

18 MR. BOVE: Objection.

19 THE COURT: Overruled. 20 A. I had an assumption. 21 MR. BOVE: Objection. 22 Move to strike.

23 THE COURT: Sustained.

24 Q. Did Michael Cohen say anything to you during the 25 negotiations that led you to believe that there was someone 12 that a big problem?

Page 1789 1 other than Michael Cohen who was funding this transaction?

2 MR. BOVE: Objection.

3 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 Q. What pauses your uncertainty on this? 5 MR. BOVE: Objection. 6 THE COURT: Sustained.

7 Q. A few moments ago we saw a text in which you and Dylan 8 Howard were discussing the fact that you perceived Mr. Trump as 9 being frugal?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Do you remember giving that answer?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. What about Mr. Trump's frugality is relevant to this 14 exchange that you were having with Mr. Dylan Howard? 15 A. It was my understanding that Mr. Trump was the 16 beneficiary of this contract and that in the overwhelming 17 majority of cases the beneficiary of the contract is the one who 18 funds it.

19 MR. BOVE: Objection. 20 Move to strike the last part. 21 THE COURT: Sustained. 22 The answer is stricken.

23 Q. So what did you an attribute the lack of funding of the 24 deal at this point? 25 A. Frugality.

Page 1790 1 Q. Whose frugality?

2 MR. BOVE: Objection.

3 May I be heard at sidebar?

4 THE COURT: Yes, please approach. 5 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:) 6 MR. BOVE: Thank you for hearing me, Judge.

7 My objection is that we've now endeavored to 8 attack this several different ways. Each of them has 9 been inadmissible.

10 We're now in a place where this is asked and 11 answered several times over, and I think that the 12 Government should be required to move on from here.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: It actually hasn't been answered.

14 It has been asked. It has been sustained every which way. 15 I believe the last way is a way that might not be 16 objectionable. 17 THE COURT: I agree with, Mr. Bove. It's time to 18 move on.

19 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay. 20 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in 21 open court:) 22 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
23 BY MR. STEINGLASS:
24 Q. Going back to Page 11. I am going to blow up some 25 texts in the interim between 507 and 512. This is again Page 1791 1 People's 176 in evidence.

2 Did these texts -- actually, can we get the few texts 3 that happened right before it as well, please.

4 So at the top of the page, second down, we see the line 5 you have already told us, "Because Trump is tight;" is that 6 right, from Dylan?

7 A. Talking with Dylan, yes.

8 Q. You said, "Yep;" is that right?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. What does Dylan say? 11 A. "I reckon that Trump impersonator I hired has more 12 cash."
13 Q. What did you interpret that to mean?

14 A. Yeah. 15 Q. What did you interpret that to mean? 16 A. That Trump wasn't as wealthy as he stated. 17 Q. And what is -- what is the relevance of that 18 observation?

19 A. I think that was a followup to Dylan's text where he 20 says, "Trump is tight." 21 Q. So, moving on, do you see a few lines down. 22 MR. STEINGLASS: I am going to ask you, please, to 23 blow up lines 513 to 519.

24 (Displayed.) 25 Q. And what do we see here? What date is this? Who is Page 1792 1 talking?

2 A. I can't read the exhibit.

3 Q. We will blow it back up for you in a second.

4 A. From the top? 5 Q. Yes. 6 A. This is October 25, 2016, from Dylan Howard: "Going to 7 see Pecker in 15. Will ask for an update. Any word?"
8 Q. And did you respond to that?

9 A. "Yes."
10 Q. And what did you say? 11 A. "I'm awaiting a call any second."
12 Q. Who were you awaiting a call from, if you remember?

13 A. I don't remember.

14 Q. What did you understand Dylan Howard to mean when he 15 said, "Going to see Pecker in 15, will ask for an update?" 16 A. I think Dylan or AMI was attempting to resurrect the 17 Stormy Daniels deal.

18 Q. Okay.

19 How did Dylan Howard respond? 20 A. The third text down? 21 Q. Yes. 22 A. "Okay."
23 Q. Did he send another text?

24 A. Yes. 25 Q. And what is the next text?

Page 1793 1 Is this still on October 25th?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. What did he say?

4 A. "It's like he is telling me what he wrote to someone 5 else." 6 Q. Maybe if you could read the text first, then I will ask 7 you how you interpret it.

8 A. I wrote: "Keep calling you urgently. Period. We have 9 to coordinate something on the matter he is calling you about, 10 or it could look awful for everyone." 11 Q. You started to tell us what you understood this to 12 mean?

13 A. Yes. I think that this, he is forwarding me a text 14 that he wrote to Michael Cohen. 15 Q. Were you, in fact, trying to reach Michael Cohen 16 yourself at this point? 17 A. I don't believe so.

18 Q. I'm going to privately show you what's been marked for 19 identification as People's Exhibit 337. 21 testimony. 22 THE COURT: No speaking objections.

23 MR. STEINGLASS: This is just for the witness, the 24 parties, and the court. 25 Q. Do you recognize this document?

20 MR. BOVE: Same objection with the Grand Jury Page 1794 1 MR. BOVE: Objection, Judge.

2 THE COURT: Sustained.

3 The objection is sustained.

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. What is that text?

8 A. "Push for the cash. D.P. and I told him he has to pay 9 the $150."
10 Q. What did you understand that to mean? 11 A. That in the context of what is on the screen there was 12 an attempt to resurrect this deal that had once fallen apart.

13 That AMI had divested itself from the deal, but they were 14 encouraging Cohen to deal directly with me, and that I should 15 try to get as much as I could, up to $150,000. 16 Q. And who did you understand "D.P." to be a reference to? 17 A. David Pecker.

18 Q. So when you say "resurrect the deal," the deal between 19 whom? 20 A. Well, the Stormy Daniels deal, but the party on the 21 other side of the deal from Stormy had changed. It changed from 22 AMI to Cohen or his corporate entity.

23 Q. So when you said "resurrect the deal," are you speaking 24 that you interpreted this as resurrecting AMI's deal with Stormy 25 Daniels or resurrecting Michael Cohen and his entity's deal with 4 Q. So going back to People's 176A, after that last text, 5 does Dylan Howard send another text?

Page 1795 1 Stormy Daniels?

2 MR. BOVE: Objection.

3 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 Q. Which deal are you talking about resurrecting, which 5 deal are you interpreting this as a deal to resurrect? 6 A. The Stormy Daniels deal.

7 Q. But who is on the other side?

8 A. That is what had changed.

9 Q. It had changed from what to what?

10 A. From AMI to Cohen. 11 Q. Okay. And keep going, please.

12 What is the next?

13 A. The next text is from me to Dylan.

14 He says, "You said you're paying." 15 Q. So, he says, "You said you're paying?" 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. Who is meant by "he?"
18 A. Michael Cohen.

19 Q. So does this mean at some point during this text 20 exchange you had a conversation with Michael Cohen? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Can you tell us a little bit about that conversation, 23 whatever you remember?

24 A. Yes, it was very frustrating. The entire matter was 25 very frustrating that it was on again and off again. That there Page 1796

1 were delays in funding, cancellations, disengaging from the
2 client, reengaging with the client, Stormy and Gina.

3 Then Dylan sort of as a peacemaker, sort of brought me 8 Then when I call Cohen, he says: I'm not paying 9 anything, AMI is paying.

10 It was just one more snafu. 11 Q. How did you respond to Dylan Howard?

12 A. "I am sorry."
13 Q. You said you sent that text: "He says you're paying?"
14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Did you then send another text? 16 A. Yes. "Call whenever." 17 Q. Okay. I am now showing you People's 283 in evidence.

20 Q. I am going to ask you, what is this document? 21 A. This is now the fourth or fifth time I sent my wiring 22 instructions to Michael Cohen.

23 Q. And in this email, to which domain, email address did 24 you use for Michael Cohen? 25 A. Gmail.com.

18 MR. STEINGLASS: Maybe load that top portion up.

19 (Displayed.)
4 back into the fold. He said he reached out to Pecker, and that 5 everything was teed up. 6 And then Dylan tells me: Push for the cash. And then 7 basically tells me to call Cohen.

Page 1797 1 Q. And what was the subject line?

2 A. "Wiring instructions."
3 Q. And the date of this email?

4 A. October 26, 2016. 5 This is now October 26, 2016. 6 Q. Thank you.

7 What does the body of the email say?

8 A. There is no body of the email.

9 Q. Is there an attachment?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. What is the attachment?

12 A. My wiring instructions.

14 exhibit.

13 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we see Page 2 in this 15 (Displayed.) 16 Q. Is this, Page 2, is this the wiring instructions to 17 wire money to your attorney/client trust account?

18 A. Yes.

19 Q. What made you resend these instructions? 20 A. Cohen's repeated assertion that he didn't have my 21 wiring instructions despite the fact they were repeatedly sent 22 to him previously.
