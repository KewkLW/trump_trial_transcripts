 Senior Court Reporter 2780 2781 1 THE CLERK: This is the People of the State of 2 New York against Donald J. Trump. Indictment 71543/23.

3 Appearances, starting with the People. 4 MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua 21 I asked Ms. Necheles this morning if she was 22 planning to elicit a question about a prior arrest. She 23 said she was. 24 We move to preclude that. 25 The case never proceeded and was dismissed 10 THE COURT: Good morning.

11 Good morning, Mr. Trump. 12 MS. HOFFINGER: Just a short application.

13 THE COURT: Sure. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: I conferred with Ms. Necheles 15 this morning.

16 Among the Defense Exhibits are J-26. Marked as 17 J-26 is an arrest record for Ms. Daniels from back in 18 2009. It's an allegation, according to the document, of 19 simple battery, with absolutely no injury, regarding her 20 former husband with whom she's divorced.

5 Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Matthew 6 Colangelo, Christopher Conroy, and Katherine Ellis. 7 MS. NECHELES: For the defense, Susan Necheles, 8 seated here with President Trump is here, Todd Blanche, 9 Emil Bove, and Gedalia Stern.

2782 1 without prosecution.

2 MS. NECHELES: I wasn't intending to try to put 3 the record in evidence. 4 I was just going to ask about whether she was 5 arrested. 6 THE COURT: As I say all the time, anybody can be 7 arrested. Any one of us can be arrested when we step 8 outside. That doesn't prove a thing. 9 If it resulted in nothing, you're precluded from 10 going into it. 11 MS. NECHELES: I'm going to ask, instead, if her 12 then-husband accused her of that. 13 I won't say anything about being arrested, just 14 accusing her.

15 MS. HOFFINGER: Anybody can be accused of 16 anything.

17 It has nothing to do with credibility. 18 It was as a result of a divorce proceeding. 19 THE COURT: If it wasn't a result of a conviction 20 or a fine or sentence, no; it's not probative of anything. 21 Anything else we need to go into before we get 22 the witness back on the stand? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: No, your Honor. 24 THE COURT: One thing.

25 I asked on Tuesday if you wanted to submit a 2783 1 request for a limiting instruction, what do you want me to 2 say on that. 3 (Whereupon, defense counsel confer.) 4 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I think that, given 5 the cross, I'm not sure -- it depends where we end at the 6 end of the testimony.

19 Jury entering.

20 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors 21 are present and properly seated.)
22 THE CLERK: Do both parties confirm that all 23 parties are present and properly seated? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes.

25 THE COURT: Good morning, jurors.

8 THE COURT: Yes. 9 I agree.

10 Let's get the witness back. 11 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

12 (Whereupon, the witness, Stormy Daniels, having 13 been previously duly sworn and/or affirmed, resumes the 14 witness stand and testifies as follows:)
15 THE COURT: Good morning, Ms. Daniels. 16 I remind you, you're still under oath.

17 Let's get the jury, please. 18 COURT OFFICER: All rise.

7 Can it wait until then?

2784 1 Welcome back.

2 Ms. Necheles. 3 MS. NECHELES: Thank you, your Honor. 4 CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION
5 BY MS. NECHELES:
10 Q You recall that President Trump was elected President 11 in November of 2016; right?

12 A Correct.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. 19 Q Well, do you recall that?

20 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 21 THE COURT: Sustained.

22 Q And -- but, in 2016, you were trying to sell your 23 story; right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q We were reviewing People's Exhibit 171-A.

17 Mischaracterization.

16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

13 Q And in 2011, you had given an interview with E! Online 14 where you had said your story about having sex with President 15 Trump was "bullshit"; right?

9 A Yes.

6 Q Ms. Daniels, when we ended the day on Wednesday -- or, 7 Tuesday, we were talking about what occurred prior to the 2016 8 election; correct?

2785 1 MS. NECHELES: If we could pull that up and put 2 that up again. 3 We can turn to Page 2.

5 evidence.

4 That can be shown to everybody. That's in 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MS. NECHELES: If we can blow up the part 8 starting with: "I have her."; "Is she ready to talk?" 9 Blow up the four from the bottom.

10 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 11 Q You see that in this part, you say that Gina Rodriguez 12 was saying -- you know, was asking whether you were ready to 13 talk; right? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

15 THE COURT: Please approach. 16 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 17 at sidebar:)
18 MS. HOFFINGER: Two things. 19 One. This has been fully gone through last time.

20 She can go through it again, but it's exactly the same. 21 Second. She didn't say anything. These are not 22 her texts. 23 Ms. Necheles had her read the Gina Rodriguez 24 texts to Dylan Howard.

25 I guess if she wants her to read them again --
2786 13 THE COURT: The objection is sustained. 14 Q At this point, you were asking for money; you wanted 15 money from President Trump; right?

17 Q You weren't asking for money in 2016?

18 A I never asked for money from President Trump. 19 Q You asked it from Michael Cohen; right? 20 A No. 21 Q Well, you wanted to make money from selling your 22 story; right?

23 A I never asked for money from anyone in particular. 24 I asked for money to tell my story. 25 Q And that's what you're asking in 2016, was for money 3 MS. NECHELES: I am not mischaracterizing. 4 I was in the middle of this. 5 I have three minutes, and then I'm done. 6 THE COURT: One thing about this. I gave you 7 latitude on Tuesday. You can ask her if she's aware of 8 some of this, but you can't do it in such a way that 9 you're putting their words in her mouth.

10 MS. NECHELES: Okay. 11 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 12 in open court:)
16 A No.

2 She's mischaracterizing.

1 that's not her testimony.

2787 1 to be able to tell your story; right?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Asked and answered. 3 THE COURT: Overruled. 4 You can answer. You can answer.

5 A I was asking to sell my story to publications to get 6 the truth out.

7 Q But, you entered into a negotiation over a 8 Non-Disclosure Agreement; right? 9 A My attorneys did, yes.

10 Q And that was your choice; right? 11 A (No response).

12 Q Well, you made the decision that you wanted your 13 lawyers to do that; right? 14 A I accepted an offer.

15 Q That was your choice; right? 16 A Not necessarily.

17 I wanted to do a press conference.

18 Q You would prefer to do the press conference and get no 19 money over making money; is that what you're saying?

20 A Absolutely, if it got the story out. 21 Q So, why didn't you do that?

22 A Because we were running out of time. 23 Q You were "running out of time" to get money; right? 24 A No. To get the story out.

25 Q You could have gone out any day of the week, could 2788 1 have walked out of your apartment, out of your ranch home and 2 given a press conference; right? 3 A I could have. 4 Q But, you chose not to; right?

5 A I chose to be safe. 6 Q You chose to make money; right?

7 A (No response). 8 Q Right? 9 A I chose to take the Non-Disclosure.

10 Q And, do you recall that in 2016, that at the same time 11 that your lawyer was negotiating with Michael Cohen over a 13 reporter from Slate named Jacob Weisberg? Do you recall that? 14 A I recall talking to someone from Slate. I'm not sure 15 the name. 16 Q And, Slate, am I correct, is a website that runs 17 stories; right?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And, you told Weisberg about your supposed affair with 20 President Trump; right? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And, you told him about the fact that you were 23 negotiating with Michael Cohen for a Non-Disclosure Agreement; 24 right?

25 A Yes.

12 Non-Disclosure Agreement, you were also speaking with a 2789 1 Q And Weisberg tried to convince you to let him publish 2 the story; right? 3 A No. 4 Um, let me see, he was my backup in case the Non-Disclosure 5 fell through, not enough time. 6 Q He wanted to publish your story; right?

7 A Everyone wanted to publish the story. 8 Q But, you stopped talking to him when you got the 9 money.

11 A I stopped talking to numerous people because I signed 12 a Non-Disclosure, and that was part of the deal. 13 Q You could have just let Weisberg publish the story, 14 but you wanted money from Weisberg; right?

15 A I could have had anybody publish the story. 16 Q But, they weren't willing to give you money; right?

17 A No.

18 Q Am I correct, you told Weisberg you were sharing these 19 details because you were afraid that Michael Cohen was stalling 20 on filing the Non-Disclosure Agreement and, after the election, 21 he wouldn't pay you; right?

22 A Yes. 23 Q You said that as an alternative to be paid for your 24 silence, you wanted to be paid for your story; right?

25 A I don't remember.

10 You wanted money from him; right?

2790 1 Can you show me where I said that?

2 Q Sure. 3 MS. NECHELES: Can we pull up J-45 for the 4 witness and the parties, please, and turn to Page 4.

6 and the parties' screens.)
19 A I'm sorry. What was that?

20 Q Isn't it correct that you told Weisberg that as an 21 alternative to being paid for your silence, you wanted to be 22 paid for your story; right? 23 A I don't remember saying that exactly, no. 24 Q Well, did you tell him that you wanted "something to 25 show" for your experience?

7 MS. NECHELES: We can turn to Page 3 and the 8 second paragraph. 9 You can blow that up for the witness.

10 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 11 and the parties' screens.)
12 Q Isn't it correct that you told Weisberg that as an 13 alternative to be paid for your silence, you wanted to be paid 14 for your story; right?

15 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 16 her screen.)
17 A (No response).

18 Q Is that correct?

5 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 2791 1 A Yes.

2 I wanted the truth to be printed, with a paper trail of 3 some sort, whether it was an interview, a video, or money, that 4 I was telling the truth, to protect me.

5 Q You wanted money; right? 6 A I wanted the truth to come out.

7 Q Well, are you saying you didn't tell Weisberg that as 10 A I don't remember saying that. I just told you that. 11 Q Isn't it correct that Weisberg told you that Slate did 12 not pay their sources, but he encouraged you to come forward 13 anyway? 14 A Yes.

15 Q But, you didn't go forward with him; right? 16 A Because I was offered the NDA.

17 Q Even though you would have gotten your story out, you 18 chose not to go with Slate? 19 A Correct. This was a better alternative.

20 Q The "better alternative" was for you to make money; 22 A The better alternative was to get my story protected 23 with a paper trail, so my family didn't get hurt if the story 24 was out.

25 Q And the story -- the paper trail was out if the story 8 an alternative to being paid for your silence, you wanted to be 9 paid for the story?

21 right?

2792 1 had gotten out?

2 A Can you repeat that? 3 Q And the paper trail was out if the story had gotten 4 out?

5 A Correct. With a target on my back and my family's. 6 It was the perfect solution.

7 Q Am I correct, you told Weisberg another one of your 8 motives was your anger about Trump's opposition to abortion and 11 Q You don't remember saying that to him?

12 A I don't remember saying that. Bullshit. 13 Q I want to direct your attention again to J-45 and -- 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

15 Q -- and Paragraph 2. 16 THE COURT: There's an objection.

17 Overruled for now.

18 MS. NECHELES: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the 19 objection.

20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 21 and the parties' screens.)
22 Q Directing your attention to Paragraph 2. 23 Isn't it correct, you told him another motivation to go 24 public was your anger about Trump's newfound opposition to 25 abortion and gay marriage?

10 A No.

9 gay marriage?

1 A I don't remember saying that.

2 Was he opposed to abortion? I don't know. 3 Q Isn't it true that what you were telling Weisberg was 4 you either wanted money or you were gonna hurt him politically?

5 A No.

8 politically by telling this story if he didn't give you money; 9 right?

10 A False. 11 Q And when Michael Cohen was --
12 MS. NECHELES: We can take that down. 13 Thank you. 14 Q -- was not paying you the money he promised to pay 15 you, you were furious; weren't you? 16 A Yes.

17 Q And didn't you scream at your lawyer, Keith Davidson, 18 and call him a "pussy" and tell him, "You better get money 19 before the election. Otherwise," you "would lose all" your 20 "leverage and" your "story would be worth zero;" you told him 21 that; didn't you?

22 A Can you show me where I said that? 23 MS. NECHELES: If we could play what is in 24 evidence as Defendant's Exhibit F-17 interview, and if you 25 could put up the transcript at the same time, F-17-AT.

2793 6 Q Because that's what you thought, wasn't it; you were 7 threatening that you would try to hurt President Trump 2794 6 court.)
7 MS. NECHELES: Sorry. That was a mistake. 8 THE COURT: It's all right. 9 (Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open 10 court.) 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I'm going to object.

12 THE COURT: Sustained. 13 Please stop the tape. 14 Please approach.

15 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 16 at sidebar:)
17 MS. HOFFINGER: This has nothing to do with the 18 question that Ms. Necheles asked. This has no mention of 19 the witness.

20 She's just replaying a tape of a conversation 21 between Michael Cohen --
22 MS. NECHELES: I have to look at the transcript. 23 I thought this is the one where she's talking 24 about -- that she's screaming at him.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Nope.

1 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
2 MS. NECHELES: You can blow up the transcript a 3 little bit. 4 Thank you.

5 (Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open 2795 1 THE COURT: I wanted to say on Tuesday, you guys 2 need to be careful when you put stuff up. Make sure what 3 you're putting up is what you mean to put up. 4 I don't want any mistakes. 7 There's one where she's calling him a "pussy". 8 THE COURT: See if you can find it. 9 MS. NECHELES: I will.

11 in open court:)
12 MS. NECHELES: I apologize. I put up the wrong 13 tape. 14 F-17-E.

15 THE COURT: Can we look at the transcript first, 16 before you play the tape?

17 MS. NECHELES: Yes.

18 Can you put up the transcript first, please. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20 THE COURT: That's the one we're looking for? 21 MS. NECHELES: Yes. That's it.

22 If you could play that, please. 23 (Whereupon, an audio exhibit is played in open 24 court.)
25 Q Do you recall that that's what you were saying --
10 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 5 MS. NECHELES: I thought this was the transcript. 6 I apologize.

2796 1 that's Keith Davidson, that's your lawyer that you heard on the 2 phone right now; right? 3 A Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen; correct? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

5 It doesn't refresh her recollection. 6 She said she didn't recall.

8 Q Do you recall now that you made those statements?

14 Sounds like a threat from Keith Davidson.

15 Q So, if Keith Davidson said that, he was lying? 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Q But, you got $130,000; right? 19 A I didn't.

20 That was the payment. 21 Q That was the payment that --
22 A I got a portion of it. 23 Q -- that was negotiated on your behalf; right? 24 A Correct.

25 Q And, in return for that $130,000, you signed an 9 A No, I do not, actually. It reminds me I never -- I
10 never yelled at Keith Davidson on the phone. 11 This specifically says that Gina's boyfriend was gonna go 12 out and tell a story, not that I was gonna do this, because I 13 didn't do this.

7 THE COURT: Sustained.

2797 1 Agreement that you would not tell your story publicly; right?

2 A Yes. 3 MS. NECHELES: I want to put up on the screen 4 People's Exhibit 276, which is the Settlement Agreement.

5 You can show that to all. It's in evidence.

13 A (No response). 14 Q Do you recall saying that?

15 A Yes. It's a contract. 16 Q And you understand that a contract is a legal 17 agreement; right?

18 A Well, I'm not an attorney, but yes. 19 Q And it was called a Confidential Settlement Agreement 20 and Mutual Release; Assignment of Copyright and 21 Non-Disparagement Agreement; right?

22 A That's what it says, yes. 23 Q And if we look in the first paragraph -- 24 MS. NECHELES: If we could blow up the first 25 paragraph, please.

7 MS. NECHELES: If we could blow up the top, the 8 heading of it, please. 9 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)

2 Q This paragraph talks about who -- that there is a 3 Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release between two parties 4 whose names are acknowledged in a Side Agreement; right?

5 A Yes.

13 A Yes. 14 Q And it said that: "Prior to entering into this 15 Agreement," you "had come into possession of some confidential 16 information;" right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And that it related to the other party, the defendant 19 to this Agreement; right?

20 A Yes. 21 MS. NECHELES: We can go to the next paragraph.

22 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q And you had claimed that you had been damaged; the 24 other party, the defendant, claimed that he had been damaged; 25 and you were going to have Released Claims; right?

7 paragraph, please.

6 MS. NECHELES: If we can look at the second 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 9 Q It says: "Recitals."
10 These are the things that are then being agreed to by the 11 parties about the facts; right?

12 Do you understand that?

2799 1 A Like I said, I am not an attorney, so I am reading 2 this quickly and -- I signed this based upon what my attorney 3 suggested that I do. 4 Q Okay.

5 But, you read it; didn't you? 6 A Yeah.

13 A "Any property and property rights" -- yes. 14 MS. NECHELES: We can go to the next paragraph.

15 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 16 Q And this is saying that you are -- the parties are 17 agreeing that this will be kept confidential thereafter; right?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Because this was a Confidentiality Agreement; right?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And, you had referred to it as an "NDA" or a 22 "Non-Disclosure Agreement"; right? 23 A Yes. 24 MS. NECHELES: We can go to the next paragraph.

25 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MS. NECHELES: We can go to the next paragraph. 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 9 Q And this is talking about that you guys were agreeing 10 to sell or transfer those rights; right? 11 (Whereupon, the witness reads the exhibit on her 12 screen.)
1 Q And this said that the parties want to avoid the 2800 2 expense of a litigation, and so you were settling any disputes 3 between yourselves; right? 4 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 7 Q And you were releasing any claims against each other; 20 right?

22 Q And the contract went on for many, many pages; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And what you've been saying here is you're not a 8 right? 9 A Yes.

10 MS. NECHELES: We can go to the next paragraph. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q It said that all the things that had been said here 13 are "integral", they're an important part of this Agreement; 14 right?

15 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on 16 her screen.)
17 A I'm not exactly sure what it means. But...(shrugs).

18 Q Okay. 19 So, these were some of the provisions in this contract; 21 A Yes.

25 lawyer, and these were legal terms, and you didn't understand 5 her screen.) 6 A Yes.

2801 1 or you don't feel that you're able to discuss all these legal 2 terms; right? 3 A Not without speaking to an attorney, no. 4 Q And lawyers negotiated this document; right?

5 A Yes.

21 Q January 12th.

22 Sorry. 23 But, you knew about that article that was coming out 24 before; didn't you?

25 A Keith Davidson said that something was coming out.

6 Q Your lawyer you had negotiated it, and Michael Cohen 7 negotiated; right? 8 A That's what I was led to believe. 9 Q Because you understood that this was a legal matter 10 that was being settled and a legal contract; right? 11 A (Pause). Yes. Fine. Okay.

12 Q So, now, on January 10, 2018, The Wall Street Journal 13 published an article that talked about this Settlement 14 Agreement; right?

15 A I need to make sure that was the date, but yes. In 16 January of '18. I'm not sure of the exact date.

17 MS. NECHELES: Can we pull up P1-A1 in evidence 18 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 19 Q See the date there?

20 A It says January 12th.

2802 1 Q All right.

2 Am I correct that on January 10, 2018, you signed a 3 statement saying you had not had sex with President Trump; 4 right?

5 A Yes. 6 MS. NECHELES: If we could put up People's 277.

7 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 8 Q This was that statement; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And you state in there -- that was on January 10, 11 2018, you put up that statement; right?

12 A That's the day they sent it to me, yes. 13 Q Well, you signed it. 14 That's your signature on it; right?

15 A I don't remember what day I signed it, but that's the 16 day they sent it to me.

17 Q Okay.

18 But, that is your signature; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q You state in there: "I recently became aware that 21 certain news outlets are alleging that I had a sexual and/or 22 romantic affair with Donald Trump many, many years ago" -- 23 because it was many, many, many years ago; right? 24 A At this time, it was 12 years.

25 Q That's many, many, many years before; right?

2803 1 A A lot of manys, but okay.

2 Q Then you go on: "I am stating with complete clarity 3 that this is absolutely false." 4 Right; this is what you wrote in there?

5 A Yes. 6 Q "My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few 7 public appearances and nothing more." 9 A Yes.

10 Q "When I met Donald Trump, he was gracious, 11 professional, and a complete gentleman to me and everyone in my 12 presence." 13 That's what you wrote; right? 14 A Well, to be clear, I did not write this.

15 Q You signed this statement; right? 16 A I signed it.

17 It was given to me, and I was told that I had to sign it.

18 Q Then you said: "Rumors that I have received hush money 19 from Donald Trump are completely false."
20 Correct; that's what you said? 21 A Correct. Because it was not a rumor. It was the truth.

22 Very different. 23 Q "If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald 24 Trump, trust me, you wouldn't be reading about it in the news, 25 you would be reading about it in my book. But the fact of the 8 Correct?

2804 1 matter is, these stories are not true."
2 And then you signed that document; correct? 3 A Yes. 8 A Michael Cohen released a statement, yes. 9 Q And you signed it; right?

10 A But, I didn't release it. 11 Q But, you signed it; right?

12 A Yes. 13 MS. NECHELES: If we could put up People's 278 in 14 evidence.

15 That could be shown to everybody. 16 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
17 Q On January 30th, again, you denied that you ever had a 18 sexual relationship with Donald Trump; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q You said: "Over the past few weeks I have been asked 21 countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual 22 relationship I had with Donald Trump many, many, many years 23 ago. 24 "The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged 25 affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017, and now 6 Q Am I correct that 21 days later, you put out another 7 statement like that? 4 MS. NECHELES: We can take that down.

5 Thank you.

2805 1 again in 2018. I am not denying this affair because I was paid 2 hush money as has been reported in overseas-owned tabloids. I 3 am denying this affair because it never happened. I will have 4 no further comment on this matter.

5 "Please feel free to check me out at Instagram at 6 TheStormyDaniels."
7 Right? 8 A That's what it says.

10 A Correct. 11 Q Am I correct that Michael Cohen had been pushing to 12 get you to sign this; right? That's what you're saying? 13 A Via Keith Davidson. 14 I never spoke to Michael Cohen directly.

15 Q But -- and you understood that in 2018, President 16 Trump was denying this relationship; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And he wanted you to deny it as well; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And he was not running for election at that point in 21 2018; was he?

22 A No. 23 Q There was no election in 2018; right? 24 A No.

25 Q He was already President; right?

9 Q That's what you signed; right?

1 A Yes.

2806 2 Q But he was concerned -- you understood he was 3 concerned about his family; right? 9 A I never mentioned anything about his family.

10 Q Okay. 11 But, there was nothing about an election going on then; 12 right?

13 A No. 14 Q And you understood, also, that President Trump has a 15 brand; right? 18 protecting his brand and his image; right? 19 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 20 THE COURT: Overruled. 21 You can answer.

22 A I wouldn't know what he wants to protect.

23 Q Well, you claimed that you had discussions about 24 business with Mr. Trump; right? 25 A Yes. And he never expressed concern about his brand.

4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 5 THE COURT: Overruled. 6 You can answer.

7 THE WITNESS: Can't?

8 THE COURT: You can.

16 A Yes.

17 Q And you understood that he is concerned about 2807 3 A He implied it. 4 Q And that's his brand; right? 5 A Yes. (Shrugs). 8 money for that Agreement, you then decided you wanted to 9 publicly say that you had sex with President Trump; right?

10 A No. Nobody would ever want to publicly say that. 11 I wanted to publicly defend myself after people attacking 12 me after Michael Cohen told about the story.

13 Q Well, you wanted to make more money; right? 14 A No. 15 That's why I did 60 Minutes for free. 16 Q Well, you hired Michael Avenatti to be your new 17 lawyer; right?

18 A Yes. (Facial gestures). 19 Q You then gave an interview to Anderson Cooper on 60 20 Minutes; right? 21 A I did.

22 Q That was televised in 2018; right?

23 A Yes. 24 Q In that interview, you told the world about what you 25 claimed had happened with President Trump; correct?

1 Q Didn't you claim, don't you tell a story that he 2 talked about creating an image that was successful?

6 Q So, even though you had agreed that you would not 7 discuss this supposed story, and you had received a lot of 2808 1 A Right.

2 And I was not compensated. 3 Q And you were not paid for that interview; right? 4 A Correct.

5 Q And you really want to keep saying that; right?

7 Q But, the interview generated a ton of publicity for 9 A Lots of bad publicity, yes.

10 Q A ton of publicity; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And your attorney, Michael Avenatti, hated Trump and 13 announced publicly that he wanted to run to be President of the 14 United States himself; right?

15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 16 THE COURT: Sustained.

17 Q Well, Michael Avenatti was helping you get all this 18 publicity; right? 19 A No.

20 Q Well, he didn't arrange for you to go on CNN? 21 A He arranged for me to go on CNN and The View.

22 Everything else he took for himself. 23 Q And you knew that getting a lot of free publicity for 24 your story would allow you to then make lots of more money off 25 of your story about President Trump; right?

6 A Yes.

8 you; didn't it?

1 A I actually didn't. I was completely unprepared for how 2 far that went. 3 Q Well, after giving the Anderson Cooper interview, you 4 were able to negotiate a book contract; right?

5 A Yes. 6 Q And it was for $800,000 right?

7 A Yes.

10 A I sold my life story, yes. 11 Q And that was in addition to the $130,000 that you had 12 been paid previously; right? 13 A I didn't receive 130, though. 14 Q You were paid, but you had to give some of it to Gina 15 Rodriguez and some of it to Keith Davidson; right? 16 A Okay. Yes.

17 Q Correct?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And so, now you had been paid $930,000, almost a 20 million dollars, for selling the story; right? 21 A I also didn't receive the 800,000.

22 Q Well, that's what you had contracted to -- agreed to 23 get paid; right? 24 A Minus commissions and what was stolen from me.

25 Q Okay.

8 Q So, now you were able to sell your story for $800,000; 9 right?

2809 2810 1 But, that's what you had sold your story for; right?

2 A Correct. 3 Q Am I correct that the centerpiece of your book is 4 about your story about, supposedly, having sex with President 5 Trump? 6 A No.

7 Q Well, you believed that was the reason people would 8 buy your book, was to read about your description about sex 9 with Donald Trump; didn't you?

10 A Sadly, I thought that's what a lot of people would 11 turn to first.

12 Luckily, the start of -- for me, the start of my story 13 started when I was two-years-old. 14 Q Chapter 3 started with a joke about whether the reader 15 skips right there and started with the chapter about President 16 Trump; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q That's because that's what you believed people were 19 gonna do, that they would buy the book just for that story?

20 A I don't know. Sad. 21 Q Well, that's your book; you wrote it?

22 A I did write it. 23 Q And after you wrote the book, you capitalized even 24 more on the story you were selling by doing a strip club tour 25 called The Make America Horny Tour?

2811 1 A I did not name that tour, and I fought it tooth and 2 nail. 3 Q That was the tour you went on. 4 You spent a couple of years doing that?

5 A It was a job I had already been doing. Most of those 6 clubs I did four or five times before that. Several of those 7 clubs were in place before the book. 8 Q But, it was named The Make America Horny Tour? 9 A That's what the publicist called it.

10 MS. NECHELES: Can we show J-15? 11 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Am I talking too fast?

12 THE COURT REPORTER: It would be nice if you 13 slowed down a bit. 14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 15 and the parties' screens.) 16 Q That was for your tour?

17 A Yes.

18 MS. NECHELES: Can we admit it? 19 THE COURT: J-15 is admitted in evidence.

21 evidence.)
22 MS. NECHELES: We can show that. 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 Q You advertised your tour with a picture of you and 25 President Trump together from the golf tournament?

20 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-15 is received in 2812 1 A False.

2 I have no choice how the club advertises, and I never 3 posted this. 4 Q You did post The Make America Horny Tour?

5 A I never used that tagline. I hated it.

9 Q And you traveled throughout America on this Make 10 America Horny Tour; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And you were selling yourself to people who hated 13 President Trump as someone who get could President Trump 14 indicted; right?

15 A I was not selling myself to anyone. 16 I was performing at clubs, and whoever wanted to pay 17 admission. It was not geared towards people only allowed in who 18 hated somebody. These were strip club patrons who had seen me 19 dance. They were fans of my work. A lot of the people I knew 20 from ten years before. 21 Q Am I correct that you said your fan base was 22 completely different, and that the middle-aged white men who 23 used to populate your show and buy your movies were gone, and 24 in their place were now the so-called resistance, women, gay 25 couples, immigrants, and other social liberals who despised 6 Q You continued this strip tour in 2018 and 2019; right?

7 A Yes. I continued doing my job, dancing at clubs, which 8 I've done through 2001.

2813 1 Trump. You said it's pretty much these types of women and it 2 was angry. 3 Do you recall saying that? 4 A I did.

5 The climate in the club certainly changed. 6 I was not selling myself to a certain demographic. I was 7 certainly going on stage and doing my -- the shows I had done 8 since I was 21-years-old. 9 Q But, now you had a new fan base and were able to get 10 your shows sold? 11 A I was just doing the same job I always did.

12 Q You also got a job on a reality show called The 13 Surreal Life? 14 A Yes.

15 Q You promoted interviews on the show, saying you were 16 doing the show so you could tell your "whole story"; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q When you said your "story", that was, supposedly, the 19 story of you having sex with Donald Trump?

22 Q When you did that and were promoting your story, you 23 say: "Then I get to tell the story from our side, without 24 editors or posing or stripping. That was the reason I wrote the 25 book Full Disclosure. People still ask me questions that were 20 A It was the full story of my life and what I have been 21 through through all of this.

2814 1 in the book. I learned America doesn't read, so you have to put 2 it on reality TV." 3 That was the story you wanted to tell; right? 4 A Yes. 8 Q And you have Tweeted you made a million dollars 9 between the book deal and The Surreal Life; right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q You made 200,000 from just appearing on The Surreal 12 Life; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And you also participated in making an NBC documentary 15 about yourself, which aired on television just recently; right?

19 A Yes.

20 Q In order to get you to cooperate with that 21 documentary, the documentary writers paid you for the rights 22 to your book deal; right? 23 A They didn't have "to get" me "to cooperate". 24 I initially started filming myself.

25 Q And then you gave that over, the filming -- you were 16 A Yes.

17 Q And that involved several years of filming and 18 interviews of you; right?

7 A It was my entire life story.

5 Q And the story, principally, in Full Disclosure was 6 your story about having sex with Donald Trump; right?

2815 1 having an affair with the guy who was filming you; right?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Overruled. 4 You can answer.

5 A I was having -- there was 17 people who shot footage 6 of that; including, one of them is my husband.

7 Q And you started having an affair when you were filming 11 Q You were married to someone else at the time?

12 A I was separated from my husband. 13 Q And you were, in fact, paid $125,000 by the 14 documentary people; right?

15 A No, I was not. 16 Q Well, you didn't receive $125,000 for the rights to 17 your book?

18 A Nope. Not yet. 19 Q You've been promised that, you're saying?

20 A I'm sorry. What was that? 21 Q You're saying you were promised that, but you haven't 22 received all the money? 23 A I haven't received all the payments, no. 24 Q Okay.

25 How much of it have you received?

9 A There was one of the cameramen, we started dating, and 10 he stopped filming as soon as we started dating.

8 it; right?

2816 1 A They gave me a hundred thousand dollars for back 2 footage, but I was not paid for an interview. 3 Q But, you were paid for the rights to your book; right? 4 A That was part of my contract.

5 You have to ask my attorney, who's sitting there, who did 6 the deal.

7 Q Okay. 8 But, you received $120,000 from the documentary people; 9 right?

10 A A lot of it was footage that I had to reimburse 11 cameramen for.

12 Q So, the answer is yes? 13 A Not exactly. 14 You're trying to trick me into saying something that's not 15 entirely true. 16 Q You are still grossing over 125,000; right?

17 A Supposed to be.

18 Q Where did you deposit that money? 19 A Into my business account.

20 Q You have also been holding viewing parties at bars to 21 view the documentary; right?

22 A Yes. 23 Q And you've been selling tickets to that; right? 24 A Yes.

25 Q It's another way you're making money off the 2817 1 documentary and off of this story; right?

2 A Which I haven't actually made any profit. It covers my 3 travel, expenses, and security. No profit. 4 Q When you say covers your "travel" and "expenses",
5 you're traveling to go to those viewing parties; right? 6 A Yes.

7 It's all part of promotion for the film.

10 A I don't know. I don't speak for other people. 11 Q Well, haven't you said -- didn't you say: "People come 12 up and they're so emotional and put so much on me. They're 13 like, 'You're gonna save the world, you're a patriot, you're a 14 hero;'" right?

15 A You're misconstruing that quote from when I was in a 16 strip club people said that. That's not from a viewing party.

17 That documentary was actually very polarizing for people.

20 A I am quoting a lot of women who came up to me in 2018 21 while I was on stage.

22 Q But, you are continuing to this day to continue making 23 money to sell a story that you promised will put President 24 Trump in jail; right?

25 A No.

18 Q So, that is from a strip club that people would come 19 up and say, "You are a hero;" right?

8 Q And you have become a hero at those parties to 9 Trump-haters; right?

2818 1 Q Well, isn't it a fact that you keep posting on social 4 A Show me where I said I would be "instrumental in 5 putting President Trump in jail". 6 Q All right.

7 MS. NECHELES: If we could show the witness J-43, 8 please. Just for the witness and parties.

11 Q Do you recognize that as your post?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And -- 14 A And I don't see the word "instrumental" or "jail".

15 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I offer that in 16 evidence.

17 THE COURT: Any objections?

18 MS. HOFFINGER: No. 19 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

20 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-43 is received in 22 Q Just one month ago. 23 If we could read this. 24 MS. NECHELES: Blow it up a little bit more.

25 Q You were responding to the post, someone else's post 10 and the parties' screens.)
9 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 21 evidence and is shown on the screens.)
2 media how you're going to be instrumental in putting President 3 Trump in jail?

2819 1 there?

2 A Yes. Someone calling me a "human toilet". So I 3 capitalized on the joke. 4 Q The other post: "Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels 5 a/k/a the human toilet are their star witnesses." 6 Right?

7 A Yes. 8 Q You said: "Exactly. Making me the best person to 9 flush the orange turd down."
10 A Yes. 11 I don't see "instrumental" or "jail" there.

12 You're putting words in my mouth. 13 Q So, when you said you were "the best person to flush 14 the orange turd down", you weren't saying you were going to be 15 instrumental in causing him to be convicted of a crime; that 16 was not what you meant?

17 A No.

18 Q What does that mean? 19 A I am pretty sure this is hyperbole. If somebody calls 20 me a "toilet", I say I can "flush" somebody. 21 See how that works? (Gesturing). It goes around.

22 Q You said you were going to "flush" President Trump? 23 A I didn't say "President Trump". 24 It says "orange turd".

25 So, if that's what's interpreted by you...

2820 1 Q What do you mean?

2 A I don't know what I mean.

3 Q You have no idea -- 4 A I'm also not a toilet, so it's all... (gesturing). 5 Q I'm asking whether you knew what you meant when you 7 A Yes, I do.

8 Q What did you mean? 9 A I meant I'm not a "human toilet", so if they want to 10 make fun of me, I can make fun of them. 11 Q You don't want to admit you meant Mr. Trump?

12 A I absolutely meant Mr. Trump.

13 Q Why did you say no? 14 A It doesn't say "instrumental" and "putting him in 15 jail".

17 her answers, please.

18 THE COURT: Did you finish answering the 19 question? 20 A Can you ask your question again? 21 THE COURT: Can we have that read back?

22 (Whereupon, the requested portion was read back 23 by the court reporter.) 24 A So, what's the rest of the question? 25 I did answer it. 16 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we let the witness complete 6 said an "orange turd"?

2821 1 THE COURT: That was your whole answer? You 2 finished answering the question? 3 THE WITNESS: I believe so. 4 THE COURT: All right.

5 MS. NECHELES: If we could pull up for the 21 Q And then you're responding to that post below that; 22 right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Okay.

25 A I can't tell if there was something missing or not 8 the parties' screens.) 9 Q That's your post; correct?

10 A Yes. 11 MS. NECHELES: And we can turn to the next page.

12 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 13 and the parties' screens.) 14 Q That's also part of the same post; correct?

15 A I'm not sure. 16 Q Well, you see --
17 A Because it says that it was suspended.

18 Q Yes. 19 But, you see how your post is right above that?

20 A Yes.

6 witness J-43 -- J-44.

7 (Whereupon, an exhibit shown on the witness' and 2822 1 though, because it says "from a suspended account".

2 Q Okay. 3 It says "from a suspended account". 4 You understand, you can get old posts before it was 5 suspended on the internet? 6 A If somebody screenshots it.

7 Q Do you recognize that as something you responded to? 8 A I respond to hundreds of Tweets like this, calling me 9 names. Most -- most -- you know. I'm not sure.

10 Q Referring to the page before, you -- 11 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I offer that first 12 page in evidence. 13 MS. HOFFINGER: I object. 14 Can we approach?

15 A I just can't be sure. 16 THE COURT: Sure.

17 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 18 at sidebar:) 19 MS. HOFFINGER: What's happening here, 20 Ms. Necheles is putting in half pieces of these texts. 21 So -- sorry. Posts.

22 They are in response to, as she has just said, 23 threats from other people. 24 Here, she's not clear what she's responding to.

25 Previously, Ms. Necheles has done the same thing 2823 1 on Tuesday. She's put in half of the Tweet, without 2 putting in what she's responding to. 3 It's creating an impression with the jury.

18 THE COURT: The whole thing is her response and a 19 deleted post.

20 MS. NECHELES: But it shows up on the internet 21 from The Wayback Machine.

22 I can put it in on our case. 23 THE COURT: It still won't tell us what the post 24 was.

25 MS. NECHELES: It does.

7 she was responding to, she has responded to hundreds or 8 thousands of threatening Tweets. 9 MS. NECHELES: The other part stands on its own.

10 If you want, we'll call a witness on our direct 11 case and say this was --
12 THE COURT: That wouldn't get it in. 13 You want to get in a portion of her response, 14 without letting us know what she was responding to?

15 MS. NECHELES: I was trying to put the whole 16 thing in.

17 I have the whole thing there.

4 We have Ms. Daniels' testimony. She's not sure 5 exactly what she was responding to. 6 Given this scenario, whether it was an account 2824 1 Page 2 tells us the post she was responding to.

2 THE COURT: You can do that later. 3 MS. NECHELES: I'll do it on my case. 4 THE COURT: That's fine.

5 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held 6 in open court:)
7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 Q Ms. Daniels, when President Trump was indicted on this 9 case, you celebrated on Twitter by repeatedly Tweeting and 10 pushing merchandise that you were selling in your store; right? 11 A I Tweeted about his being indicted, yes.

12 And people wanted to ask how they could support me, so I 13 Tweeted the link to my store. 14 Q You have an online store where you sell merchandise; 15 right?

17 Q I want to show you what has been marked as J-22, 18 please. 19 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 20 and the parties' screens.) 21 Q You recognize that? That's -- the first page is a 22 Tweet by you? 23 A Yes. 24 MS. NECHELES: If you can put up the second page.

25 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 16 A Sure.

2825 1 and the parties' screens.)
2 A Yes. 3 Q That's a Tweet by you, as well? 4 A Yes.

5 MS. NECHELES: I offer those in evidence, your 6 Honor.

18 Right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q What you're saying is you're drinking champagne 21 because you're celebrating that President Trump was indicted; 22 right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Then you said: "Team Stormy merchandise, autograph 25 orders are pouring in too. Thank you for that as well. But 8 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 9 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-22 is received in 10 evidence.) 11 MS. NECHELES: If we can display, starting on 12 Page 1. 13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 14 Q Am I correct that in this first Tweet, you said:
15 "Thank you to everyone for your support and love! I have so 16 many messages coming in that I can't respond. Also, don't want 17 to spill my champagne."
7 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.

2826 1 allow a few extra days for shipment."
2 Correct? 3 A Yes. 4 Q This was on March 30th you said this; right?

5 A Yes. 6 Q That was you selling your merchandise; right?

7 A That is me doing my job. 8 Q Selling your merchandise; right?

17 gift."
18 Correct? 19 A Correct.

20 Q Again, you're celebrating the indictment by selling 21 things from your store; right?

22 A Not unlike Mr. Trump. 23 Q Pushing your stuff so that you could sell it; right? 24 A Absolutely.

25 I'm not allowed to sell anybody else's things.

9 A Which is part of my job, yes.

10 MS. NECHELES: Turn to the next page. 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 MS. NECHELES: Blow up the text first. 13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 14 Q You said: "New merchandise is now in the store. Yes, 15 photos and comics are autographed. In celebration of new 16 indictments, all orders in next 45 hours get a free surprise 2827 1 Q In fact --
2 MS. NECHELES: We can take that down. 3 Thank you. 4 Q You have an online store that has -- much of the 7 A I got President Trump indicted? 8 Q Well, aren't you bragging about that in your items 9 that you're selling?

10 A No. 11 Q I want to show you what has been marked as J-24.

14 Q That's an item that you sell in your store; is it not?

15 A Yes. 16 MS. NECHELES: I offer that in evidence, your 17 Honor.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 19 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

20 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-24 is received in 21 evidence and is shown on the screens.)
22 Q That's one of the items you sell in your store, 23 something called "Stormy, Saint of Indictments candle"; right? 24 A Yes.

25 That was made from a store in New Orleans.

12 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 13 and the parties' screens.)
5 merchandise is you bragging about how you got President Trump 6 indicted; right?

2828 1 Q You're saying that's not you bragging about how you 2 are the Saint of a person who got President Trump indicted? 3 A No. I'm not bragging. 4 I think it's funny that a store made those for me to sell, 5 so I put those on my site. 6 Q And you're making $40 on each of those; right?

15 Q You recognize that as another item you sell in your 16 store?

17 A Yes.

18 Q The next page, you recognize that as another item you 19 sell in your store?

20 A Yes. 21 MS. NECHELES: I offer all that in evidence.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 23 THE COURT: Accepted in evidence. 24 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J-24 is received in 25 evidence.)
8 Q You're also selling Team Stormy merchandise; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q I show you what has been marked J-24 -- I'm sorry. 11 MS. NECHELES: If we could turn to Page 2 of 12 that. 13 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness' 14 and the parties' screens.)
7 A No. I'm actually making about $7.

15 Q Well, you testified on direct examination that there 16 are two books you are working on right now; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And what are those books about? 19 A One is called "Rock Star Porn Star." It is about my 20 partner. He's a musician who became a porn star. 21 And the other one is a novel about a girl who grew up in 22 New Orleans. 23 It's nonfiction -- I'm sorry, it is fiction. 24 Q And did that person, that girl in the novel, have an 25 affair with a presidential candidate?

10 Q A large part of your livelihood, for a bunch of years 11 now, has been making money off the story that you had sex with 12 President Trump and that you will help President Trump be 13 convicted; right?

8 please. 9 Thank you.

2832 1 A No.

2 Q And do you plan to continue to make money off the 3 selling of your story? 4 A I plan to continue to do my job. And to fund my 5 extraordinary legal bills.

8 communicate with ghosts and dead people; right?

11 Q Well, my question was, are you making money by telling 12 people that you have the ability to communicate with ghosts and 14 A Well, I am making money -- well, I haven't made any 15 money yet, but the idea is to make money on a television show 16 about the paranormal and UFOs and the unexplained.

17 Q Well, you have made a show and podcast claiming that 18 you can speak to dead people; right? 19 A I have been on lots of podcasts.

20 Q Well, my question -- 21 A Which podcast are you referring to?

22 Q Are you saying you have not made a show or a podcast 23 telling people that you can speak to dead people? 24 A Yes, we are talking about the paranormal, yes.

25 Q And you also claimed that you lived in a house in 9 A I work on a television show called -- well, the title 10 had changed, but it used to be called Spooky Babes.

6 Q And there is another way you are making money now, 7 which is by telling people that you have the ability to 13 dead people?

2833 1 New Orleans that was haunted and that the spirits that are in 2 the house attacked your boyfriend and held him under water; 3 right? 4 A Yes, so the house was -- has some very unexplained 5 activity. 6 We brought in experts; people to measure the electromagnetic 7 fields, the religious experts, scientists, people to check for 8 gas leaks. 9 So, yeah, it was a lot of interesting and unexplained 10 activity, so I created a whole entire show. 11 A lot of -- 12 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor -- 13 A A lot of the activity was completely debunked as, you 14 know, a giant opossum that was under the house, for instance. 15 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, your Honor, I move to 16 strike all of that now and ask that the witness be 17 instructed to answer the question.

18 THE COURT: No. Overruled. 19 Q And so, my question was that you claimed that you lived 20 in a house in New Orleans that was haunted and that spirits 21 attacked your boyfriend; is that correct? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And then you say your boyfriend attacked you; right?

24 A Yes. 25 Q And isn't it a fact that you were the one who attacked
2834 1 your boyfriend?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Counselor, we discussed this. 5 MS. NECHELES: No, we did not, not about this, 6 your Honor. 7 THE COURT: Please move on. 8 MS. NECHELES: But, your Honor, this is not the 9 same thing.

10 THE COURT: Please move on. 11 Q And, shortly thereafter, your boyfriend moved out; 12 right? 13 A Define "shortly"? 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: Sustained. 16 Q Well, didn't your boyfriend question your sanity? 17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Sustained. 19 Q And you have been making money off of your claim that 20 you are a medium and that you can talk to the dead; right? 21 A I am making money doing -- I am part of a ghost-hunting 22 team that we go into locations, yeah. 23 Q And you read tarot cards for clients; correct? 24 A Yeah, a lot of my fans like to do things called High 25 Tea and Tarot with Stormy Daniels, and we read tarot cards 2835 1 together.

2 Q And you charge people for that; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you claim to be able to speak to people's dead 5 relatives; right? 6 A I make them agree that it's all entertainment; right. 7 Q And that's what you charge them for? 8 A Yes. 9 Q But, you claim -- you tell people that that's what you 10 can do, right, speak with their dead relatives; right? 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. Asked and answered. 12 THE COURT: Overruled. 13 You can answer. 14 A Yes. 15 Q And that's what you have made money off of; right? 16 A One of the ways, yes. 17 Q All right. So, now, before you started making a living 18 talking with dead people, and selling your story with -- about 19 President Trump, you were an actress, a porn actress; right? 20 A Yes. 21 Q And you have acted in porn movies, in 200 sex films; 22 right? 23 A Including comps -- compilations. 24 Q And you've also written and directed 150 sex films, you 25 said in your direct; is that correct?

1 A Give or take.

2 Q And so, this was your career for over 20 years: 3 Writing, acting, and directing sex films; right? 4 A Yes.

5 Q So, you have a lot of experience in making phony 6 stories about sex appear to be real; right?

7 A Wow. I'm a -- (Laughter.) That's not how I would put 8 it.

11 Q All right. But you're making fictionalized stories 12 about sex; you write those stories? 13 A No. The sex is real. The character names might be 14 different, but the sex is very real. That's why it's 15 pornography and that's a B movie. 16 Q Okay. But you testified on direct that these films 17 have plots; right?

18 A Some of them do, yes. 19 Q And the plots are fake; right?

20 A Some of them. Some of them are based on truth. 21 Q And they are movies; right?

22 A Of course. 23 Q And you've been writing those stories about sex; 24 right?

25 A Yes.

9 The sex in the films, it's very much real. Just like what 10 happened to me in that room.

2836 2837 1 Q And then you act them out; right?

2 A Sometimes. 3 Q And you have -- 4 A Sometimes I just direct. 5 Q And you have a lot of experience in memorizing these 6 fictional stories and repeating them; right? 7 A I have of experience in repeating stories and of 8 memorizing stories? I do a lot of that, but not just about sex, 9 I'm pretty sure we all can do that.

10 Q And you have bragged about how good you are about 11 writing porn movies and writing really good stories and writing 12 really good dialogue; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And now you have a story you have been telling about 15 having sex with President Trump; right? 16 A And if that story was untrue, I would have written it 17 to be a lot better. (Laughter.)
18 Q Because you are a good storywriter; right? 19 THE COURT: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. 20 Q Because you are a good storywriter; right? 21 A I'm a good screenwriter. 22 Q And that story was enough -- you made that real enough 23 sounding to make you millions of dollars; right? 24 A I didn't have to write this one. 25 Q But it has made you millions of dollars; right?

1 A No.

2838 2 Q So, you're saying now that you could have written a 3 better story and made more money? 4 A I'm saying I didn't make millions of dollars, and I
5 didn't write this story. 6 Q Well, you made over a million on your book and the 7 film, or The Surreal Life; right? 8 A Well, some money amassed, but that's not millions. 9 Q And you've also made money selling merchandise; right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And you have made money on your two-year tour of sex 12 clubs; right? 13 A I don't work in sex clubs. I work in strip clubs. So 14 that's a big difference.

15 Q You made money on your two-year tour working in strip 16 clubs; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And you made money from the documentary; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Okay. And when you prepared for your testimony with 21 the Prosecutor in this case, you had a number of meetings with 22 them; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And they told you that they wanted to -- you to 25 testify to lots of details so your story would sound credible; 2839 1 right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And do you recall that when you testified on direct 4 examination, you gave a whole description of what you say the 5 tile in President Trump's hotel suite looked like; right? 6 A Yes. 9 A Yes.

10 Q And then Ms. Hoffinger asked you: "Did you mention 11 anything about the floor?" 12 Do you recall her asking you that? 13 A I think so. 14 Q And you responded, "The black and white tile." 15 And she asked, "Did you mention that?" 16 Do you recall that? 17 A Yeah.

18 Q And that had been part of your prep, that you were 19 supposed to include certain details in your testimony; right? 20 A There is nothing wrong with preparing a witness. I 21 would hope that any attorney would do that. 22 Q Okay. That wasn't my question. 23 My question was -- 24 A About a tile. 25 Q That had been part of your prep, that you were supposed 7 Q And you included what you said the tile on the floor 8 looked like, and that it was black and white; right?

2840 1 to include certain details in your testimony; right?

2 A Truthful facts, yes. Don't forget the facts, that's 3 all I was ever told to do. 4 Q And those were details that matched what you wrote in 5 your book; right? 6 A I would have to see, but probably. 7 Q Well, you were prepped so that -- with the Prosecutor, 8 so that you would match -- you would try to match things to your 9 book so that you would look more credible; right?

10 A Well, I don't need to match things to my book because 13 Q And you know that there is no way to check on the 14 details of what you claim happened; right? 15 A No, I did not know that. 16 Q Well, this supposed sexual encounter that you testified 17 about supposedly occurred 18 years ago; right?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And so -- and it was just you, supposedly, and 20 President Trump in that hotel suite; right? 21 A And his bodyguard. 22 Q His bodyguard, you said, was outside the hotel suite; 23 right? 24 A With the doors open. And it was the same floor. 25 Q You said the doors were open a crack; right?

11 it's the same story. And my story hasn't changed when it comes 12 to those details.

2841 1 A And then I opened it. He walked in. And the same 2 thing when I exited. 3 Q Well, he didn't walk in; right? 4 A No. But he stood right there and watched me walk in. 5 Q And he was standing outside the doors; right? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And you said in your book that the suite took the 8 entire floor of the hotel? 9 A It's -- I don't know if it took the whole floor, but it 11 Q So you got on the elevator, and that was the only suite 12 there? 13 A It was right in front of me. 14 (Witness indicating with hands.) 15 Q Okay. And -- 17 Q All right. Now, in fact, your story about what 19 the years; hasn't it? 21 Q Well, let's talk about your story. 22 A (Laughter.) 23 Q You said you met President Trump at a celebrity golf 24 tournament in Lake Tahoe; right? 25 A Yes. 20 A No.

10 had its own elevator.

18 happened between you and President Trump has changed a lot over 16 A To be fair, I don't know what was behind me.

2842 1 Q And that tournament was called the American Century 2 Championship; right? 3 A I'm not sure. 4 Q And there were a lot of celebrities and sports figures 5 at that celebrity golf tournament; right? 6 A Yes. 7 Q Aaron Rogers? 8 A I don't know. 9 Q Dan Quail?

10 A I don't know. I can't remember. 11 Q Drew Brees? 12 A Who?

13 Q Drew Brees?

14 A Oh, I have no idea. 15 Q Charles Barkley?

22 Q And the company you worked for, Wicked Production, was 23 one of the sponsors of the golf tournament? 24 A Wicked Pictures. 25 Q And there was a golf gift room where there was swag 19 Q And there were many, many other celebrities there, too; 20 right?

16 A Yes. 17 Q Ben Roethlisberger?

18 A Yes. 21 A Yes.

2843 1 given out by various sponsors of the tournament?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And you and the other porn stars who were there 4 took photographs of yourself with a lot of the celebrities; 5 right? 6 A We didn't take the photos. The people who will worked 7 there did, yes. Yes -- but, yes. 8 Q The people who worked for Wicked Pictures were taking 9 photographs?

10 A And for the golf tournament, yeah. 11 Q And for the golf tournament. 12 And you said on direct you took pictures with every 13 celebrity that came in there; right? 14 A Every celebrity that came in to talk to me, I took a 15 photograph with.

19 A I would say so, yes. 20 Q So the picture that you have or that was in evidence of 21 you with President Trump was just one of the dozens of pictures 22 that you took with celebrities; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And it was taken in a public place; right? 25 A Yes.

17 Q And you said that there were dozens of celebrities that 18 you took pictures with; right?

16 I don't remember all of the names.

2844 1 Q And there were no other pictures --
2 A Semi-publicly. 3 Q And there were no other pictures with you and President 4 Trump; right? 5 A Yeah. Right. 6 Q And you testified on direct that you spoke with 7 President Trump in the gift room and that after he left, his 8 bodyguard, Keith Schiller, came back and asked you for dinner -- 9 to dinner; right?

10 A They hadn't completely left. He walked back. 11 Q Keith Schiller walked back? 12 A Yes. 13 Q And he is the one who asked you to dinner; right? 14 A He asked me on behalf -- he didn't ask me to go to 15 dinner with him. 16 Q He's the one who spoke to you; right? 17 A Yes.

18 Q Keith Schiller, according to you -- 19 A He's -- that's -- he didn't say his name was Keith 20 Schiller, he said: "I work for Mr. Trump." 21 Q Okay. But it wasn't the President Trump, according 22 to your testimony, who asked you to dinner, it was his 23 bodyguard? 24 A Right. 25 Q And your testimony was that you said, "Fuck no." That 2845 1 you didn't -- you didn't want to go; right?

2 A Right. 3 Q But you gave Keith Schiller your phone number anyway 4 and you supposedly entered your phone number -- his phone number 5 into your contacts; right? 6 A Correct. 7 Q And according to you, later, Mike Mosny, your manager 8 at the time, told you that you should go to dinner at the time; 9 right?

10 A Correct. 11 Q But this is a totally different story than what you 12 told in 2011; isn't it? 13 A No. 14 Q Well, in your 2011 -- in 2011, you gave an interview 15 with In Touch Magazine; right? 16 A Yes. 17 Q And you said on direct that it was for only 15 minutes?

18 A For 15 to 20 minutes. It was a phone call. 19 Q Wasn't it more like an hour? 20 A I don't think so. 21 Q And didn't you tell In Touch Magazine that Donald Trump 22 himself asked if you would have dinner with him? 23 A I don't remember saying that. It was Keith. 24 Q All right. 25 MS. NECHELES: If we could show the witness and the 2846 1 parties J28, Page 3.

2 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 3 Q And am I correct that you said to In Touch Magazine 4 that when you first met Donald Trump, it was actually on the 5 golf course? 6 A Yes. 7 Q And that: "Later when he was in the gift room, he came 8 to talk to me and asked for my number and I gave it to him." 9 Do you recall saying that to In Touch Magazine?

17 Q All right.

18 A But he was there. They were together. 19 Q All right. So, didn't you say: "The first time I met 20 him was actually on the golf course;" right? 21 You said that? 22 A Uh-huh. 23 Q And when you said that, the "he" you were referring to 24 was Donald Trump; right? 25 A Keith was there as well, yes.

11 Q So you said that, in that Magazine in 2011, you said it 12 was Donald Trump who asked you for your number, right, not Keith 14 A I didn't specify. I left out the names of all of the 15 other people not to get them involved, that's why I specifically 16 said just "he" asked. 13 Schiller? 10 A Yes.

2847 1 Q And you said "he" was introduced to everyone. And 2 that's Donald Trump; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you said: "He kept looking at me. And then we 14 Q "And later when he came to the gift room, he came to 15 talk to me, he asked for my number and I give it to him." 16 And that's still President Trump; right?

17 A I gave my number to his bodyguard on his behalf, yes.

18 Q Well, that's not what you said in 2011? 19 A I didn't specify in 2011.

20 Q Well, you haven't mentioned a bodyguard in that 21 paragraph; have you?

22 A No. 23 Q The only "he" you were talking about -- 24 A They asked me to not mention other people.

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we let the witness finish.

5 ended up riding to another hole in the same golf cart together 6 and he's, like, I want to come talk to you later." Right?

7 A Uh-huh. 8 Q That's what you told them? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And that was still President Trump; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q So, still the same person you are talking about? 13 A Yes, which he did; he came to talk to me later.

2848 1 THE COURT: Please.

2 Q I'm sorry. 3 A I'm sorry. 4 THE COURT: You can finish your answer.

5 Do you want to hear the question again? 6 THE WITNESS: Yes, sorry.

7 THE COURT: Can you read back the question. 8 (Record read by the court reporter in open court.) 9 THE COURT: All right. You can finish your 10 answer. 11 THE WITNESS: Okay.

12 A (Continuing.) They tried to get me not to mention 13 other people when they asked me who, who ask who for whose 18 A It wasn't the reporter. 19 Q Who was it?

20 A My publicist. He didn't want his name mentioned. 21 Q Okay.

22 MS. NECHELES: So if we can -- 23 A Ex-publicist. Sorry. 24 MS. NECHELES: If we can skip down to the last 25 paragraph.

14 number or whatever. But it was Keith. He was standing there.

15 He was always with President Trump. 16 Q All right. So your testimony now is that the reporter 17 didn't want you to mention the name Keith?

2849 1 Q So you say, "I went up to the room and I was met 2 outside by his bodyguard Keith?" 3 A Keith, yes. 4 Q So you mentioned Keith's name; right? 5 A Yes. 6 Q But you didn't mention it in the first paragraph; 7 right? 8 A Right. 9 Q In the first paragraph you were only talking about 10 President Trump; right? 11 A Hmmm, it even says here, "That's how I got in touch 12 with him. I never had Donald telephone's number. I always used 13 Keith." 14 Q My question was: In the first paragraph, you were only 15 talking about President Trump; right? 16 A No. 17 Q Well, that's the only reference --
18 A They were always together. Like this. (Witness 19 indicating.) 20 Q But you didn't say that in 2011? 21 A When I give my number to someone and visa versa, it 22 goes through my manager or bodyguard, anyone who has security or 23 a handler knows that they are a unit. 24 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I move to strike that. 25 MS. HOFFINGER: It's her answer, your Honor.

2850 1 THE COURT: Overruled.

2 Q And in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you 3 said that -- well, you testified yesterday that when you were 4 asked to dinner, you said, "No fucking way;" right? 5 That's what you testified on Tuesday; right? 6 A Correct.

10 A Like I said, a bodyguard or a handler is a unit. 11 Q And -- 12 A Someone who is speaking on your behalf is the same as 13 being asked directly. 14 Q And you told the interviewer that you said "Of course;" 15 right? 16 A Uh-huh. 17 Q Right. So you said, "Then he asked me if I wanted 18 to have dinner that night and I was like, yeah, of course;" 19 right? 20 A Yes. Those were the words of my publicist, actually, 21 who said go to dinner with him. He's fascinating. What's the 22 worst that could happen? 23 Q Well, that's what you said that you responded to 24 President Trump that night; right? 25 A This is an entertainment magazine. It is very short 7 Q But in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you 8 said that Donald Trump himself asked if you would have dinner 9 with him; right?

2851 1 and frivolous.

2 And a very vast difference between someone who is a reality 10 A It was minus some details. It is a short interview. 11 Q And then you -- and you further told the interviewer: 12 "Who would pass up an opportunity to talk to someone so 13 interesting;" right? 14 A Yes. 15 Q And so, that's what you said in 2011, that you were 21 thought you were going out for dinner; right? 22 A Yes. 23 Q But your story is that even though you spent over three 24 hours in the hotel room, you never got any dinner; right? 25 A We never got any food.

5 Q Now, you are saying that you lied in 2011 when you made 6 this story -- when you were telling this story; right? 7 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 Q Okay. You were telling the truth when you gave this 9 story -- this interview?

19 Q And you testified on direct examination on Tuesday that 20 when you supposedly went to President Trump's hotel room, you 16 happy to go to dinner with him. Immediately, you were happy to 17 go to dinner with President Trump; right?

18 A Yes.

3 TV star and the President. This is an abbreviated, entertaining 4 version of the events.

2852 1 It never -- we never ate, no.

2 Q And you previously said that you specifically remember 3 this because your stomach was growling; right? 4 A Yes. 5 Q And you wrote in your book: "Plus I was freaking 6 hungry. I needed a bowl of pretzels at least, if I was going to 7 sit through this." 8 You said: "There was going to be dinner, I thought. This 9 monologue went on for a good 10 or 15 minutes, which is an 10 eternity when your stomach is growling and you are hungry." 11 A Yes. 12 Q And you are saying that this was a big deal that you 13 didn't get dinner; right? 14 A I was invited. It was dinnertime. I was running 15 hungry, yeah. 16 We talked about ordering food or going down to get food, and 17 we never got to eat.

18 It was dinnertime, and we never ate. 19 Q And you made a big point of that on numerous 20 interviews; right? 21 A Yeah, I went to go to dinner and I didn't get dinner. 22 Q And you gave an interview with Jimmy Kimmel; right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And you said: "Actually, we never had dinner. Like, 25 he lied to me. I'm very food motivated. That's why I stayed 2853 1 and held out for so long, because I was told there would be 2 snacks. I was starving." 3 That's what you said; right? 4 A Yes. 5 Q So this was a -- this was a clear memory that you had, 6 that you were not fed dinner and you were starving; right? 7 A Right. It was dinnertime. I was invited to dinner, 8 but I never actually saw any food. 9 Q But in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you 11 A I never said we ate. 12 Q No? 13 A No. 14 Q So I direct your attention -- 15 MS. NECHELES: If we could put up, again, J28. 16 A I remember ordering. Or asking to order. 17 (Displayed only to the aforementioned parties.)
18 Q And do you recall that you said that you had dinner 19 with President Trump while you talked about whether he would put 20 you on The Apprentice? 21 A Uh-uh. I don't have anything here. 22 Q I'm asking if you recall that? 23 A I don't. I need to see what I said. 24 Q All right. So I direct your attention to J28, Page 4. 25 (Displayed only to the aforementioned parties.)
10 said the opposite; didn't you?

2854 1 Q Look at the bottom of the page.

2 Do you recall being asked: "So this is all conversation 3 while you are eating?" And you responded, "Yeah, like before, 4 during and after. We hung out for quite awhile. A few hours at 5 least." Right? 6 A What is this from? Okay. 7 Q Do you recall being asked that and giving that 8 answer? 9 A I don't recall exactly, no.

11 A I don't remember saying that. 10 Q Okay. Are you saying you didn't say that? 12 Q And if we could direct your attention to the bottom of 15 Q And do you recall being asked, "Again, so this was all 16 during dinner?" And you responding, "Yeah, during, after, yeah, 17 it was definitely the biggest, longest topic of conversation."
18 A Yes. 19 Q "How he could get me on." 20 A And it was dinner. I was invited to dinner, and it was 21 dinnertime. 22 I maintained that I didn't see any food. We didn't go down. 23 We never left the room to go down to dinner, like I said. My 24 story is the same. 25 Q So you did say that, you were asked that question and 13 Page 7. 14 A Page 7?

2855 1 you gave that answer?

2 A It was dinner, but we never got food. 3 Q So when, when the reporter asked you, "This was all 4 during dinner?" You are saying, "During dinner," meaning it was 5 dinnertime, but we didn't eat? 6 A Correct. I would have definitely mentioned what I ate 7 in all of these interviews. 8 I would have talked about the food. I'm very food 10 Q All right. And do you recall being interviewed on -- 11 by Anderson Cooper on CNN in 2018; right? 12 A Do I remember doing the interview? 13 Q Yes. 14 A Yes. 15 Q And do you recall that in that interview you again said 16 you "had dinner that night with President Trump in the room"? 17 A Can I see what I said exactly?

18 Q You don't have any recollection? 19 A I would like to see what I said exactly. 20 Q You had testified to all of these details of -- about 21 what the tiling of the floor was like on direct examination, but 22 you don't recall what you said in 2018? 23 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 24 THE COURT: Sustained. 25 Q I will show you what is marked as J12, and directing 9 motivated.

2856 1 your attention to Page 598.

2 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 7 And then I know that I went on to explain that I didn't 8 actually ever get to eat dinner. 9 You are showing one sentence of an entire conversation.

10 Q You say that in this interview you said that you -- 11 well, so isn't it correct that Anderson Cooper said to you: 12 "ANDERSON COOPER: Did you two go out for dinner that 13 night?" 15 "ANDERSON COOPER: You had dinner in the room?" 16 "STORMY DANIELS: Yes." 17 That was the conversation; right?

18 A Where is the rest of the conversation? 19 Q And he said: "What happened next?" Right? 20 A Uh-huh. 21 Q That was the conversation about dinner; right? 22 A Yes. Where we don't talk about receiving food. What I 23 ate. Which I definitely would have talked about. 24 Q Okay. But you said you had dinner in the room; 25 right?

3 Q Yes, directing your attention to Page 598. And in that 4 interview, you said you had dinner in the room; right? 5 A It says, "Did we go out for dinner? No, you had dinner 6 in the room? Yes.

14 "STORMY DANIELS: No."
2857 3 Q Okay. So -- 4 A And I have maintained that in every interview, that I
6 Q And you are saying --
7 A That has not changed. 8 Q So you are saying, like, when you said to Anderson 9 Cooper that you had dinner in the room, you really didn't mean 10 that you had dinner, you meant something else; right? 11 A We had dinnertime in the room.

12 Q Your words don't mean what you say; do they?

16 Trump were staying in different hotels; right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q He was staying at The Harrah's Hotel? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And you were staying at The Harvey Hotel; right? 21 A I don't remember.

22 Q Well, The Harvey Hotel was -- you understood that The 23 Harvey Hotel and The Harrah's Hotel had a common owner; right? 24 A What?

25 Q They had common ownership?

14 THE COURT: Sustained.

15 Q And you testified on Tuesday that you and President 1 A I went up to his room to have dinner, yes. We did not 2 have any food. And I did not eat any food.

5 never actually got my food.

13 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

2858 1 A I did not know.

2 Q Well, that's where the events were taking place in the 3 golf tournament; right? 4 A I didn't know. 5 Q And they are located one block away from each other; 6 right? 7 A I don't remember. 8 Q And so it was your testimony on direct that you walked 9 and then took a car to go one block?

10 A Uh-huh. I went to a tattoo studio shop first to see my 11 friends. And I was wearing heels, and so I took a car the rest 13 Q Okay. And the tattoo studio was two blocks away; 14 right? 15 A I don't remember. 16 Q And isn't it a fact that you -- when you gave an 17 interview to In Touch Magazine in 2011, you said that you 18 remember walking from your hotel to his hotel? 19 A I don't remember exactly. Like I said, it was an 20 abbreviated interview. I did make a stop at a tattoo shop for 21 like an hour. 22 Q Okay. I will show you what has been marked as J28. 23 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 24 Q And, by the way, this abbreviated interview is 29 pages 25 long; right?

12 of the way.

2859 1 A I don't know. I mean, there are photos. And who 2 knows. 3 Q And directing your attention to Page 4, the bottom 4 paragraph. 5 A Uh-huh. From -- 6 Q Well, I want to direct your attention to the top part 7 of this.

10 Do you recall saying during that interview: "We ended up 11 having dinner in the room. I cannot remember what we ordered. 12 I remember what I had the second time I had dinner with him, but 13 I can't remember what we had." 14 Do you recall saying that? 15 A Hang on. 16 (Pause.) 17 Q You said that in that interview; didn't you, 18 Ms. Daniels? 19 A Yeah. It says, "I don't remember ordering anything or 20 what I ordered, if anything." 21 Q But you say twice there: "We had dinner in the room." 22 Right? 23 A Yes. Like I said, it was dinnertime in the room. 24 Q So you are saying that when you said "we had dinner," 25 you did not mean that; right?

8 Just going back a minute. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, five 9 lines from the top.

2860 1 A I'm saying a -- once again, I had dinner in his room, 2 but we never got our food. And I never ate anything. 3 Q Okay. 4 A Having dinner with somebody, at least where I'm from, 5 doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put food in your 6 mouth. I'm going to someone's house for dinner. It's 7 dinnertime. 8 Q And isn't it a fact that when you wrote your book, you 9 said you walked from your hotel to President Trump's hotel?

10 A I walked halfway there or I -- actually, I think I went 11 in the opposite direction first. 12 Q And you don't say anything in your book about taking a 13 car; right? 14 A I don't remember exactly. 15 Q But when you were interviewed by the Prosecutors in 16 this case, the first time, you told them that President Trump's 17 bodyguard sent a car to pick you up and take you to the room; 18 didn't you? 19 A I don't know how the car got there or who sent it 20 specifically. I have no way of knowing who I was speaking to, 21 who -- or who sent the car. 22 Q Well, when you testified on Tuesday, you said that you 23 called a car -- you said you walked and then you said you called 24 a car? 25 A I called for a car? I don't know how the car was 2861 1 called.

2 I told them that I was going -- that I needed a car. I 3 don't know if they called the car. I don't remember. I know it 4 was before Uber, obviously. 5 Q The details of your story keep changing; right? 6 A No. I took a car from the tattoo shop to his hotel. 7 Q Okay. And you testified on direct examination that 8 when you supposedly entered the suite, that President Trump came 9 from the main area of the hotel suite and met you in the foyer; 10 right? 11 A Yes. 12 Q And you say that there were -- the elevator -- no, 13 withdrawn. 14 But when you were interviewed for -- in 2011, for In Touch 15 Magazine, you said that when you walked into the hotel suite, 16 President Trump was all sprawled out on the couch watching 17 television or something; right?

18 A I don't remember saying that. 19 Q Well, if you could look at J28. And directing your 20 attention to Page 4. 21 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 24 (Pause.) 25 Q You said: "I went in, and I was all dressed up, 22 Q Do you recall -- well, let's start at the bottom of 23 Page 3.

2862 1 because I had just assumed that we were going to go to dinner, 2 but he meant to have dinner in his room. Like, he wasn't 3 dressed." 4 And then if I could direct your attention to Page 4. "To go 5 out at all. Just lounging. I remember taking a jab at him. I 6 remember saying because he was all sprawled out on the couch 7 watching television or something. And he was wearing pajama 8 pants." 9 Do you remember saying that?

10 A Yes. I walked in. He was on the couch. He heard me 11 come in. 12 He got up and he greeted me in the foyer. 13 Q I see. So you say he was all sprawled out on the couch 14 there, and now you are saying "but he got up." That's what you 15 saying now? 16 A He did both. He greeted me from the foyer. He came 17 from the inside from where the couches and things were, I
18 assumed he was watching television, but he definitely wasn't 19 getting dressed. 20 Q Okay. But you didn't say that in your 2011 interview; 21 did you? 22 A No, I did not. Like I said, it was a shorter 23 interview. 24 Q Okay. And you testified on direct -- 25 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, is this a good time for 2863 1 a break?

2 THE COURT: I would like to go a little longer. 3 Q You testified on direct that after being in President 4 Trump's hotel suite for several hours, you went to the bathroom; 5 right? 6 A Correct. 7 Q And you claim when you came out of the bathroom he was 8 on the bed in a T-shirt and boxer shorts; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q Just one minute before we get to that. 11 I want to go back to where President Trump was when you 12 entered the hotel suite room. 13 Do you recall you wrote a book about this; right? 14 A Yes. 15 Q And do you recall that when you say, when you opened 16 the door -- withdrawn. 17 Let's just go back to the room.

18 So you say you came out of the bathroom and he was on the 19 bed in his T-shirt and boxer shorts; right? 20 A Yes. 21 Q And, according to you, when you saw him sitting on the 22 bed, you became faint, the room started to spin and the blood 23 left your hands and feet, yes? 24 A Yes. It was shock. Surprise. 25 Q So just so I can be clear on what you are saying, 2864 1 you've acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies; right?

2 A 150-ish, yes. 5 A Yes. 6 Q And, but according to you, seeing a man sitting on a 7 bed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, was so upsetting that you 8 got light headed, blood left your hands and feet, and you almost 9 fainted; right?

10 A Yes. When you are not expecting a man twice your age 11 to be in their underwear -- I have seen my husband naked almost 12 everyday -- if I came out of the bathroom and it was not my 13 husband and it was Mr. Trump on the bed, I would probably have 14 the same reaction. 15 Q And that made you feel like you were going to faint? 16 A Absolutely. If I came out of the bathroom and saw an 17 older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting seeing there, 18 yeah. 19 Q And, according to you, earlier that evening, you had 20 been bossing President Trump around and telling him to change 21 his clothes out of pajamas and to stop talking about himself; 22 right? 23 A That was hours before, yeah, I was in -- I guess it was 24 seeing a man in his underwear that you are not expecting to be 25 there, when you are not expecting him to be there.

3 Q And there are naked men and naked women having sex, 4 including yourself in those movies; right?

2865 1 Q And you were a pretty assertive woman; right?

2 A More so now. 3 Q Well, you have been working since you were 18; 4 right?

5 A Seventeen. 6 Q Seventeen. And you've had to take care of yourself, 8 A Yes, ma'am. 9 Q And some of the places you were working in are pretty 10 tough places to work in; right? 11 A Sometimes.

12 Q And you have taken care of yourself that whole time; 13 right? 14 A Mostly, yes.

15 Q And you said that even though he was twice your age, 16 you had no problem bossing him around that whole day; right?

17 A Yes. When I felt like I had control of the situation 21 A I did earlier.

22 Q Those were your words, right, "you had made him your 23 bitch?" 24 A Yes.

25 Q Right?

18 and I had an exit; and this was definitely a power shift. 19 Q Well, in your book, in fact, you wrote that "you had 20 made him your bitch;" right?

7 you said, since you were 17; right?

2866 1 A Yes.

2 Q Because you are powerful; right? 3 A I used to think so. 4 Q But now, because he was supposedly in a T-shirt and 5 boxer shorts, you were so upset that he wanted to have sex with 6 you that you couldn't speak up and say that you didn't want to 7 have sex with him? 8 A Correct. 9 Q Right?

10 A Correct. 11 Q The man who you claimed "I made him my bitch," but I
12 can't say no to having sex with him supposedly; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q This was not the first time in your life someone had 15 made a pass at you; was it? 16 A No.

17 Q And you testified on direct examination --
18 A But it was the first time that they had a bodyguard 19 standing outside the door and they were in their underwear.

20 Q Okay -- 21 A And they were twice my age and bigger than me.

22 Q Okay. And you understand there is no question 23 pending? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

25 THE COURT: Sustained.

2867 1 Q And you testified on direct that Mr. Trump got out of 2 bed and stood between you and the door, to the exit of the 3 bedroom and said something like: I thought we were getting 4 somewhere, we were talking and I thought you were serious about 5 what you wanted, if you ever want to get out of that trailer 6 park.

7 Those were his words that you said that he said? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And you said you blacked out and the next thing you 10 remember was being on the bed and having sex; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q But when you were interviewed in 2011 by In Touch 13 Magazine, you told a completely different story; didn't you? 14 A No. 17 the bed and he said, "Come here."
18 And you were like, "Oh, here we go." 19 And then you started kissing and had sex.

20 That's the story that you told in 2011; isn't it? 21 A Like I said, there were parts in the middle that I
22 didn't remember. 23 Q Well, isn't that the story that you told in 2011; 24 right?

25 A I don't remember exactly what I said.

15 Q Well, when you were interviewed in 2011, you said that 16 when you came out of the bathroom, Donald Trump was sitting on 2868 1 Q Okay. I'm going to direct your attention to J28, 2 Page 8. 3 A Uh-huh. 4 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 5 Q And do you recall saying, "I had to use the bathroom. 6 And I went to the restroom, which was in the bedroom. Like I 7 said, it was a big suite. I could describe the suite perfectly 8 when I came out. He was sitting on the bed and he was like, 9 'come here.' And I was like, 'Oh, here we go.' And we started 10 kissing." 11 "I actually don't even know why I did it, but I do remember 12 while we were having sex I was like, please, don't try to pay 13 me. And then I remember thinking, but if I did -- but if he 14 did, I bet -- no, but, I bet if he did, it would be a lot." 15 That's what you said to In Touch Magazine in 2011; right? 16 A Correct. Yes, because I wasn't trying to get money, 17 and he did say, "Come here."
18 Q Nothing about him standing up; right? 19 A No. I didn't -- I mean, it's not here. This was an 20 abbreviated article. 21 But he did stand up. And he was between me and the door, 22 and Keith was outside the door. 23 And then I don't remember -- and then I remember we were 24 kissing and he was on top of me. 25 That's what I remember. I --
2869 1 Q You remember what you said to -- withdrawn.

2 THE COURT: We can only have one person speaking at 3 a time. 6 A Uh-huh, yes. 7 Q Nothing about him standing up; right? 8 A But it also doesn't say that I got on the bed. This is 9 an abbreviated version. He stood up. We started kissing. It 10 has been edited for clearing. 11 Q It doesn't say he stood up; did it? 12 A No, it doesn't say that he stood up either. 13 Q You said that he said, "Come here;" right? 14 A He did, he said, "Come here." 15 Q Meaning you should come to the bed? 16 A He stood up and said, "Come here." 17 Q It doesn't say that, does it?

18 A No, it doesn't. 19 Q And then you said, "We started kissing." Right? 20 A Yes. 21 Q Nothing about if you want to get what you want to get, 22 you better go along with this; right? 23 A They left out a lot of stuff because they couldn't 25 I do remember them telling me that.

4 Q So what you said to In Touch Magazine was: "We started 5 kissing." Right?

24 fact-check it.

2870

1 Q And nothing about a trailer park; right?
2 A No. 3 Q And you made that -- you have made all of this up; 4 right?

5 A No. 6 Q And, by the way, you weren't drinking anything that 7 night? 8 A Just water. 9 Q No drugs; right?

10 A Absolutely no. 11 Q But you supposedly, you blacked out; right?

12 A I got lightheaded. I never blacked out. I didn't, 13 like, hit the floor. 14 I just -- everything spun and went black.

15 But, no, I was not given any drugs.

18 the room. 19 Q And, in 2011, you said that you were fascinated and 20 stimulated by President Trump and had really good banter and 21 that you could tell he was a nice, intelligent -- he was nice, 22 intelligent in conversation. Right? 23 A It was a nice, intelligent conversation, yes. 24 Q That's what you said; right?

25 A Yes.

16 I did not take any drugs.

17 And there was -- I don't even believe there was alcohol in 2871 1 Q And nothing about him threatening you with a trailer 2 park; right? 3 A That was after I came out of the bathroom. There was 4 no more conversation. The conversation was intelligent and 5 interesting. I enjoyed it. 6 Q And you were interviewed for Slate Magazine by 7 Mr. Weisberg in 2018; right? 8 A I'm not sure that was his name. 9 Q Okay. Let me show you J45.

10 (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.) 11 Q It was a 2018 interview by Jacob Weisberg; right?

12 A Yes. That's what it says. 13 Q And this story gets published right after the Wall 14 Street Journal article; right?

15 A I believe so, yes. January 16th. 16 Q The Wall Street Journal article, you recall, was on 17 January 12th?

18 A January 12th. Yes, ma'am. 19 Q On January 12th 2018. And this was on January 16th to 20 18; is that right? 21 A That's what it says.

22 Q And am I correct that you told Mr. Weisberg that there 23 was no abuse in what happened with President Trump and that you 24 were not a victim; right?

25 A Yes.

2872

1 Q And this is what you were saying in 2018; right?

2 A Yes.
3 Q And you said that the worst that Trump had done was 4 break promises you never believed that he would fulfill; right? 5 A Yes. 6 Q And you told Weisberg that President Trump offered to 7 buy you a condom in Tampa, Florida, and that he wanted to 8 feature you as a contestant on an upcoming season of The 9 Celebrity Apprentice; right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q You didn't say anything to Mr. Weisberg about you 12 supposedly blacking out or not remembering how you ended up in 15 Q You said the worst thing he did was he didn't give you 16 a condom; right? 17 A Yes, I never wanted a condom.

18 Q Oh, you didn't want a condom? 19 A No, not in Tampa, Florida. 20 Q Well, you said the worst thing he did was he didn't put 21 you on The Celebrity Apprentice; right? 22 A I said the worst thing he did was that he lied. 23 Q And you said nothing about a power imbalance or that 24 you were scared that there was a bodyguard standing outside of 25 the door; right?

14 A Correct. 13 bed; right?

2873 3 Q Okay. And you were also -- 4 A I blame myself -- 5 Q And you didn't say anything about -- 6 A -- for feeling that way. 7 Q And you didn't say anything about feeling those things 8 that you just described happened?

13 A And, I'm sorry, what did you say? 14 Q You didn't say anything about feeling faint in there, 15 when this happened; right? 16 A No. Because the question was what Mr. Trump did. And 17 Mr. Trump did not drug me. And he did not -- that was how I
18 felt, the worst thing that he did was lie in that moment. 19 Q Right. And you were also interviewed by Vogue Magazine 20 in 2018; right? 21 A Yes. 22 Q And isn't it correct that you were asked: "Did Trump 23 do something that made you feel like you had to have sex with 24 him?" And you responded, "No, nothing;" right? 25 A Yes.

1 A No. I said the worst thing that he did was lie.

2 That's my feelings.

11 THE COURT: Overruled. I think she was done. 12 Overruled.

9 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you please let the witness 10 finish, your Honor.

2874 1 Q And so, in 2018, you said that there was nothing that 2 he did that made you feel like you -- that you had to have sex 3 with him, but on Tuesday, on direct exam, you testified that he 4 made nasty comments and stood over you and you felt a power 5 shift; right?

11 A My own insecurities made me feel that way. I have 12 maintained that he has not -- he did not put his hands on me. 13 He did not give me any sort of drugs or alcohol, and he did 16 And I have said that, and I maintain that. I was not 17 physically threatened or drugged or drunk.

18 Q But these nasty -- supposed nasty comments that he made 19 and standing up over you, those statements were not what you 20 were saying in 2018; right? 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 22 THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer. 23 A Those statements are exactly what I said. 24 Q You said -- 25 A He said that he thought that I was on the same page 6 A I never said he stood over me. He stood in front of 7 me. I was not below him or on the floor. 8 Q So you were saying, when you testified on Tuesday, that 9 his actions made you feel like you had to have sex with him; 10 right? 14 not hold a weapon or hold me at any sort of -- threaten me with 15 any short of an item.

2875 1 about going onto the television show.

2 That is exactly what it was -- 3 Q In 2018 -- 4 A -- he lied about that and stood in front of me and he 5 never had any intention of --
8 A Which part? That he stood in front of me and said I 9 thought you wanted to prove that you could do this? That's 10 exactly what he said. 11 Q You didn't say that in the Kold article; right, when I
12 asked you about whether you said that to anybody? 13 Do you understand my question? 14 A No, I don't.

15 Q Okay. In 2018, you didn't tell the Kold writer that 16 President Trump had supposedly said that to you; did you?

17 A I said that he promised me a part in The Celebrity 18 Apprentice. He thought that I was intelligent and would do 19 whatever it takes. My own insecurities in that moment kept me 21 Q You didn't say that --
22 A I have maintained that he did not physically threaten 23 me in any way. 24 Q Okay. You claim that that's in the article, in the 25 Kold article?

6 Q My question to you is just: In 2018, you didn't say 7 any of that to anybody; did you?

20 from saying no.

2876 1 A I don't know what's in the Kold article, but my story 2 hasn't changed. 3 Q You didn't say that then; did you? 4 A I don't know. 5 Q And, now, in 2024, your story has changed; hasn't it? 6 A No. Not at all. You are trying to make me say that it 7 changed, but it hasn't changed. 8 Q And I want to talk about the night after the evening 9 that you claim that you had sex with President Trump. So the 10 American Century Championship, which was a Golf Celebrity 11 Tournament which had celebrities in both hotels, and so they had 12 parties and events; right? 13 A Several, yeah. 14 Q And, in fact, you testified that many of the parties 15 were in your hotel; right? 16 A I don't know which parties were part of the event and 17 not, but there were parties in both hotels.

18 Q Well, you testified -- 19 A I have no way of knowing which parties were sanctioned 20 for that. 21 Q You testified that there was an auction in your hotel 22 of celebrity items; there were a couple of auctions, yeah? 23 And you said that there was a nightclub in the hotel? 24 A Bar, restaurant, nightclub things, yeah. 25 Q And you testified that -- well, you have said that 2877 1 President Trump called you from his bodyguard's phone and 2 invited you to come have drinks with him at the nightclub 3 downstairs in the hotel that night; right? 4 A Yes, I said yes. 5 Q And you said you met him in the VIP area, and that 6 Trump was there and Ben Roethlisberger and Keith Schiller were 7 there? 8 A He was sitting in a booth. 9 Q With Roethlisberger?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And while you were there, you talked -- and you went 12 and talked with them; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And while you were there, you talked about The 15 Apprentice; right? 17 Q And you testified on direct that that conversation or 18 that encounter lasted for about ten minutes; right? 19 A I would say so. 20 Q But in your book you said you were there for about an 21 hour; right? 22 A The conversation -- Mr. Trump left first. He was there 23 for like maybe 10 or 15 minutes. 24 Q Well, in your book didn't you say it was "max an hour?" 25 A "Max an hour," yeah.

16 A Very briefly, yes.

2878 1 Q And President Trump then left you alone with 2 Roethlisberger; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you said that at that point you really believed 5 that President Trump wanted to put you on The Celebrity 6 Apprentice; correct? 7 A I did at that time, yes. 8 Q And you -- and that was because of that conversation; 9 right?

10 A Which conversation? 11 Q Well, the conversation in that nightclub, that was one 12 of the conversations; right? 13 A That was one of them, yeah. 14 Q And then there were other conversations on the phone as 15 well, right, about that? 16 A I only had two conversations by the time, at that 17 incident which was in the nightclub, the one the night before 18 and the one sitting in that moment. 19 Q Okay. 20 A So based on those two conversations, yes. 21 Q And you had other conversations later -- 22 A Later. 23 Q And you said -- you told Jimmy Kimmel, in fact, didn't 24 you, that you thought that President Trump thought that it would 25 be great for the ratings; right?

2879 1 A Uh-huh.

2 Q And that's what your discussions were with him; right? 3 A That's what he told me, yes. 4 Q And that's what you talked about in your phone calls 7 Q And he also talked about that when you went to Trump 9 A Yes.

10 Q And, by the way, you took a selfie of yourself and your 11 friend in his office in Trump Towers; right? 12 A Well, my friend did. 13 Q And that was in 2007; right? 14 A Yes. 15 Q But you have no other pictures with President Trump 16 other than that one picture? 17 A Right.

19 A We took a picture with him at the Trump Vodka Party and 20 in his office. 21 Q And in his office? 22 A I didn't physically take them, my friends did. 23 Q The Trump Vodka Party was a party where he invited lots 24 of minor celebrities; right? 25 A Yes. 18 Q With her?

5 with President Trump; right? 6 A Partially, yes. 8 Tower; right?

2880 1 Q And that was all public; right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And then you also went to -- you asked to be -- for 4 tickets to the Miss USA Pageant; right? 5 A I'm sorry. What was that? 6 Q You also asked for tickets to the Miss USA Beauty 7 Pageant; right? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And you went with your agent too; right?

10 A Yes. I went with my agent. 11 Q And that was also in public; right? 12 A Yes, but I did not speak with him there. 13 THE COURT: Miss Necheles, would you like to take a 14 break? 15 MS. NECHELES: Yes. 16 THE COURT: All right. Jurors, let's go ahead and 17 take our morning break.

21 All rise. 22 (Jury exits.) 23 ********** 24 THE COURT: You can step down. 25 Thank you. 20 THE COURT OFFICER: Leave your notepads. 19 You can step out. 18 Let's take about 15 minutes.

19 CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION
20 BY MS. NECHELES: 21 Q Ms. Daniels, before we took the break, we were talking 22 about you being at a nightclub with President Trump and Ben 23 Roethlisberger, right?

24 A Yes, ma'am. 25 Q And at some point President Trump left, and he left Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
 Principal Court Reporter 2882 2883 1 you alone with Ben Roethlisberger, right?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And you testified on your cross-examination, just a 4 little while ago, I was asking questions about Make America 5 Horny Tour, right? 6 A Yes.

7 Q And you said you hated that name, right? 9 Q And that you never posted it yourself, right?

10 A I never made any of those flyers. 11 Q And you never posted it on your social media you 12 testified, right? 13 A Sometimes they made me re-tweet them, but I never made 14 any of the flyers and posted them on my own accord.

15 Q You said sometimes you may have had to re-tweet them 16 but that's it, right?

17 A Yeah. As a matter of fact, I fired a webmaster for 18 posting them. 19 Q I want to direct your attention to -- showing you what 20 has been marked as J-49. Susan -- 21 (Whereupon, the District Attorneys were 22 shown a document.) 23 Q Do you recognize that as coming from your Instagram 25 A Yes.

24 account?

8 A Yes.

2884 1 MS. NECHELES: I will offer that in evidence, 2 your Honor. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection. 4 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

5 Q And that's posted on your Instagram account, right? 6 A Yes. It was reposted from Deja Vu.

17 for.

18 Q And you posted that on your personal Instagram, right? 19 A Yes. That's not my personal Instagram. That's my 20 business Instagram. 21 Q And I want to direct your attention now to J-50, which 22 is just for the witness and the parties. 23 Do you recognize that as being another post from your 24 Instagram?

25 A Yes. That was the very first one.

7 Q And that was February 2nd, 2018, is that correct? 8 A February 24th -- oh, sorry. Yes. 9 Q And there is a picture of you and that you are going 10 to be somewhere on February 24th, right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q And it says, Stormy Daniels Performing Live, Make 13 America Horny Again 2018 Tour, right? 14 A Yes.

15 Q And that's you posing for that picture, right? 16 A Well, it's a flier made up of a photo that I posed 2885 1 MS. NECHELES: And I offer that in evidence, your 2 Honor. 3 THE COURT: Any objections? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: No objections.

5 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 6 Q And that posted on January 14, 2018, right?

19 A For my appearances, yes.

20 Q And making money off of that? 21 A That's what you do with tours.

22 Q And turning your attention back to the tournament, the 23 celebrity golf tournament, President Trump was the biggest 24 celebrity, probably, at that tournament, right?

25 A It depends on what you are a fan of.

7 A Yes. 8 Q And it says, Stormy Daniels, the Making America Horny 9 Again Tour, right?

10 A Yes. 11 Q And you posted that on your personal Instagram, right?

12 A That's my public Instagram. 13 Q Your public Instagram, right? 14 And you said, see you soon South Carolina, right?

15 A Yes. 16 Q And those are just two of many that you posted, right?

17 A I don't know.

18 Q But you were advertising for that tour, right?

2886 1 Q Well, people recognized him, right?

2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Q Well, you saw people following him around, right?

5 A Yes. A lot of people are paid to follow him around I 6 am sure. I don't know.

7 Q And he did very well at that golf tournament, right? 8 A I don't remember.

12 Q And so, when -- when you saw that -- when he went -- 13 where he went, people were recognizing who he was, right? 14 A Yes, but --
15 Q You recognized that -- 16 A They recognized me where I went that day too.

17 Q Okay.

18 And, according to you, when you went up to his hotel 19 suite, there were double doors to the outside of the hotel, 20 before you got into the suite, right? 21 A From the exterior, you mean the hallway?

22 Q Yes. 23 A Yes. There was a door that was cracked. One door was 24 open, but there was a second wider door.

25 Q And so, you said Keith Schiller was standing outside 9 Q He was playing golf himself?

10 A He was playing golf. I don't remember what the scores 11 were.

2887 1 of the hotel suite, right?

2 A Yes. He was leaning against the wall by the door. 3 Q And when you went in there was another -- there was a 4 door to the bedroom, right?

5 A The door to the bedroom was quite a ways away. 6 Q What was that?

7 A Really far away. 8 Q Okay. 9 So when you went into the bedroom, it was very far 10 away from where Keith Schiller was, right? 11 A I don't know where he was at that point in time.

12 Q You didn't see him inside the suite, did you? 13 A I never saw him inside, no, ma'am. 14 Q So you were in the bedroom, and the door to the 15 bedroom was closed? 16 A No.

17 Q The door to the bedroom was open, but it was very far 18 away from where the front door was? 19 A All the doors were open.

20 Q The bedroom was very far away from the front door you 21 just said?

22 A It was off of the living room, yes. 23 Q And you claimed that one of the things that made you 24 feel uncomfortable or feel like you couldn't walk out was that 25 Keith Schiller was standing outside of the --
2888 1 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. That's not the 2 testimony. 3 THE COURT: Sustained. 4 Q Well, was that your testimony, that you were -- one of 5 the things that went through your mind about why you couldn't 6 just leave was because Keith Schiller was outside the hotel 7 suite? 8 A Absolutely. I would have had to pass by him and get 9 to an elevator and wait for an elevator, and he was a very 10 large man. 11 Q Well, do you recall being interviewed by Vogue 12 magazine in 2018? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And do you recall saying to their -- you were asked, 15 did Trump do something that made you feel like you had to have 16 sex with him?

17 And you being emphatic, no. Nothing. Not once did I
18 ever feel like I was in any sort of physical danger. I am sure 19 if I had taken off running, he wouldn't have given chase, and 20 even if I had, there is no way that he could have caught me. 21 Do you recall saying that?

22 A Yes. 23 Q You didn't mention anything, but, oh, there was a 24 bodyguard outside the door, did you?

25 A I don't remember if I did or not. I don't control 2889 1 what parts of quotes they put in magazines and how many details 2 they use. Vogue is an entertainment magazine and it is a 3 fashion magazine. 4 Sometimes I give too many details.

5 Q So you last spoke with President Trump in 2007, 15 Q So you have no personal knowledge about his 20 A Yes. 21 Q And you did not negotiate that Non-Disclosure 22 Agreement with President Trump, did you? 23 A Not directly, my attorney. 24 Q And your lawyer dealt with Michael Cohen, right?

25 A Yes.

7 A Well, the last time, is that what you said? 8 Q Yes. 9 A Yes.

10 Q And it was a long time ago, right? 11 A Yes, non.

12 Q And you never spoke with President Trump in connection 13 with your being paid $130,000 to sell the story, did you? 14 A No.

16 involvement in that transaction, or what he did, do you?

17 A Not directly, no.

18 Q And am I correct that you signed the Non-Disclosure 19 Agreement in this case with legal advice?

6 correct?

2890

1 Q And Mr. Cohen paid you, not Mr. Trump, right?

2 A Actually, my attorney paid me. 3 Q Okay.
4 But you understand that the money came from Michael 5 Cohen, right? 6 A I know the --
7 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection. 8 THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer. 9 A I know that the money was wired to me from Keith 10 Davidson. 11 Q Okay.

12 And did you understand that the money was wired to 13 Keith Davidson? 14 A That's what I understood, but I have no proof.

15 Q Okay. 16 Then you understand that in this case President Trump 17 is charged with a crime for how the payment reimbursing Mr.

18 Cohen was labeled on President Trump's books, you understand 19 that, right?

20 A I am not an attorney. I don't really understand. I 21 am just here to answer the questions that are asked to me about 22 specific things that I have knowledge of. 23 Q Okay. 24 Even though you tweeted and celebrated about him being 25 indicted, you have no knowledge of what he was indicted for?

2891 1 A There was a lot of indictments.

2 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I move to strike that. 3 MS. HOFFINGER: It is responsive, your Honor. 4 THE COURT: It's responsive.

5 Overruled. 6 BY MS. NECHELES:
7 Q Okay. 9 You don't have any idea?

10 A Business records. 11 Q And you know nothing about the business records, 12 right? 13 A I know nothing about his business records, no. 14 Why would I?

15 Q You know nothing about what he does, or does not know 16 about the business records, right?

17 A No.

18 Q And, Ms. Daniels, you have changed your story many 19 times.

20 And isn't it a fact that the reason you changed your 21 story many times is because you never had an affair with 22 President Trump, but realized that you could earn money by 23 saying you had an affair, and you have been doing that for 12 24 years?

25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection to the form.

8 You don't know what he was indicted for in this case?

2892 1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 MS. NECHELES: I have no further questions. 3 THE COURT: Any redirect? 4 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, I do.

5 Actually, Judge, may we approach for a moment? 6 THE COURT: Yes.

7 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 8 record.) 9 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I want to be careful, 10 given your prior rulings. 11 There are two exhibits I would like to put in, 12 Defense Exhibits, Ms. Necheles. J-2 and J-17, they are 13 specifically tweets that you -- she elicited that Ms. 14 Daniels wrote and put on her Twitter. But Ms. Necheles did 15 not elicit the tweets to which she was responding, which 16 are both threatening.

17 For example, J-2, she specifically asked about 18 it. It was responsive to a threat that she received on 19 that. In fact, the witness answered that, but Ms. Necheles 20 did not put it in evidence. 21 And so, frankly, we feel that the jury needs to 22 have the full context on those. I would like to admit one 23 of them. 24 On the second one, I would like to at least 25 elicit a question about what her tweet was in response to.

2893 1 Certainly, your Honor has ruled that these types 2 of threats can be elicited in a proper context. They have 3 cross-examined throughly on the fact that, one, it attempts 4 to undermine the threat in 2018 in the parking lot. These 5 are in some ways corroborative of that. 6 Second, they have cross-examined extensively 7 about the fact that she was only doing all of this to make 8 money, and even her testimony here, and her story is all 9 about money, undermining the fact that there are other 10 issues that have arisen in terms of the threats, and that 11 her whole reason to testify here is not purely about money 12 and that there have been other costs. 13 In fact, Ms. Necheles asked about that, and 19 yours.

20 Here is J-2 and then here is J-17. 21 MS. NECHELES: Thank you.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: We would like to elicit those. 23 This one here, defense counsel can't use it as 24 both a sword and shield. You can't fully -- you can't 25 elicit only what Ms. Daniels said and not show what it is 14 specifically about the money she made, all the money that 15 she had made off of this. 16 MS. NECHELES: Can I see it, the exhibit?

17 MS. HOFFINGER: It's J-2 and J-17.

18 Susan, I don't have a copy for you. It was 1 responsive to.

2 THE COURT: Is there any objection? 7 know, and she is just -- 8 THE COURT: Does that matter? 3 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I don't have a problem 4 eliciting that it is a response to a threat. I think that 5 they are not statements that are made by President Trump. 6 They are statements that are made by some stranger, you 9 I don't think that matters. You did go into 10 these a little bit, and you left the jury with a certain 11 impression. I think it's only fair that the jury should 12 have the full picture of what we are talking about. 13 I am going to allow it. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: In addition, I am going to seek 15 to show what's already in evidence, which is People's 408-B 16 from May of 2024, which we didn't display that says, if you 17 come after me, I am going after you.

18 Now, with this witness, given the 19 cross-examination that we have heard, I would like to 20 elicit what, if any, affect it has had on her, and what, if 21 anything, being involved in this case and telling her 22 account, what the affect has been on her family, the 23 economical costs and in terms of other costs. 24 And I think the door has not only been open, but 25 the door has been flung wide open at this point.

2894 2895 1 MR. STEINGLASS: August of 2023.

2 MS. NECHELES: We object to that. That would be 3 so highly prejudicial. 4 We asked about what she wrote and the money she 5 made. Now, they want to put into evidence a tweet that has 6 nothing to do with her. It had nothing to do with her.

7 They are insinuating it had something to do with her, 8 things strangers have done. 9 THE COURT: You did a very effective job on your 10 cross-examination of calling into question her motivation. 11 That, specifically, you have left the jury with the 12 impression again, you did a good job -- that she is doing 13 all of this for money. She sold her story for money. 14 I think it's fair for the People to try to 15 demonstrate that she has suffered injuries as a result of 16 that and what they look like.

17 I will allow it.

18 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor. 19 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 20 following occurred in open court.) 21 REDIRECT EXAMINATION
22 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 23 Q Almost good afternoon, Ms. Daniels. 24 How are you?

25 A Good.

2896 1 Q Defense counsel asked you quite a lot of questions 2 yesterday, and perhaps today as well, questioning whether fear 3 was any part of your motivation in entering into the NDA. 4 Do you remember any of those questions?

5 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 6 Those weren't my questions.

7 THE COURT: Overruled. 8 Q Now, you said in response to questions from defense 9 counsel that you entered into the NDA because of advice from an 10 attorney. 11 Do you remember that?

12 A Yes. 13 Q And that your attorney friend said something to you 14 about hiding in plain view?

15 A Yes. 16 Q Can you explain that a little bit, what that term 17 meant, hiding in plain view?

18 What your understanding is, briefly? 19 A And it was not the attorney who was representing me.

20 This is a friend who was just trying to give me advice. And 21 his friends in the military used the term, get high, stay high.

22 And it just means, if you are out in the open, you are 23 safer; hiding in plain sight, being out in the open. That 24 something won't happen to you if everyone is looking at you.

25 Q Okay.

2897 1 And so, part of your motivation to enter into the NDA
2 was to make sure this was all documented to keep you safe? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you were also happy to take the money, you are not 5 saying that you were not happy to take the money, right? 6 A No. We are all happy to take money. It was just a 7 bonus.

13 Q And that was a document that you hadn't prepared 15 A No. 16 Q And some of it is hard for you to understand?

17 A Yeah.

18 Q There was no lawsuit pending at the time, right? 19 Did you threaten to sue Mr. Trump or no?

20 A No. 21 Q Now, defense counsel on Tuesday, two days ago, asked 22 you to read some texts between yourself -- withdrawn. 23 Asked you to read some texts between Gina Rodriguez 24 and someone whose name was Dylan, who you mentioned you didn't 25 know.

11 Do you recall that?

12 A Yes. 14 yourself, right?

10 language in that document.

8 Q Now, there was a question today, Ms. Necheles showed 9 you the NDA, and she walked you through a lot of the legal 2898 1 Do you remember that?

2 A Yes. 3 Q And those texts were from June 28, 2016. 4 Do you remember that?

5 A Yes. 6 Q And she had you read from some texts --
24 ready to talk?

25 Do you remember that?

7 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up People's 171-A, 8 please, in evidence. 9 And can you pull up, please, the box where Dylan 10 says, I thought she denounced it previously. 11 Q Do you see that box?

12 MS. HOFFINGER: And then the two boxes below 13 that. Maybe you can highlight the two boxes below that. 14 These were from June 28th of 2016.

15 I am sorry. Let's do it one box at a time. 16 Q You see the box, I think it's ending in -- it says, 17 Fox 38904, I have her.

18 Do you see that box? 19 And do you remember she asked you to read the box that 20 says, I have her? 21 A Yes.

22 MS. HOFFINGER: Put up the next box now. 23 Q And do you remember she asked you to read, is she 2899 1 A Yes.

3 please? 4 Q And do you see, Dylan asked a question, I thought she 18 A I don't think so. 19 Q You can take that down.

21 about the In Touch article and you indicated that it was a very 22 light article, is that right, for entertainment purposes? 24 MS. HOFFINGER: And can we show just to the 25 witness, please, and to counsel and to the Court, the 2 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you put up the next box, 5 denounced it previously? 6 Do you remember she had you read that box?

7 A Yes. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's go to the next one, please. 9 Q And you see she asked you to read that box that said, 10 she said she'll do it under two conditions? 11 A Yes.

12 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, lets look at the next box. 13 The very next box. 14 There is a reply from Gina.

15 Can you highlight where she said, she never did? 16 Q Did she ask you to read that box where she said, she 17 never did?

20 Now, defense counsel asked you a lot of questions 23 A Yes.

2900 1 second page of that page two of 29?

2 Actually, we may not have it. It is J-28. It's 3 a Defense Exhibit.

5 please. The next page.

7 Q Do you see at the bottom where it says, this interview 8 has been lightly edited?

10 A Yes. 11 Q Did Ms. Necheles ask you about that?

12 A No.

15 Q Now, Ms. Necheles also asked you a lot of questions 16 about your 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper.

17 Do you remember that?

18 A Yes. 19 Q And she put up for you J-12. She asked you a lot of 20 questions about it. 21 She asked you a lot of questions about what you did 22 and didn't say in 2018 in some interviews. 23 Do you remember that? 24 A Yes.

25 Q And she asked you about your interview with Anderson Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates, RPR, CCR, RSA
9 Did you see that?

14 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. 13 Q Thank you.

4 Just for the witness and counsel and the Court, 6 Could you display the next page?

2901 1 Cooper.

2 Now, you didn't tell every single detail to Anderson 3 Cooper, did you? 4 A No. 5 Q But you mentioned a lot of the details in that 6 interview with him, didn't you?

7 MS. NECHELES: Objection to the leading, your 10 Q Well, there was a lot of back and forth in that 11 interview between yourself and Anderson Cooper?

12 A Yes. It was very long.

13 Q And defense counsel showed you that J-12, the 60 14 Minutes interview, and asked you some questions about it? 15 A Yes.

17 now, your Honor.

16 MS. HOFFINGER: We would offer that in evidence 18 THE COURT: Any objections? 19 MS. NECHELES: Yes, your Honor. 20 THE COURT: What's the objection. 21 MS. NECHELES: It's hearsay, statements --
22 THE COURT: Approach.

23 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 24 record.) 25 THE COURT: What does that have to do with the 9 THE COURT: Sustained. 8 Honor.

1 interview?

2 What is it for?

2902 3 MS. HOFFINGER: A prior inconsistent statement. 4 They have spent a long time talking about all 5 kinds of inconsistencies. The witness clearly said she 6 didn't tell every detail. There are a lot of details in 7 there which she told him.

12 to her and asked her all sorts of questions. I am 13 surprised she would object to it being admitted at this 14 point.

19 These were made in 2008, when she is selling her 20 story. 21 THE COURT: They are the same documents. It is 22 the same document you used to impeach her as inconsistent.

25 THE COURT: Direct me to it. Direct me to the 10 MS. NECHELES: A prior consistent statement? 11 MS. HOFFINGER: Ms. Necheles showed the article 15 MS. NECHELES: I showed it under the clear rules 16 that apply to prior inconsistent statements. Prior 17 consistent statements are only admissible if they were 18 made at the time before there was a motive for fabrication.

23 MS. NECHELES: I would rely on People v. Davis, a 24 Court of Appeal case, which --
8 It is a prior consistent statement to rebut that 9 it is a recent fabrication.

2903 1 relevant section.

2 MS. NECHELES: Okay. I need Gedalia for that. 3 MR. STEINGLASS: Do you have a copy for us? 4 MS. NECHELES: No, I don't. And it's 44 N.Y. 2d.

5 269. 6 MR. STERN: So, it starts over here. It has to 7 be before the motive to fabricate started, and particularly 8 this paragraph, if the Defense argue it was fabricated from 9 the beginning.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, it contextualizes the 11 so-called inconsistency they asked about.

17 THE COURT: I can't read and listen to you guys 18 at the same time. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: I apologize.

20 When you are done, I wanted to add one thing. 21 THE COURT: I understand what the decision says, 22 and it does stand with what you are saying. 23 I am asking -- 24 MS. HOFFINGER: If you are admitting it --
25 THE COURT: I haven't decided yet.

12 It's unfairly giving the jury an unfair 13 impression so it contextualizes it. It shows the entire 14 context given that Ms. Necheles went through and asked a 15 number of questions about what was told or not told to 16 Anderson Cooper.

2904 1 MS. HOFFINGER: The question is, the motive to 2 fabricate. They indicated her motive to fabricate was 3 after 2008. It's more recently. It's -- the 4 indictments -- it's going on these tours. It doesn't have 5 to predate every motive to fabricate. She -- they brought 6 up much later the alleged notice to fabricate.

7 MS. NECHELES: I would say that's not correct.

19 context.

20 MS. HOFFINGER: I should be able to ask what 21 things she did tell him, Anderson Cooper. She didn't tell 24 I should be able to do exactly what Ms. Necheles 25 did.

10 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we bring out some of details 11 that are consistent to rebut the inference that out of 12 context there are these inconsistencies? 13 THE COURT: You can go back to anything that was 14 taken out of context and address it in full context.

15 MS. HOFFINGER: I can ask her all the things she 16 did tell.

17 THE COURT: No. No. You can go back and address 18 the things that were taken out of context and put them in 22 him all the details. There was a number of details that 23 were asked and answered that she testified to here.

8 THE COURT: I am going to run on the side of the 9 caution and deny the application.

2905 1 MS. NECHELES: That's not the law.

2 MS. HOFFINGER: I should be able to ask questions 3 about what was told. 4 THE COURT: All right.

6 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 10 BY MS. HOFFINGER: 11 Q Ms. Necheles asked about certain things that you 12 didn't tell Anderson Cooper at the time. 13 Do you remember that? 14 A Yes.

15 Q But there were many things that you did tell Anderson 16 Cooper, did you not?

17 MS. NECHELES: Objection.

18 THE COURT: Overruled. 19 Q And in terms of the context, you did tell Anderson 20 Cooper that you had sex with Mr. Trump in the hotel room? 21 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

22 THE COURT: Overruled. 23 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I think this is not 24 what I asked.

25 THE COURT: Overruled.

8 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger, you can clarify to the 9 extent that was discussed and to that extent only. 7 following occurred in open court.)
5 Let's continue. Step back.

2906 3 A Yes. 4 Q And, for example, you told him that Mr. Trump told 5 you -- never told you to keep it confidential? 6 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: Please approach. 8 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the 9 record.)
23 MS. NECHELES: These are not ones I addressed. 24 She is going to things that have nothing to do 25 with what I addressed. I agree, if I raised an issue, if 10 MS. NECHELES: These are none of the things I 11 asked about. She is just going through, generally, things 12 that are consistent with what she testified about. I never 13 asked about this. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: I am filling out, around Ms.

15 Necheles' questions. I only have a few. Not every single 16 thing.

17 THE COURT: What makes it a little bit unique is 18 that she is not trying to use a prior consistent statement. 19 She is using the same exact document that you used and you 20 left the jury with a certain impression. 21 Now, I don't want you to go full board and try to 22 rehabilitate the prior inconsistent statements.

1 Q And you did also provide details of what happened in 2 the room, didn't you?

2907 18 A I did. 19 MS. HOFFINGER: I would like you, please, 20 actually, I think we have -- I have the -- can we show J-2 21 just to the witness, the Court and to counsel, please.

22 Q So, we are showing you J-2, which is an exhibit that 23 Ms. Necheles showed you, and asked you some questions about. 24 Do you remember that?

25 A Yes.

7 before and that's improper. 8 MS. HOFFINGER: There were details. 9 THE COURT: Just go back and establish that she 10 established a lot of details and leave it at that. 11 MS. HOFFINGER: All right, your Honor.

12 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the 13 following occurred in open court.) 14 BY MS. HOFFINGER:
15 Q So, Ms. Daniels, you did tell Anderson Cooper about a 16 lot of the details of what happened in the room and in your 17 other encounters with Mr. Trump, correct?

1 you told him the sky was blue, and I left off that on some 2 days it was cloudy -- 3 THE COURT: You did leave the impression that she 4 left out a lot of details.

5 MS. NECHELES: Yes. She wants to go back and say 6 the details I never mentioned were actually things she said 1 Q And she asked you some questions about your saying, I
2908 2 will dance down the street when he is, quote, selected. 3 Do you remember those questions? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And do you remember responding that you were -- you 6 said that you were only responding and using the same words as 7 the person who had tweeted it to you? 9 A Yes.

10 MS. HOFFINGER: I offer that into evidence, your 11 Honor.

12 MS. NECHELES: No objection. 13 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence. 14 MS. HOFFINGER: Can you put that up on the screen 15 for everyone, please? 16 Can you blowup the bottom tweet, please, meaning 17 the first tweet.

18 Q Was this the tweet that you were responding to when 19 you used the term, selected?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And in this tweet, do you know who it was who posted 22 this tweet on your Twitter page? 23 A Are you asking if I know this person personally? 24 No.

25 Q Did you know who the person was?

1 A No.

2909 2 Q This is an example of people who sometimes show up and 3 put tweets on your Twitter page? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And this person called you a disgusting degenerate 6 prostitute?

7 A Yes. 8 Q And did this person also say, good luck walking down 11 Q What you did you understand that to mean, good luck 12 walking down the street after this? 13 A That I wouldn't be safe going in public anymore. 14 Q And did this person also tweet, no wonder Glen left 15 you? 16 A Yes.

17 Q What did you understand that to mean?

18 A There is no surprise that my daughter's father left. 19 Q And this tweet was dated March 21st -- sorry --
20 March 18th of 2023? 21 A Yes.

22 Q And then you responded to that, is that right? 23 A That's correct. 24 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down, now.

25 Can you now show the witness please, J-17?

9 the streets after this?

10 A Yes.

2910 1 Just to the witness, counsel and the parties, 2 please.

20 Q Are these two tweets examples of some of the tweets 6 A Yes.

7 Q And she didn't ask you at all about the original tweet 8 that you were responding to, is that right? 9 A That's correct.

10 Q Is this another example of somebody that showed up on 11 your Twitter page saying something about you that you responded 12 to? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And this was back in December of 2022, is that right?

15 A Yes. 16 Q And the tweet on this page that you were responding 17 to, was -- were you responding to someone calling you an aging 18 harlot? 19 A Yes.

21 that you have received from random individuals in relation to 22 things that you have said publicly about Mr. Trump? 23 A Yes. These are tame actually. 24 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down, now.

25 Can we please show in evidence to everyone, 5 Do you remember that?

3 Q Do you recall Ms. Necheles showing you this tweet of 4 yours and asking you a question about your response.

2911 1 People's Exhibit 408-B.

2 Q Ms. Daniels, this tweet by Mr. Trump was August 4th of 3 2023? 4 A Yes.

5 Q And were you aware of this Truth Social post from 7 A Yes. Sorry. 8 Q Who did you understand Mr. Trump was directing this to 9 at the time?

10 A I wasn't sure, but I thought it was me. 11 Q In what way?

12 A Um, do you want me to read it? 13 Q No. You can read it. 14 A Okay.

15 Because it says, if you go after me, I am coming after 16 you, and this was right around the same time that he filed in 17 Florida, so it seemed to be connected, but I am not sure.

18 Q That he filed in Florida the proceeding against you on 19 the legal fees?

20 A Yes. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. Thank 22 you. 23 Q By the way, defense counsel asked you some questions 24 about whether you felt you were responsible for the charges in 25 this case.

6 Mr. Trump when it came out?

1 Do you remember that?

2912 2 A Yes. 3 Q You didn't testify in the Grand Jury in this case, did 4 you?

5 A I did not. 6 Q So you had nothing to do with the charges in this case 7 initially, did you? 8 A I did not. 9 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Overruled. I will allow. 11 Q I am sorry. Your answer?

12 A I did not. 13 Q Now, Ms. Necheles asked you at the end of her 14 questioning about the fact that you didn't know anything about 15 the business records in this case, meaning Mr. Trump's business 16 records.

17 Do you remember those questions?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Whether you knew anything about the repayments or the 20 reimbursements or any of the business records. 21 Do you remember that?

22 A Yes. 23 Q And you said you didn't know anything directly, is 24 that right?

25 A Yes.

2913 1 Q Do you recall -- you recall the lawsuit that you 2 filed, your lawyers filed against Mr. Trump to get out of the 3 NDA? 4 Do you remember that?

5 A Yes. 6 Q And do you remember that Mr. Trump was represented by 7 counsel in that case? 8 A Yes. 9 Q And do you recall that his attorneys, Mr. Trump's 10 attorney, in court papers filed in June of 2018, confirmed that 11 Donald Trump in 2017 had reimbursed Michael Cohen's company, 12 Essential Consultants, for the 130,000 that was paid to you? 13 A Yes. I saw that. 14 Q So that was confirmed in Mr. Trump lawyer's submitted 15 court papers, correct? 16 A Correct.

17 Q Now, defense counsel asked you a whole lot of 18 questions regarding your making money about telling lies about 19 Mr. Trump.

20 Do you remember that? 21 A Yes.

22 Q Have you been telling lies about Mr. Trump or the 23 truth about Mr. Trump? 24 A The truth.

5 A Yes.

15 Q Let me ask you a question: Ms. Daniels, on balance, 16 has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with 17 Mr. Trump had a net positive or a net negative in your life?

18 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor. 19 THE COURT: Overruled.

20 A Negative. 21 MS. HOFFINGER: Nothing further.

22 Thank you. 23 THE COURT: Any recross? 24 MS. NECHELES: Yes.

25 RECROSS-EXAMINATION
6 Q Can you explain that?

7 A I have had to higher security, take extra precautions, 8 tutors for my daughter, had to move my daughter to a safe place 9 to live. I had to move a couple of times.

10 And I lost -- I didn't -- I lost -- had a judgment on 11 automatic attorney fees because my case from the NDA was thrown 12 out. And I appealed it, and it was dismissed again. So 13 attorney's fees are automatically awarded in those kinds of 14 instances.

2 you money, and I think you said it also cost you a lot of 3 money.

15 A Yes. 16 Q And you are calling whoever asked this Twitter, or 17 posted this Twitter names, right?

So, I think you said "corporate culture at The Trump 17 Organization?"

12 Q. Is that your only focus? 13 A. I tried to have it be my only focus. 14 Q. When you started the job in January 2017, did you have 15 job training or orientation? 16 A. Not formally, no.

17 Q. How did you learn how to do your job?

18 A. The first few months I tried to really observe people 19 that had been close to him, so people like Hope and John and 20 Keith and Dan, and learn his preferences. 21 Then, it was just a lot of on-the-job training. You 22 know, we really started full force day one. So just trying to 23 do my best to keep up. 24 Q. When you say Hope and John and Keith and Dan, are you 25 referring to Hope Hicks, John McEntee, Dan Scavino and Keith 7 A. Yes. Special Assistant to the President and Executive 8 Assistant to the President.

2985 1 Schiller?

2 A. Yes. 3 Q. Was it your understanding those four individuals had 4 previously worked with Mr. Trump? 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Did you also make an effort to learn Mr. Trump's 7 preferences by observing him while you were sitting in the Outer 8 Oval? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. How long did you end up working in the White House? 11 A. Until August 2019. 12 Q. Is that a total of two and a half years? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Did you have the same job in the White House the whole 15 time? 16 A. The same job, yes. But at some point my title changed 17 to Special Assistant to the President and Director of Oval 18 Office Operations. 19 Q. Did you sit at the same desk in the Outer Oval the 20 entire two and a half years you were in the White House? 21 A. I switched desks at some point. Like I said, there 22 were two desks there. At some point, I switched to the desk 23 that was further away, but it had a line of sight to the 24 Resolute Desk. That was more helpful to kind -- for the 25 President and I to communicate.

2986 1 Q. And for those who may not know, what is the Resolute 2 Desk? 3 A. That is the desk where the President sits in the Oval 4 Office. 5 Q. After working closely with Mr. Trump for two and a half 6 years, did you develop an understanding of his work habits? 7 A. I did, yes. 8 Q. How about list preferences? 9 A. I hope so.

10 Q. How about Mr. Trump's relationships and contacts? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Are you familiar with the way that he used social 13 media? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Are you familiar with the way that he interacted with 16 others at the White House? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And are you familiar with the way that he interacted 19 with his family? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. So, turning now to his work habits, what was Mr. 22 Trump's preferred method of communication? 23 A. He liked speaking with people in person or on the 24 phone. 25 Q. And about how many calls did Mr. Trump typically take 2987 1 in a day?

2 A. A lot. 3 Q. Do you know, approximately, when he started taking 4 calls in the day? 7 Q. And when would he stop taking calls at the end of the 8 day? 9 A. Again, it depended. I recall times he would be on the 10 phone late into the night after I went to bed, so I always felt 11 guilty about that.

15 A. There is a rather complicated process. If the 16 President is in the Oval Office and someone calls in and they 17 had my desk phone number, they could just call that number. If 18 the President was available, I would patch them through. 19 If someone was calling in, John Smith, you know, off 20 the street and just calling 1-800 White House, obviously, they 21 wouldn't be patched through to the Oval Office.

22 But there were operators that took calls and then kind 23 of determined if that person was someone that needed to get 24 patched through either to myself or other members of the 25 President's staff.

12 Q. How did you call the President at work? Can anybody 13 call the President of the United States. Is this a more 14 complicated process?

5 A. I remember times where, you know, I knew he was taking 6 calls as early as 6 in the morning.

2988 1 There were also calls made by the situation room.

2 Calls that were more secure that might need to be on a secure 3 line. People might call through the situation room. 4 Q. Once the White House operators had screened calls, did 5 you see the calls that came to you after that? 6 A. I am sorry. 7 Q. Let me say that again. 8 After the calls were screened, did they typically come 9 to you before going to Mr. Trump?

10 A. If he was in the Oval Office, yes. 11 Q. So you were able to see much of the many people that he 12 spoke to while he was there in 2017? 14 Q. Did Mr. Trump use a computer? 15 A. Not to my knowledge. 16 Q. Did Mr. Trump have an email account? 17 A. Not to my knowledge.

18 Q. Did Mr. Trump prefer electronic documents or hard copy 19 documents? 20 A. He liked hard copy documents. 21 Q. And did Mr. Trump like to read? 22 A. Yes. 23 Q. Did his role in 2017 require a lot of reading? 24 A. It did, yes. 25 Q. Where did he actually do his work?

13 A. Yes.

2989 1 A. After a few weeks, he kind of moved his working space 2 into a room off of the side of the Oval Office, known as the 3 dining room. He really just, I remember, wanted to keep the 4 Resolute Desk very pristine and kind of keep that more for 5 meetings. 6 Then he spent most of the time when he was working, 7 reading, going over documents in the dining room. And that was 8 really his working office. 9 Q. Were the hard copy documents that he liked to review 10 kept in the dining room? 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Was there an organization system there? 13 A. To my understanding, the President knew where things 14 were and he kept it organized. But he did have a lot of papers 15 and often brought things back and forth to his residence or Air 16 Force One or Marine One. I thought he always knew where things 17 were.

18 Q. In general, is he the type of person who would pay 19 attention to details? 20 A. In my experience, yes. 21 Q. How about his signature practices? Did he have to sign 22 things that you saw in that first year in 2017? 23 A. He did. 24 Q. Did he use an automated signature or prefer to sign 25 himself?

2990 1 A. He preferred to sign things himself.

2 Q. That was signing by hand? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. Was there a particular style of pen he liked to use? 5 A. My recollection is he liked to use a Sharpie or a 6 felt-tip pen. 7 Q. Based on working with him for two and a half years, can 8 you recognize Mr. Trump's signature? 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Did Mr. Trump have to review and sign a lot of 11 documents that year in 2017? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. In your experience, did he typically read things before 14 signing them? 15 A. Yes. 16 Q. Do you know if Mr. Trump used social media while he was 17 in the White House?

18 A. He did, yes. 19 Q. What was the primary social media platform that he 20 used? 21 A. Twitter. 22 Q. Is that now called something else? 23 A. X. 24 Q. Do you know what Mr. Trump's Twitter handle was in 25 2017?

2991

1 A. @realdonaldtrump.
2 Q. Did Mr. Trump post tweets himself using that Twitter 3 handle?

4 A. He did, yes.
5 Q. Did anyone else have access to the @realdonaldtrump 6 Twitter account in 2017? 7 A. It's my understanding that Dan Scavino had access to 8 it. 9 Q. Was there anybody other than Mr. Trump and Mr. Scavino?

10 A. Not to my knowledge. 11 Q. In the two and a half years when you worked with Mr. 12 Trump, did you ever see Mr. Scavino post a tweet without Mr. 13 Trump's approval? 14 A. I did not see Dan post, I didn't see the President or 15 Dan ever post a single tweet. Not to my knowledge. 16 If there was a video recap of an event or something 17 that might have gone out without the President's approval, it's 18 my understanding and recollection that the President did like to 19 see the tweets that went out. 20 Q. Do you know if that account was password protected? 21 A. I believe so, yes. 22 Q. Did you ever work directly with Mr. Trump on his 23 Twitter posts? 24 A. Once in a while, if Dan wasn't available, the President 25 would call me and dictate a tweet to me. I would quickly 2992 1 scribble it down and then go back to my computer and type it up 2 so that the President could actually read it because he wasn't 3 able to read my handwriting. Sometimes print it back out, give 4 it to him so he could look over it. It just depended if he put 9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Then you would print a hard copy document?
11 A. Yes. 12 Q. And take that in for him to review? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Would he then edit sometimes the hard copy printout? 15 A. Sometimes, yes. 16 Q. Would he ask you to make additional changes and then 17 show it to him?

18 A. Sometimes. 19 Q. Did he have any particular preferences when it came to 20 the way that he wrote social media posts? 21 A. My recollection is that there were certain words that 22 he liked to capitalize. Words like "country." And he liked to 23 use exclamation points. 24 Q. Did he also periodically correct other punctuation, 25 like commas or comma locations?

5 it out or held onto it or made edits to. That was the extent of 6 it. 7 Q. He would dictate a tweet to you, then you would go type 8 it up on your computer?

2993 1 A. It's my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford 2 comma. 3 Q. Now, during that first year in the White House in 2017, 4 would you describe that as a transition period, that first year 5 that Mr. Trump was in the White House? 6 A. Yes. I think, you know, the first year of any 7 administration is a transition year. We were all trying to 8 learn our way around and, you know, do the best work we could 9 for the American people.

10 Q. And you and others were doing things for the first time 11 that year? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And was Mr. Trump busy that year? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Was he constantly being pulled in a lot of different 16 directions? 17 A. Yes.

18 Q. Based on your experience, were there things he 19 overlooked or forgot during that period? Was he still attentive 20 to the things that were brought to his attention? 21 A. My understanding is he was attentive to things that 22 were brought to his attention. 23 Q. During that first year in the White House, in 2017, 24 when things were in transition, did you coordinate with The 25 Trump Organization?

1 A. On some things, yes.

2994 2 Q. Did you ever have questions for employees at The Trump 4 A. Yes.

5 Q. And did Trump Organization employees ever have 6 questions for you?

7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Who was your main point of contact at The Trump 9 Organization in 2017?

10 A. Rhona Graff. 11 Q. And, again, that was Mr. Trump's Trump Organization's 12 Executive Assistant? 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. And she remained at The Trump Organization after 15 Mr. Trump moved to Washington D.C.? 16 A. Yes.

17 Q. When Trump Organization employees had questions for 18 Mr. Trump, did you pass those along? 19 A. Yes, sometimes.

20 Q. Were there ever times that you didn't pass along 21 something you were asked to?

22 A. No, but it could have been they asked somebody else. 23 Q. When Mr. Trump had questions for Trump Organization 25 A. Yes.

24 employees, did you pass those along?

3 Organization?

2995 1 Q. What types of things did you coordinate with Ms. Graff 2 on during that year in 2017. Did you coordinate on Mr. Trump's 3 contacts? 4 A. Yes, we did. 5 Q. How about calls to and from Mr. Trump? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. How about Mr. Trump's calendar? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. Mr. Trump's travel schedule?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. Mr. Trump's golf schedule? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. How about the First Family's travel? 14 A. Yes. 15 Q. Personal mail for Mr. Trump? 16 A. Yes. 17 Q. What other logistical issues?

18 A. Such as? 19 Q. For example, if there was an issue getting through on a 20 particular number or other things that were lost in translation, 21 anything like that? 22 A. Sure. Yes. 23 Q. Overall, how frequently were you in touch with The 24 Trump Organization in 20127? 25 A. Especially the first few months, I think Rhona and I
2996 1 spoke at least weekly. Sometimes daily. But that trickled off 2 as I kind of grew in the role and the contacts kind of shifted 3 over to more of the White House side. 4 Q. And, in total, how many communications would you say 5 you had with The Trump Organization in 2017, a rough estimate? 6 Is it fair to say it was dozens of communications?

7 A. Dozens. 8 Q. Now, one of the things you just mentioned was 9 Mr. Trump's contacts; right?

10 A. Yes. 11 Q. And did you get guidance from Ms. Graff on contacts 12 that were important to Mr. Trump? 13 A. Yes. 14 MS. MANGOLD: Can we show the jury what is in 15 evidence as People's Exhibit 68. And can we blow up the 16 top portion of the page. All of the portions.

23 So, when I got to the White House, I, naively, assumed that 24 the operators kind of had everybody's phone number, and that is 25 not the case. They didn't have, really, any phone numbers.

 Laurie Eisenberg, CSR, RPR
 Senior Court Reporter 2999 1 And so, the President would often ask, you know, call John 2 Smith, call so and so, and I didn't have their phone numbers. 3 So, I would call Rhona all the time, asking for phone 4 numbers for people, and that's something -- I guess, four days 5 in, I just asked her to put together a list for me that she 6 thought would be helpful of people that he either spoke to 7 often or might want to speak to. 8 Q If you look at the top email on the chain, how did 9 Ms. Graff respond?

18 Q And how did you learn that they were handled by 19 checks?

20 A Checks came to the White House -- I'm sorry. Checks 21 were sent from The Trump Organization to an employee at the 22 White House, and I brought them in for the President to sign. 23 Q Do you know what employee the checks were sent to? 24 A They were originally sent to Keith Schiller, and then, 25 later, they were sent to me.

5 MS. MANGOLD: Can we turn now to the attachment 6 to the second page of the PDF?

7 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 8 Q What is this? 9 A This is the cover of The New York Times, and it's the 10 President boarding Air Force One for the first time. 11 Q This is the newspaper clip that Mr. Trump asked you to 12 send to both his family and Mr. Weisselberg?

1 Q And what did you do when you received the checks?

3011 2 A The checks came in a FedEx envelope. Um, so I opened 3 the envelope. And inside was a manila folder with a stack of 4 checks. And I brought the manila folder in to the President for 5 him to sign.

11 Q And the checks that you received from Mr. Schiller, 12 you received unsigned checks; is that right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q You said you brought the checks in to Mr. Trump for 15 his signature? 16 A Yes.

17 Q How frequently did you receive a package of checks for 18 Mr. Trump to sign? 19 A I don't recall how frequently, but it was, um, 20 consistent. Maybe twice a month? 21 Q And how many checks, approximately, came in a packet?

22 A It depended. Sometimes there was -- sometimes there 23 was one. Sometimes there was a stack, maybe half-an-inch thick. 24 I never counted them.

25 Q Was it ever more than half-an-inch thick or was it 10 sometimes.

8 A Um, I didn't really dig around in the folder, but, um, 9 I believe there were invoices attached to some of the checks 6 Q And was there anything else besides checks that were 7 contained in the manila folder?

3012 1 typically smaller?

2 A I don't remember. 3 Q Now, did you ever see Mr. Trump sign checks in his 4 office?

5 A Sometimes, yes. 6 Q Did Mr. Trump individually sign each check by hand?

7 A To my knowledge, the ones that I saw him sign. 8 I can't speak to the ones that I didn't see him sign. 9 Q And what happened after Mr. Trump signed the checks?

10 A He would give the folder back to me, and I would put 11 it in a pre-labeled FedEx envelope and send it back to The 12 Trump Organization. 13 Q Did the pre-labeled return envelope come with the 14 original FedEx with the checks?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Do you recall if there was ever a time where Mr. Trump 20 didn't send back every single check in a packet? 21 A Um, no, I don't recall a specific time.

22 Q Do you remember if Mr. Trump ever had questions on -- 23 about the checks? 24 A Um, I think I remember, maybe, a couple times him 25 having a question about a check and then calling Allen -- Allen 16 Q And you were the one that sent that back to The Trump 17 Organization?

15 A Yes.

3013 1 Weisselberg or somebody else in the Trump Organization to ask 2 for clarification. 3 Q All right. 4 MS. MANGOLD: Can you please show the jury what is 5 in evidence as People's Exhibit 73? 6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MS. MANGOLD: Could you blow up the top portion 18 works." Winking face. 19 Q Can we turn -- is there an attachment to this email?

20 A Yes. 21 MS. MANGOLD: Can you please flip to Page 2 of 22 the PDF? 23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 24 Q Focus on -- yep, that portion of the page.

17 A "M: Here is the FedEx label you requested. Hope it 8 of that document?

3014 1 A Yes. It's a FedEx label.

2 Q Who is the FedEx label to? 3 A Rebecca Manochio 4 Q What is the address --
5 A The Trump -- 6 Q Sorry.

8 A I'm sorry?

10 A The Trump Organization, 725 Fifth Avenue, 26th floor, 11 New York, New York.

12 Q Do you see who the -- I don't know how to describe 13 this. 14 The return recipient is in the top-left corner.

15 A Yes. 16 Keith Schiller.

17 Q Mr. Schiller was the one who received the checks that 18 you, ultimately, brought in to Mr. Trump to sign? 19 A At this time, yes.

20 Q Can you describe for the jury the contexts around this 21 email?

22 A Um, I probably had misplaced the return package with 23 the pre-paid label, and so I was just requesting a new one. 24 Q And this is in connection with checks for Mr. Trump to 25 sign or checks that he had signed?

9 Q What is the address provided for Ms. Manochio? 7 -- provided for Ms. Manochio?

1 A Probably.

2 Q Did you ever request FedEx labels from The Trump 4 A Not to my recollection.

18 Q Is this a reference to the personal checks that we 19 were just talking about?

20 A Probably. 21 MS. MANGOLD: And can we take that down?

22 Q Did Trump Organization employees ever have other 23 questions for Mr. Trump about his personal expenses, unrelated 24 to the checks?

25 A I -- I don't know the answer to that.

3015 3 Organization for any other reason?

5 MS. MANGOLD: All right. 6 Can we please show Ms. Westerhout and the jury 7 what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 76? 8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 9 Q Do you recognize this?

10 A Yes. It's an email from me to Rhona Graff. 11 Q What's the date?

12 A July 18, 2017. 13 Q What's the subject? 14 A "Checks."
15 Q And can you read the content to the jury? 16 A "R. Can you have someone send me a FedEx label to send 17 back the checks the President just signed?"
3016 1 Q There were no one-off questions about Mr. Trump's 2 personal expenses that came through you? 3 A Oh. Yes. 4 MS. MANGOLD: Can we show the jury what's in 20 MS. MANGOLD: Can you flip to the second page of 21 the PDF?

22 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 23 Q Do you recognize this? 24 A Yes.

25 Q What is this?

6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MS. MANGOLD: Can we blow up the top of the 8 email? 9 Q Do you recognize this?

10 A Yes. It's an email from me to Rhona Graff. 11 Q What's the date?

12 A February 21, 2017. 13 Q What's the subject? 14 A "Winged Foot Golf Club."
15 Q Do you know what the Winged Foot Golf Club is? 16 A I believe it's a golf club.

17 Q Can you read the content of the email to the jury?

18 A "Rhona. Can you help me with this? See attached. 19 Thanks. Let me know if I should call them directly."
5 evidence as People's 71, please?

3017 1 A This is an invoice.

2 Q What is it an invoice for? 3 A For the President's annual dues to the Winged Foot 4 Golf Club.

19 know whose handwriting that is?

20 A I believe that's Rhona Graff's. 21 Q Can you read what's written in Ms. Graff's writing?

22 A "Dear President, If Winged Foot will allow me to 23 suspend your membership for four or eight years, do you want me 24 to look into it, or do you want to continue paying annual dues

25 and the food minimum?" I believe that's just "RG".
7 Q Is there two sets of handwriting?

6 A Yes. 5 Q Do you see handwriting on the document?

8 A Yes. 9 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please blow up the bottom 10 half of the page? 11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 Q Do you recognize both sets of handwriting on the page? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And is the amount of the invoice also shown here?

15 A Yes. 16 Q What is the total amount of the invoice?

17 A $6,974.01.

18 Q Looking now at the handwriting towards the top, do you 3018 1 Q Do you see handwriting below that?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Whose is that? 4 A That's the President.

5 Q Do you know what type of pen was used for the 6 President's handwriting?

7 A It looks to be a Sharpie. 8 Q What's written below the note in Mr. Trump's 10 A "Hey." 11 Q Is there something else written in the President's 12 handwriting? 13 A Yes. 14 "ASAP. Okay."
15 Q Is there another marking next to "Okay"? 16 A Yes. The shortened signature.

17 Q What is your recollection or understanding of what was 18 happening in this email exchange? 19 A Um, this one -- obviously, he wouldn't really be able 20 to use a membership of this golf club while he was in office, 21 so I believe Rhona was asking if she wanted him to suspend his 22 membership or pay the annual dues. 23 Q Were you able to pass that question along to Mr. Trump 24 for his evaluation or decision?

25 A Um, this was included in the stack of checks. So, by 9 handwriting?

3019 3 Q And was it your understanding that Mr. Trump 4 individually approved the amount of this invoice?

5 A Yes. 6 MS. MANGOLD: Can we now show the jury what is in 16 Q Was it dated, the email?

17 A June 20, 2017.

18 Q What's the subject line? 19 A "Photo."
20 Q Can you read the content to the jury? 21 A "This is what I have."
22 Q Do you remember what this email pertained to? 23 A Yes. I believe this was in relation to a photograph 24 that Mr. Trump -- that President Trump wanted to put in a frame 25 to put behind his desk in the Oval Office.

10 A Yes. It's an email exchange between Rhona and myself. 11 Q Can we focus on the bottom half of this page, please?

12 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 13 Q Looking now at the email at the bottom of this email 14 on the chain, who is that from and to?

15 A From me, to Rhona.

8 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.) 9 Q Do you recognize this? 7 evidence as People's Exhibit 75?

1 -- yes. I passed it along in the sense that I gave him this 2 note.

3020 1 So, behind the Resolute Desk, there was a little credenza; 2 and as time went on, he put pictures of his family behind him. 3 Q Can you read Ms. Graff's response to you about that in 4 the email chain?

5 A "Wow. I never saw this one. And in color too. It's not 6 one of the photos I gave to Lara Trump. I'm trying to find out 7 what happened to those. In answer to your question, however, I
11 A "If you don't mind doing that, that would be 12 wonderful. He did mention a Tiffany frame." 13 Q Can you read Ms. Graff's response? 14 A It says: "Please note that the frames are on the 15 pricey side. About $650 minus 15 percent discount. Does DJT 16 want to spend that much?"
17 Q What do you understand "the frames" were "on the 18 pricey side" to mean? 19 A That they were more expensive.

20 Q When it says, "Does DJT want to spend that much?", who 21 does "DJT" refer to?

22 A President Trump. 23 Q In your experience, is this the type of thing 24 Mr. Trump would want to weigh in on?

25 A I don't recall any other instances of this.

8 don't have any empty Tiffany frames. I could go to Tiffany's 9 next door and get one with the account we have with them."
10 Q Can you read your response?

3021 1 I know this one was important and special because it was a 2 photo of what I remember to be his mother, so he wanted a nice 3 frame for that. 4 Q Was it unusual for Mr. Trump to weigh in on expenses 5 of this amount? 6 A I don't recall any other instances like this.

7 Q Do you remember if you passed this question on to 8 Mr. Trump? 9 A I don't.

10 We may have made the executive decision without his 11 approval.

12 THE WITNESS: Sorry, sir. 13 Q Was it your understanding that this is the type of 14 thing Ms. Graff would want Mr. Trump to look at?

15 A I really -- I don't know. I think she may have -- I 16 don't know. I'm sorry.

17 Q Focusing on early 2018, do you remember a story coming 18 out about Mr. Trump and a woman named Stormy Daniels? 19 A Yes.

20 Q Do you remember Mr. Trump's reaction to that story? 21 A I remember he was very upset by it.

22 Q Do you recall if Mr. Trump spoke to Michael Cohen 23 around the time the story came out? 24 A Um, I believe they spoke around that time, yes.

25 Q In your position as Mr. Trump's Executive Assistant,
3022 1 did you interact with Mrs. Trump?

2 A I did, yes. 3 Q Were you familiar with their relationship? 4 A Yes.

5 Q How would you describe their relationship? 6 A I -- I believe they have a relationship of mutual 7 respect. Um, I -- I just found their relationship really, um, 8 special. 9 I know he cares a lot about her opinion. There was really 10 no one else that could kind of put him in his place, too. 11 So, he was my boss, but she was definitely the one in 12 charge. 13 But, I -- I just remember thinking that their relationship 14 was really special.

15 They laughed a lot when she came in to the Oval Office. Um. 16 And he would, you know, once in a while tell me to call her and 17 let her know that he was running late. Just like any other 18 marriage. Like, "Honey, I'm going to be late for dinner." 19 She would call me sometimes and say, "It's past dinnertime.

20 When is my husband coming home?" 21 So, I just really respected their relationship.

22 Q Did anything about their relationship change after the 23 Stormy Daniels story came out? 24 A Not that I saw, no.

25 Q At some point, did you leave the White House job?

3023 1 A I did.

2 Q Can you, very briefly, describe the circumstances 3 surrounding your departure? 4 A Yes.

5 In August of 2019, I was invited by a White House colleague 6 of mine to what I understood to be an off-the-record dinner.

7 And at that dinner I said some things that I should not have 8 said. 9 That mistake, eventually -- ultimately, cost me my job.

10 And I am very regretful of my youthful indiscretion. 11 But I feel like I've learned a lot from that experience. I
12 think I've grown a lot since then. (Crying). Sorry. 13 (The Court gives the witness tissues.)
16 A No.

18 Q Did you end up writing a book about your experience? 19 A I did, yes.

20 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please show the witness, the 21 parties, and the Court, People's Exhibit 392 for 22 identification? 23 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness' 24 and the parties' screens.)
25 Q Do you recognize this?

14 (Witness crying.) 17 I'm okay.

15 Q Do you need a minute?

3024 1 A Yes.

2 That's the cover of my book. 3 Q Is it an exact copy of the cover? 4 A Yes.

5 MS. MANGOLD: The People now offer Exhibit 392 in 6 evidence.

14 House; How I Lost It and What I Learned.

15 Q Why did you write the book?

19 incredible experience that I had had working in the White 20 House. 21 Um, I also felt it was really important to share with the 22 American people the man that I got to know. (Crying). 23 Um, I thought it was really important to share with the 24 American people the man that I got to know.

25 I don't think he's treated fairly, and I wanted to tell 11 evidence and is shown on the screens.)
12 Q What is the full title of your book? 13 A It is called Off the Record; My Dream Job at the White 18 But, I also wanted to document for myself and my family the 17 process what I had just been through.

16 A Um, I wrote the book because I -- I needed time to 9 THE COURT: 392 accepted into evidence.

10 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 392 is received in 8 MS. NECHELES: No objection. 7 THE COURT: Any objection?

3025 1 that story. (Crying).

3 your book? 2 Q Have you spoken to Mr. Trump since the publication of 4 A Since the publication, yes.

5 Q Can you briefly describe that for the jury? 6 A Um, I -- he was at a fundraiser in Orange County, 7 where I lived, last Fall. And I hadn't seen him since I left 8 the White House. And so I called one of his aides. (Crying). 9 Q Did you discuss this case at that time?

10 A No, I did not. 11 I called one of his aides and asked if I could come to the 12 fundraiser to say hello, and they said yes. 13 So, I got to see him then. (Crying). 14 Q Have you spoken to him since that time?

15 A No. 16 MS. MANGOLD: No further questions.

17 THE COURT: Your witness.

18 MS. NECHELES: Do you want to take a short break? 19 THE COURT: No.

20 We stop at 4 o'clock today. 21 (Whereupon, the witness continues crying.)
22 CROSS-EXAMINATION 23 BY MS. NECHELES: 24 Q Ms. Westerhout, you were very young when you were 25 working at the White House; right?

1 A Yes.

2 Q You made a mistake; right?

3 A Yes. 4 Q President Trump forgave you; right? 5 A He did. 6 Q Your book, in fact, was very flattering about him; 20 A Yes. 21 Q In fact, he was not your choice?

22 A No.

23 Q He only became your choice once you got to know him; 24 right? 25 A Yes. That's right.

3026 11 Q You thought he was a great person to work for?

12 A I did, yes. And he was.

13 Q And you thought he was a good President? 14 A Yes. (Crying). 15 Q Are you ready to go on? 16 A Yes.

17 Q So, during the 2016 election, before President Trump 18 actually won the Republican nomination, you were working for 19 the RNC?

9 I didn't have anything negative to say, so why would I
10 write it?

8 A Yeah.

7 right?

3027 1 Q So, once he won the election, you started working to 2 help the transition; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you still didn't know him; right?

5 A Uh-uh, no. 6 Q But, before the transition, there was the Access 7 Hollywood tape that you were asked about on direct examination; 8 right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q And you testified on cross that it rattled the RNC 11 leadership; correct?

12 A That was my -- that's my recollection, yes. 13 Q There were a couple of days of consternation; right? 14 A Yes.

15 Q That happened all the time during the campaign; right? 16 A Yeah.

17 Q There's always some event that causes total 18 consternation for a couple of days; right? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And when President Trump was running for election, 21 there was always some event that everybody said, (claps twice),
22 "That's it, he's not gonna win;" right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And everybody around would be freaking out; right?

25 A Yeah.

3028 1 Q But not President Trump; right?

2 A No. 3 Q He did not freak out about any of this; right? 4 A Not that I was aware of.

5 Q He just kept his mind straightforward and kept running 10 A Can you repeat that? 11 Q He kept working and running to win the Presidency; 12 right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q After the Access Hollywood tape came out, some of the 15 people freaked out, right, in the RNC? 16 A Yes.

17 Q And President Trump did not freak out; right?

18 A No. 19 Q He gave a video statement; am I correct?

20 A Not that I remember, but I trust you. 21 Q Okay.

22 Do you recall him giving a public statement, saying he 23 had -- that this was locker room talk and apologizing for that 24 locker room talk?

25 A Yes, I do.

8 THE COURT: Overruled. 9 You can answer. 7 MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

6 for the election; right?

3029 1 Q And he said, "And I look forward to seeing everybody 2 at the debate"? 3 A Yeah. 4 Q And the Access Hollywood tape uproar blew over in a 5 couple of days; right? 6 A Yeah.

7 Q And after that, President Trump won the election? 8 A He did. 9 Q Now, the transition was an extremely busy time for 10 President Trump; right? 11 A Yes.

12 Q He had to fill hundreds of positions; right? 13 A Yes. 14 Q Those were in his cabinet; correct?

15 A Yes. 16 Q And other high-level positions; right?

18 Q And he had to figure out what those positions were; 19 right?

20 A Yes. 21 Q And he had to find candidates to fill those positions; 22 right? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And then he had to interview all those people; right?

25 A Yes.

17 A Yes.

1 Q And part of your job was to help find those people and 2 pre-vet them; right? 3 A Um, yeah -- yes. At least schedule the interviews. 4 I don't know if I was involved in finding them or vetting 5 them.

8 A Yes. I believe -- I think I did a lot of them. Yes.

13 Q So he could read them and be ready to interview these 14 people; right?

15 A Uh-huh. Yes. 16 Q You were scheduling as much as three interviews a day 17 for President Trump with these high-level people; right?

18 A Yes. 19 Q Those would be lengthy interviews; correct?

20 A Yes. 21 Q The prosecutor just asked you on direct examination 22 whether the press called you "the greeter girl"; right? 23 A Yeah. 24 Q And they did that because you would go downstairs in 25 Trump Tower and escort people up; right?

3030 6 But, scheduling their interviews, yes.

7 Q Were you involved in helping create briefing papers? 9 Q And those were multiple-page documents, lengthy 10 documents that would be given to President Trump or 11 President-Elect at that point?

12 A Yes.

1 A Yes.

2 Trump Tower was in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. It's 3 protected by Secret Service. And these people were coming in 4 for the most important interviews of their lives.

5 So, I took it upon myself to greet them downstairs so they 6 wouldn't get lost.

7 Q Them calling you "the greeter girl" was a little bit 8 belittling your work; right? 9 A Yeah.

10 I tried to not let it get to me. But -- I think people said 11 I was unqualified.

12 Q Because you were doing work that was a lot more 13 important than just greeting people; right? 14 A Yes.

15 Q But, that's how the press treated you at that time; 16 right?

17 A Yes.

18 Q And that's what the prosecutor just asked you about; 19 right?

20 A (No response). 21 Q On direct, she asked you if you were called "the 22 greeter girl"? 23 A Yes. 24 Q This is a very busy and hectic time; right?

25 A Yes.

3031 3032 1 Q President Trump was also transitioning his companies 2 at that point into a Trust; right?

3 A Not to my knowledge. But -- 4 Q So, you were not involved in his business? 5 A No. 6 Q What was going on in his business?

7 A No.

8 Q You were involved in just the political side; right?

10 Q But, you are aware he was also running a substantial 11 business until he became elected President; right?

12 A Yes.

13 Q And you knew he had to put that all to the side and 14 just move to become President; right? 15 A Yes. 16 Q And he only had a month-and-a-half to do that?

17 A Yeah. November, December -- yeah. Two-and-a-half 18 months. 19 Q Two-and-a-half months to do all of that; right? 20 A Uh-huh. 21 Q And you were asked on direct examination --
22 MS. NECHELES: One minute, Judge.

23 Q After the transition, you moved to the White House; 24 correct? 25 A Yes.

9 A Yes.

3033 1 Q And that was the first time you were really working 2 closely with President Trump; right? 3 A Yes. 4 Q What was that like?

5 A Um, it was amazing. Um, I think -- I, um, yeah. I 6 really had not spent any time with him.

10 Especially in an office filled with older men. Um, he never 11 made me feel like I didn't -- I didn't belong there.

12 Um, he was a really good boss. 13 He -- I hope he respected me in my job and -- yeah. 14 I just found him very enjoyable to work for.

15 Q And you were asked some questions on direct 16 examination about the way that President Trump interacted with 17 his family.

18 Do you recall those questions? 19 A Yes.

20 Q And he had a close relationship with his children; 21 right?

22 A Very close, yes. 23 Q And he cared a great deal for them; right? 24 A Definitely.

25 Q And you also said he had a -- you observed him, that 7 But, I don't know if anybody should feel like they deserve 8 to be in the West Wing, but he made me -- he never once made me 9 feel like I didn't deserve that job and I didn't belong there.

3034 1 he had a close and lovely relationship with his wife?

2 A Yes. 3 Q Isn't it true that you would also see them, sort of, 4 personally communicating during the day in some way?

5 A Yes. 6 Um, sometimes I would look down on my phone, and if the red 7 light was on, I knew that he was on the phone, but I hadn't 8 placed the call. So, if he was sitting in the Oval Office, I 9 would kind of look up and look into the Oval Office, and there 10 were times when I could kind of figure out that he was on the 11 phone with Mrs. Trump.

21 (Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky 12 And he would say, you know, "Honey, come over to the 13 window." And there was a window in the residence where you 14 could see from the residence into the Oval Office. And he 15 would say, "Come to the window," and they would kind of wave to 16 each other (waves).

17 When he was, you know, boarding Marine One on the South 18 Lawn, he would call Mrs. Trump and say, "Honey, I'm about to 19 board," which I always found funny. Like, of course she knows 20 his schedule. He just wanted to say hi and check in.

10 A Yes. 11 Q And some days President Trump would work from 6:00 a.m. 12 in the morning? 13 A Yes, uh-huh. 14 Q And sometimes he wouldn't go home until very late at 15 night? 16 A That's right. 17 Q And all day he would be taking calls; right?

18 A Oh, yes, uh-huh. 20 A Yes. 19 Q And meeting with people? 21 Q And you said he was reading documents and reviewing 22 them? 23 A Yes, uh-huh. 24 Q And he was also signing a tremendous amount of 25 documents; right?

2 Q And there was a lot of things that he was doing that 3 you didn't really know the details of; right? 4 A Yes, absolutely. 5 Q And you were asked by the Prosecutor if you were -- if 6 you coordinated with The Trump Organization during that first 7 year by asking questions of The Trump Organization employees; 8 right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q The person that you coordinated with most was Rhona 11 Graff; right? 12 A Yes. 13 Q And this did not have to do with The Trump Organization 14 business; did it? 15 A No. 16 Q It had to do with his personal affairs; right? 17 A Yes, uh-huh.

18 Q For example, you needed his contact list; right? 19 A Yes, uh-huh. 20 Q You didn't know who he would want to get calls from; 21 right? 22 A That's right. 23 Q And you didn't know the phone numbers of people; 24 right? 25 A No.

3037 1 Q And you needed his calendar from before; right?

2 A I don't think I needed his calendar. But, yeah, yeah, 3 a lot of things that you would think, like, as a new Executive 4 Assistant you would get. 5 But there was no transition into the White House so Rhona 6 was very helpful. 7 Q So that first year you spent a lot of time talking with 8 Rhona Graff; right? 9 A Yes.

10 Q But you did not spend time talking with The Trump 11 Organization employees to coordinate business of The Trump 12 Organization; right? 13 A No, uh-uh. 14 Q It was just personal aspects for President Trump; 15 right? 16 A That's correct. 17 MS. NECHELES: Is this a good time to break, your 18 Honor? 19 THE COURT: Yes. 20 Is this a good time. 21 MS.

20 THE COURT: All right. Let's take ten minutes and 21 then we will pick it up with Mr. Blanche.

22 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. 23 (Recess taken.) 24 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, I understand that there 25 are three different issues that you want to take up?

3040 3 THE COURT: All right. 4 MR. BLANCHE: My understanding is that -- well, the 5 People informed me that they no longer intend to call 6 Ms. McDougal. 7 So that will -- we no longer need to discuss that. 8 THE COURT: Okay. Good. 9 MR. BLANCHE: The other two issues -- the first 10 is with respect to the Gag Order as it relates to 11 Ms. Daniels. 12 We ask that President Trump be allowed to respond 13 publicly to what happened in court the past day and a half. 14 And this will tie into the motion that I'm about to 15 make for a mistrial. 16 But the press reporting over the past 24 hours 17 about -- about what -- about the current version of the 18 story that we believe is completely false, and that 19 President Trump has said is completely false since the first 20 time it has been mentioned, is completely different in kind 23 And it is significant because, for example, on the 24 news last night, there was -- and this is just one example, 25 and there are many -- one of the supposed participants in 1 MR. BLANCHE: Well, yes, your Honor. Although the 2 good news is that there is now only two.

21 than the denials and the story that has come forward as far 22 back as 2011, as 20 -- 2018.

3041 1 that evening, the friend of Ms. Daniels who supposedly was 2 returned -- she got a phone call from the room that there 3 was testimony about. 4 THE COURT: Yes. 5 MR. BLANCHE: She was on television last night 21 Ms. Daniels are over. She's no longer a witness. 22 And as it relates to other witnesses in the case, 23 your Honor, we are towards the end of the case, I can be 24 corrected by the People, but I believe that the only 25 significant witness left -- that's the wrong word -- the 6 talking about what happened and also corroborating what 7 Ms. Daniels said. 8 This was on a political show with political 9 commentators then commenting about the seriousness of, 10 again, this new, false allegation; right. 11 So it's not -- this isn't President Trump, again, 12 being able to say this never happened; this isn't true. 13 It's now him having to not be able to respond to 14 this new version of events that now deals very deeply with a 15 very different issue than a sexual event that took place in 16 2006. 17 And so, you know, as we said repeatedly -- and I'm 18 not going to dwell on it -- but, you know, this is about -- 19 he needs an opportunity to respond to the American people. 20 And the reasons for the Gag Order as they relate to 3042 1 only witness that is really the subject of the Gag Order is 2 Mr. Cohen. 3 And so, as far as the Court's concern about this 4 proceeding, it should give way to the testimony of the past 5 couple of days. 6 I mean, he's going to be asked repeatedly over the 7 next week or two about these new accusations of consent and 8 of what happened that night. 9 And as the Gag Order stands now, he's not allowed 10 to say, "I did not do that." 11 So there are voters out there and there are 12 questioners who will ask him questions about it, and he 13 can't say anything. 14 His -- the other side can say things. And they 15 already have. 16 There are numerous news articles about it. Many 17 articles, your Honor, today, just based on yesterday.

18 (Indicating.) 19 I haven't checked the news today. 20 But there is no doubt that there will be a feature 21 of political shows tonight and articles. And it cannot be 22 that he cannot respond to that, your Honor, now that she's 23 off the stand, especially because this isn't just the same 24 story that has been going around for the past several years. 25 It's much different.

3043 1 And so we would ask that he be removed from the Gag 2 Order as it relates to Ms. Daniels and that he be able to 3 respond. 4 THE COURT: All right. Let me hear from the 5 People. 6 MR. CONROY: Thank you, Judge. 7 And it seems as though the other side lives in 8 almost an alternate reality. 9 First of all, there is not another side out there.

10 There is a proceeding here that this Order is designed to 11 protect. 12 And I think it has been somewhat effective thus 13 far. 14 And I think we have to look back as to why it was 15 issued in the first place, to put in context what's going on 16 here. 17 This Order was issued to protect the witnesses, the 19 participating in this proceeding, and the very proceeding 20 itself. 21 This is where facts are brought out. 22 This is where, if somebody wants to respond to 23 something that's said in this room, that can happen in this 24 room. It's not supposed to happen out there. 25 There are people out there saying things about 18 citizens participating as jurors, all the people 3044 11 broke in because there was an exhibit displayed on the 12 screen that had her home address. 13 And you could see the fear in her eyes when that 14 happened.

15 It was luckily not displayed to the public. And 16 that's because of what this defendant is doing. It's what 17 he has done in the past.

18 It's why this Order was issued. The Order was not 19 issued lightly.

1 Ms. Daniels and other witnesses, clearly saying them with 2 the defendant in mind. 3 I'm not in a position to say that it's at his 4 direction or anything close to that.

5 But there are people making the defendant's case 6 for him out in the world.

7 We have been told repeatedly by witnesses, even in 8 the courtroom, even on the stand, we have seen the fear in 9 some of these witnesses.

10 The witness who just testified, a couple of times 20 It was issued after we developed an extensive 21 record relating to the attacks this defendant mounts 22 indiscriminately for anyone that he deems worthy of his 23 venom. 24 He does it selfishly, with no concern about the 25 safety of the people he is attacking.

3045 1 And, unfortunately, we have seen the results.

2 Among the evidence the People submitted, in a room that 3 formed the basis of the two Orders restricting extrajudicial 4 statements, was evidence of the significant safety 5 consequences of the defendant's public attacks. 6 We submitted an affidavit from the head of the 14 I had a conversation with a witness last night, a 15 custodial witness, somebody who is coming in to put in 16 records, who is concerned about safety. 17 And that's not the only witness like that. They 18 are not witnesses who have a huge stake in this, and they 19 are worried about it. 20 The fact that witnesses are brave enough to come in 21 here, under subpoena, tell the truth under oath, shouldn't 22 expose them to this defendant's barrage of threats that will 23 put them and potentially their families in danger. 24 Modifying this Gag Order now, in the middle of 25 trial, would signal to future witnesses that they could be 7 DANY -- the DA's Office Executive Protective Detail about 8 the explosion and threat cases lodged by the NYPD against 9 the DA, his family, members of the Prosecution, their 10 families. 11 Your Honor has seen firsthand, as I talked about 12 the very real consequences for witnesses when they express 13 fear in the courtroom.

1 at risk as well.

7 regarding evidentiary cooperation that publicly relate to 12 stop with the named individual. It is also highly likely to 13 influence other witnesses." 14 Here, we have other witnesses. We have a jury. 15 This is a proceeding that's going on. 16 Some of these Orders have involved proceedings 17 where we weren't even on trial yet. Here we are on trial.

18 This Order is not designed just to protect the 19 witness until they are done on the stand and then they walk 20 out the door and they have no protection. 21 And it's not just designed to protect the 22 proceeding part of the way. 23 I also just wanted to point out, we saw a quote 24 from this defendant an hour and a half ago that sort of 25 addressed that exact point.

2 In affirming the D.C. Court's Gag Order in the D.C. 3 criminal case, the D.C. Circuit relied on exactly this 4 point. 5 That Court held, and I quote here: "Common sense 6 and common human experience teach that hostile messages 8 high profile witnesses have a significant likelihood of 9 deterring, chilling or altering the involvement of other 10 witnesses in the case itself." 11 "The undertow generated by such statements does not 3046 3047 9 risk jeopardizing the integrity of these proceedings.

10 We understand -- well, I will leave it there. 11 Thank you. 12 THE COURT: All right. 13 MR. BLANCHE: I mean, Judge, just briefly. 14 Everything that you just heard is different in kind 15 from our request. 16 We are not talking about all kinds of threats that 17 witnesses may be hearing from others besides President 18 Trump, or a witness' concern for her safety testifying, or 19 his safety testifying in this environment, which is 20 understandable, having nothing to do with President Trump. 21 What we're saying is that in this case, on a 22 narrowly-tailored Gag Order, the Court should constantly be 23 making sure that its terms should remain in effect. 24 And you have Ms. Daniels, who came in here 25 yesterday and today, and was allowed to talk about a 1 He said: "You attack people because other people 2 see you doing it, and it sends a message." 3 That's his words on that screen today. And that's 4 what he's doing here. 5 Modifying the Gag Order now to allow the defendant 6 to attack Ms. Daniels -- and that's what he wants to do. 7 Let's not pretend he wants to engage in high-minded 8 discourse, and to thereby put her at risk would seriously 3048 1 completely different version of events.

3 turn to that in minute. 4 THE COURT: When you are saying a completely 5 different set of events, what specifically are you referring 6 to? 7 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, there are several. 8 THE COURT: Look, just give me the main one. 9 MR. BLANCHE: I will give a handful.

10 So, for example, she testified at Transcript 11 Page 2610 yesterday about the incident, where she said: "At 12 first I was just startled. Like jump scared. I wasn't 13 expecting someone to be there. He's, essentially, minus a 14 lot of clothing. That's when I had this moment where I felt 15 the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically 16 leaving my hands and my feet and almost like if you stand up 17 too fast, and everything kind of spins. That happened too.

18 Then I just thought, oh, my God, what did I misread to get 19 here? Because the intention was pretty clear." 20 Now, what she had previously said and, again -- now 21 I'm getting more to the mistrial motion. But, the only 22 reason why her testimony was admissible, according to the 23 Court's ruling prior to trial, was to President Trump's 24 motive and intent, the coconspirator's motive and intent, 25 and what they knew at the time.

2 And, yes, we discredited her. And I am going to 3049 1 So their motive and intent was based off of, among 2 the articles and what she was saying publicly at the time, 3 which is that: "Ugh, here we go. We started kissing. I 4 hope he doesn't try to pay me." 5 Okay. 6 THE COURT: So I don't understand how that's a 7 different alternate set of facts? 8 MR. BLANCHE: One is about consent and one is not, 9 your Honor.

10 I mean, that's the issue, your Honor. 11 One is about -- 12 THE COURT: Right. So there is some crossover 13 between this and the motion for a mistrial. 14 I'm trying to keep it narrow. I'm trying to deal 15 with just one issue at a time. 16 I know that there will be crossover. 17 So let me address this first issue, and then I will 18 hear you on the second one. 19 MR. BLANCHE: Understood. 20 The other -- another example of something that we 21 heard on the stand today, but is not part of what was 22 previously said about this incident and what happened next, 23 briefly, this is Transcript Page 2611 to 12: "I think I 24 just -- I just think I blacked out. I was not drugged. I 25 never insinuated that I was on drugs. I was not drunk. I
3050 24 So, the portion that I wrote down was where your 25 client is attributed with saying "because other people will 5 You will be able to make your arguments for the 6 motion for a mistrial. 7 I want to stick, again, just to this first issue. 8 I don't see what you are referring to as a new set of 9 facts, as a new theory of the case.

10 Please have a seat. 11 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. 12 THE COURT: Look, in response to your request that 13 I modify the Gag Order so that your client can respond to 14 Ms. Daniels, it's interesting what Mr. Conroy said, because 15 I actually wrote the same thing down when I was reading that 16 portion of the book. 17 My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels, 18 or a witness who has already testified. My concern is with 19 protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole. 20 That means that everybody sees what happens. Witnesses who 21 have not yet testified will see what happens. They will see 22 how witnesses who have testified are going to be treated by 23 your client.

4 interest of time.

1 never said anything of that sort. I just don't remember."
2 And then, very shortly later, Transcript Page 2613 -- 3 THE COURT: I'm going to stop you just in the 3051 1 see you doing it." And that's my concern.

2 Other witnesses, including not only Michael Cohen, 3 but these other witnesses that Mr. Conroy referred to, 5 do. 4 will see your client doing whatever it is that he intends to 6 And I can't take your word for it that, no, no, 7 this is going to be low key, this is not going to be an 8 attack, this is just going to be a response to what was 9 said, because that's just not the track record.

10 The reason why the Gag Order is in place, to begin 11 with, is precisely because of the nature of these attacks. 12 The vitriol, these were very real, very threatening attacks 13 on potential witnesses. 14 So the track record, your client's track record 15 speaks for itself. 16 I can't take your word for it that he will just 17 say, hey, I dispute the facts.

18 Now, I continue to be concerned about the witnesses 19 using the Gag Order as a sword instead of a shield. 20 And I will continue to be mindful of that. 21 And I will continue to keep an eye out for that, 22 but that's not what I see happening here right now. 23 And that's not the argument that I see you making. 24 So, with regard to your application for me to modify the Gag 25 Order to allow your client to respond to Ms. Daniels, that 3052 1 application is denied.

2 I will hear you on the motion for a mistrial. 3 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we started this 4 conversation yesterday. 7 We are also prepared, if it's helpful to the Court, 8 as we go through this, to put something in writing over the 9 weekend that further articulates why we believe that there 10 is simply no way that this case should go forward given the 11 testimony that happened, the past day with Ms. Daniels. 12 It's worth -- we mentioned it yesterday, but it's worth 13 mentioning it, that in your Honor's decision of March 18th 14 on Page 4, when you are explaining why Ms. Daniels testimony 15 is admissible at this trial, you, the Court says: "Daniels 16 not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated 17 the falsification of business records, but is also probative 18 of the defendant's intent." 19 "Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding 20 these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the 21 narrative of events and is necessary background for the 22 jury. 23 We then, thereafter, your Honor, put in a motion 24 for an adjournment based upon, in part, on Ms. Clifford's 25 recent change of story.

5 I made a motion yesterday, and I am making another 6 motion today.

3053 1 And we alerted the Court and the Government that 2 Ms. Daniels was now making additional claims, contradicting 8 recently released and from a few pages of notes from 9 December when the People met with Ms. Daniels and gave us 10 the notes. 11 And then, as the Court knows, before the testimony 12 started, we objected again. 13 And the Court allowed -- indicated it would allow 14 testimony about it, but said that it was fine, but we don't 15 need to know the details of the intercourse; and 16 Ms. Hoffinger said that's correct. 17 And then, what proceeded to happen was a whole host 18 of questions that went way beyond just mere fact that it 19 happened. 20 And it included questions from the transcript at 21 Page 2592 asking about the fact that Ms. Daniels had a 22 difficult time growing up. 23 And, again, that was objected to, and it was 24 sustained; but that's a question that should have never been 25 asked.

3 her previous claims that were made at the time that the NDA 4 was entered into, claiming that the -- that this, you know, 5 again, completely made-up encounter with President Trump may 6 have been non-consensual. 7 And we got that from the documentary that was 3054 3 Again, how that's relevant to why we're here, when 4 you -- especially when you weigh it and compare it to the 5 prejudicial nature of that sort of testimony. 6 It almost defies belief that we're here about a 7 records case and the Government is asking questions about an 8 incident that happened in 2006, which we deny even happened, 9 and a series of questions about rolling up a magazine and 10 spanking him. 11 The Court then warned the Government at the break 12 and said that the degree of detail that we're going into 13 here is unnecessary, we don't need to know the details, what 14 the suite looked like or anything like that, please move 15 along more quickly. 16 And the Government said, Okay. 17 They did not do that, your Honor.

18 Instead, they -- there was extensive testimony -- 19 and, again, this is extremely prejudicial testimony. 20 This is not a case about -- this is not a case 21 about sex. 22 This isn't a case about whether that incident took 23 place or didn't take place. Presumably, the NDA can be 24 entered and was entered. We completely denied it. 25 Ms. Daniels said it happened, the NDA was entered.

1 And she then is questioned about President Trump 2 spanking -- being asked to be spanked during the incident.

3055 1 Whether it happened or not has nothing to do with 2 the charges in this case. 3 And it continued on. At Page 2609 of the 4 transcript, there was a question asked about what the inside 8 isn't a witness that was out of control. This was a 9 question that was answered in response to the Government's 10 question of what the bathroom looked like inside; and she 11 answered the question. 12 A little bit later on, I already read it to the 13 Court in response to the Gag Order, the question was: "What 14 was your reaction to seeing him like that?" 15 Now, before the -- before the witness took the 16 stand, there was direction given by the Court about limiting 17 that.

18 There was additional direction by the Court after 19 the break about moving expeditiously through this. 20 And there is an open-ended question about what your 21 reaction was to seeing him like that. 22 There is a very long answer that, again, is 23 completely different than the story that Mr. Cohen, that AMI 24 knew about, Dylan Howard, Gina Rodriguez, the story that 25 they had been told about in 2016, when they were presumably 5 of the bathroom looked like; right. 6 And you will hear, your Honor, when I'm just 7 highlighting some of the questions that were asked, this 3056 4 asked.

25 Now, again, that is a power description.

14 nervously, tried to make a joke out of it and to step around 15 to leave. Even though I was moving like I was in a 16 funhouse, like slow motion. I thought to myself; great. I 17 put myself in this bad situation. Like, what did I do? How 18 did I misread everything? He stood up between me and the 19 door. Not in a threatening manner. He didn't come at me. 20 He didn't rush at me. He didn't put his hands on me or 21 nothing like that. I said, I got to go. He said, I thought 22 we were getting somewhere. We were talking. I thought you 23 were serious about what you wanted, if you ever want to get 24 out of that trailer park."
1 negotiating and determining what -- whether to pay for this 2 story. That's not the story that they were told. 3 So, it's not relevant, and it shouldn't have been 5 And I already read that. I'm not going to reread 6 it again. 7 And then, it didn't stop there. Page 2610 of the 8 transcript onto Page 2611, there is a long question about 9 what happened when she exited the bathroom.

10 And this is where, again, she said something not 11 anywhere near the story that was told, supposedly, to 12 Mr. Cohen. 13 She says: "I went to step around. I laughed 1 That is an extremely prejudicial statement by a 2 witness that was never said to -- there is no evidence that 3 that was said to AMI. 4 There was no evidence that that was said to 5 Mr. Cohen. There was no evidence that that had anything to 8 On the other hand, it's just extraordinarily 9 prejudicial for a jury to hear.

10 Shortly thereafter, 2611 to '12, the question is: 11 "What happened next, briefly?" Okay. There has already 12 been testimony -- the Court was clear with the Government to 13 not go into more than just the fact that it happened. 14 But, they didn't abide by the Court's rules. 15 "What happened next?" 16 And the witness says, "I think I blacked out. I 17 wasn't drunk. I just don't remember."
18 And then there was the questions that we talked 19 about yesterday, about how -- the size; how tall was he. 20 So, there is a question: "So, he was standing up 21 and you were standing up. What were your relative heights?" 22 How is that relevant to this case? That is so 23 prejudicial, and so incredible for a jury to hear the 24 Government ask a witness talking about what she's now saying 25 is a power move by the person who she's having sex with, 3057 6 do with the motive of anybody involved in this case to enter 7 into that NDA in 2016.

3058 1 okay.

11 threatened and the answer was, "No. Not physically." 12 And then she describes how threatened she felt. 13 "Although I did note there was a bodyguard right outside the 14 door. There was an imbalance of power for sure." 15 I mean, that is -- I mean, you have jurors who are 16 now hearing about an imbalance of power between a man and a 17 woman.

18 And none of that information is information that 19 goes to the motive of anybody in this case, including 20 President Trump, because it's not any information that she 21 was saying at the time, which is the only reason that 22 evidence is coming in, your Honor. 23 And, then, even though your Honor had said that, 24 clearly, that that's fine -- this is the transcript at Page 25 2511, before the witness took the stand: "We don't need to 8 several inches taller and much larger." 9 Okay. Now -- and then there was a question about 10 the -- whether a -- at 2613, about whether she felt 6 But, they knew the answer because there was no surprise when 7 she said, "I'm 5'6"; I don't know how tall he was, but 2 And the DA says: "Well, what were your heights," 3 knowing the answer. 4 Now, we didn't know the answer because we didn't 5 get any notes from their prep except for one from December.

3059 1 know the details of the intercourse."
13 And then the People didn't stop there. 14 They asked whether she remembers how her clothes 15 came off. And the answer was no. 16 And the question -- and, again, presumably the 17 Government knows this is coming -- says, "Is that a memory 18 that has not come back to you?" 19 Again, that is so prejudicial to suggest that there 20 was an event where -- again, I mean, nothing to do with this 21 case and why we're here. 23 but it's the question that should never have been asked. 25 They said: "Do you have a recollection of feeling 2 But the People still asked. 3 And then the People said: "Can you very briefly 4 describe, you know, where you had sex with him?" 5 She describes it. In detail. Right. And I'm not 6 going to read all of the whole answer. 7 But it's 2613 and '14. 8 And, again, I don't know what -- I mean, our 9 understanding of the Court's motion in limine for why this 10 evidence was coming in and then your Honor's instructions, 11 there was no basis for the Government to ask that question, 12 given what the testimony was offered for, your Honor.

24 Thereafter, the Government wouldn't stop. 22 And the answer, that was an objection sustained, 3060 1 something unusual that you have a memory of?"
2 There is no reason for that question, your Honor. 3 That should not have been asked. 4 And, you know, we didn't know these questions were 5 coming. We didn't know. 6 And that's -- you know, we had a sense from her 7 documentary that she was changing her story. 8 And we alerted the Court, and we alerted the 9 Government, but we were sitting here, hearing that for the 10 first time on the witness stand yesterday. 11 And then, finally, at 2615: "What, if anything, 12 did you remember other than the fact that you had sex on the 13 bed?" 14 The answer: "I was staring at the ceiling. I 15 didn't know how I got there. I made note like I was trying 17 there."
18 THE COURT: And there was an objection, and it was 19 sustained. 20 MR. BLANCHE: Excuse me, your Honor? 21 THE COURT: And there was an objection, and it was 22 sustained. 23 MR. BLANCHE: Judge -- 24 THE COURT: In fact. 25 MR. BLANCHE: Judge --
16 to think about anything other than what was happening 3061 22 industry where a condom is mandatory, and so then eliciting 23 that there wasn't a condom -- and, again, that has nothing 1 THE COURT: In fact, after many of these anecdotes, 2 there were objections and they were sustained. 3 MR. BLANCHE: There was an objection and it was 4 sustained. 5 That doesn't excuse the conduct and doesn't excuse 6 the questions being asked. Especially with your Honor's 7 ruling, especially knowing full well that the jury hears the 8 question; hear's the answer; and then objection is 9 sustained.

10 I mean, Judge, that's why this type of evidence is 11 so dangerous and so prejudicial and borders on a problem 12 from the beginning, which is why the Court was very careful 13 in allowing it in for a specific purpose and, further, very 14 careful about telling the Government that they're limited in 15 what they can ask. 16 And then the questions about wearing a condom. 17 Judge, now, in that situation, the significance of that is 18 -- and, again, we didn't know this was coming. 19 But, a few minutes earlier, the questions had been 20 elicited about her job and about how and why she went to 21 work for a particular company, the only company in the 24 to do with the false business records, but is so 25 prejudicial. It's a dog whistle for rape.

3062 1 THE COURT: All right. I mean, let me hear from 2 the People, please. 3 MR. BLANCHE: I have many, many more, but I will 4 stop. 5 THE COURT: I appreciate that, but let me hear from 6 the People. 7 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay. So that was a lot that 8 Mr. Blanche said. 9 Most of it just flat out untrue. Starting with the 10 fact that this is a new account. 11 This is not a new account. 12 This account has been documented in many previous 13 interviews, which the defense has had access to, and used 14 somewhat effectively and somewhat misleadingly on 15 cross-examination. 16 Not the least of which is, at least half the things 17 that Mr. Blanche has said that they didn't know was coming 18 are included in the exhaustive typed interview notes that 19 were taken in a December interview with Ms. Daniels, and 20 shared with counsel promptly after that interview. 21 Those details were elicited in the Anderson Cooper 22 interview. 23 They were elicited in numerous other interviews, 24 all of which the defense has access to. 25 So the claim of ambush is just nonsense.

1 The claim of changing the story is also 2 extraordinarily untrue. 3 There may be, as with any witness recounting a 4 story, details that are said in one forum, but not in the 5 another forum. Things that were, you know, omitted in an 6 interview that was given for entertainment purposes versus 7 an interview that was given for, you know, a more fulsome 8 interview with Anderson Cooper in 2018 versus an interview 9 in preparation for trial testimony, which is more detailed 10 than any of those things, versus a documentary. 11 All of which the defense has had access to.

12 So, our first point here is that this is not a 13 change of story, as they have tried to characterize it. 14 Second of all, to the extent that there were 15 inconsistencies, Ms. Necheles -- certainly, Ms. Necheles 16 certainly probed them in her very narrow, but somewhat 17 misleading cross-examination.

18 You will remember that she, in an attempt -- she 19 attempted to impeach Ms. Daniels with three or four 20 inconsistencies or omissions from the Anderson Cooper 21 interview, which were allowed.

22 We attempted to put in the rest of that interview 23 to show just how similar her testimony was to the account 24 that she gave Anderson Cooper in 2018.

25 And I'm not going to reargue the ruling, I
3063 3064 1 understand the Court's ruling on that.

2 But, the fact of the matter is, is Ms. Necheles led 3 a very misleading impression, as Mr. Blanche is doing now, 4 that her story has somehow become radically different from 5 the way that it always was. 6 So, moving on to the actual mistrial motion. 7 It has always been the People's contention that the 8 details in this case, the details of the two-hour 9 conversation that Ms. Daniels had with the defendant in the 10 living room and the dining room of his hotel room in 11 Harrah's corroborate her account. 12 They corroborate, A, the fact that sex happened, 13 which increases the motivation to silence her. 17 story. 16 story, both before and during the sexual act corroborate her 18 That is the -- those are the kind of details that 19 make her account more credible. 20 Now, the defense has gone through great lengths to 21 try to discredit her, to try to claim that the sex never 22 happened. 25 prerogative. 23 And, incidentally, if they want to offer testimony 24 of the fact that the sex never happened, that's their 15 Well, the point here is that the details of her 14 I will point out a few things.

1 However, they have -- they opened on, and this is 2 Page 96 of the transcript, referring to Stormy Daniels: 3 "She was paid so she would not spread false claims about 4 Mr. Trump." 5 They opened also on Page 905 to 906 of the 22 And Ms. Daniels also testified that when she came 23 out of the bathroom in Mr. Trump's -- the bathroom off of 24 Mr. Trump's bedroom, that he was lying on the bed and the 25 first thing that went through her head was: "How did I
9 salacious."
10 Now, this is all coming from the defense. 11 And so, they are basically trying to have their 12 cake and eat it too. 13 They are trying to discredit Ms. Daniels by 14 claiming in their opening that her story is false and then 15 preclude the People from eliciting the very details that can 16 corroborate that account because they have the ring of 17 truth.

18 Ms. -- Mr. Blanche gives a couple of examples and 19 thinks that these questions were totally out of left field. 20 For example, he raises the question about the spanking 21 incident that Ms. Daniels relayed during her testimony.

6 transcript: "Ms. Clifford has publicly denied any improper 7 relationship in writing." 8 Page 906 of the opening: "Her testimony will be 3065 3066 1 misread this?"
4 meeting?" 5 And you can bet that if we didn't draw the sting 6 and elicit the spanking incident, that Ms. Necheles would 7 have cross-examined her: Oh, really? You spanked him? You 8 didn't think that there was anything sexual about that. 9 So we needed to give her a chance to explain that, 10 to prevent them from undermining her credibility. 11 Similarly, Mr. Blanche complains about eliciting 12 the fact that Mr. Trump did not wear a condom during their 13 sexual encounter. 16 that preceded the sexual encounter, is that Mr. Trump 17 seemed -- asked a lot of questions about the testing in the 18 adult film industry: How often the testing happens, whether 19 performers are required to wear condoms, et cetera, 20 questions about that. 21 And the reason -- the reason that that's relevant 22 is because it explains his decision to not wear a condom. 23 And the fact that testimony about him not wearing a 24 condom comes out is because the description of the 25 conversation that she had with Mr. Trump, again, 2 "How did I misunderstand these clues?" 3 "How did I think this was about a business 14 Now, if you remember the testimony, and part of the 15 reason the testimony was elicited about the conversation 3067 1 corroborates her story.

2 So what seems like a detail that is insignificant 3 and irrelevant to Mr. Blanche is not, as Ms. Necheles' cross 4 made perfectly clear; cherry-picking the details that she 5 thought were inconsistent and omitting the details that have 6 always been consistent. 7 So the overarching point here is that the details 8 are essential to give the jury the tools they need to 9 analyze her credibility.

10 And presenting only a generalized account 11 undermines her reliability as a witness because it affects 12 her ability to perceive and remember these details. 13 And Mr. Blanche complains about the fact that these 14 details are messy. 15 But, the point is -- and Mr. Blanche says, well, 16 she never said any of this to Michael Cohen or AMI in 2016. 17 She didn't speak to Mr. Cohen or AMI in 2016.

18 But you know who knew what happened in that room? 19 Mr. Trump knew. 20 And those details of what happened in that room, 21 those messy details, that is motive. 22 That was Mr. Trump's motive to silence this woman 23 before she could tell her story in 2016, less than a month 24 before the election. 25 So, these are not -- this is not irrelevant.

3068 1 Mr. Trump was aware of those details.

2 And the fact that the testimony is prejudicial and 3 messy, according to Mr. Blanche, that is why Mr. Trump tried 4 so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about 5 this. 6 Notwithstanding all of that, we went out of our way 7 to eliminate the most salacious details in order to avoid 8 embarrassing the defendant, even though some of those 9 details are highly corroborative.

10 And, you know, there was a fair amount of detail 11 elicited about the room outside, the conversation, the 12 two-hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with Mr. Trump. 13 But do you know where there was not a lot of detail 14 elicited? The actual sexual encounter. 15 By my count, there are about eight questions about 16 it. 17 Most of them are yes or no answers.

18 There is no opportunity for long explanations about 19 it. 20 We tried very hard to respond to your Honor's 21 efforts to pull back the testimony and to not have a fulsome 22 description of the actual sexual act. 23 And, you know, despite the fact that the details of 24 that sexual act would corroborate her story, they were not 25 elicited.

3069 1 I will give you an example.

10 corroborate her account of having a sexual interaction with 11 the defendant, but was not elicited. 12 Your Honor sustained the objection. 13 There are other details that I don't want to put on 14 the record. 15 I'm happy to make an ex parte -- or not an ex 21 the significant level of detail that was elicited about the 22 pre-encounter, the conversation, the relatively harmless 23 conversation that happened in the dining room and living 24 room, but not details about the sexual encounter. 25 And that's what -- the adjustment that we made to 2 I believe your Honor sustained the objection here, 3 at one point Ms. Daniels was asked, you know: "Did you feel 4 anything unusual?" 5 Now, the answer to that question was going to be: 6 "I felt what it felt like to feel the skin of a 60-year old 7 man. I was 27 years old. And that was a different -- that 8 was different than anything I had ever felt before." 9 Now, that's the kind of detail that would 17 details that were deliberately omitted, notwithstanding the 18 fact that they are highly corroborative because we did not 19 have the desire to embarrass the defendant. 20 So Mr. Blanche, in his application, is conflating 16 parte, a sealed record about some of the very salacious 3070 12 correcting Mr. Blanche. 13 We had never affirmatively indicated that we were 14 going to call her. She was like many people on our witness 15 list. 16 Anyway, back to what I was saying. 17 This issue was thoroughly briefed. And the Court, 18 mindful of the potential prejudice, limited the details of 19 the Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin story to just the fact 20 of the allegation and not the underlying details, but did 21 not make a similar limitation on the Stormy Daniels story 22 because, as the Court recognized, it was so intertwined with 23 the motive to silence her. 24 I'm just going to read very briefly from your 25 Honor's ruling.

1 be responsive to your Honor's concerns that we not go too 2 far into the details of the sexual encounter. 3 I'm going to say one more thing about this, which 4 is the argument -- this argument was thoroughly briefed by 5 the defense in their endeavor to keep this testimony out, as 6 well as similar testimony about Karen McDougal and Dino 7 Sajudin. 8 And, by the way, about Karen MacDougal, we didn't 9 change our minds about calling her.

10 She was on our witness list, but we had never 11 indicated an actual intention to call her. I am just 3071 1 THE COURT: Which ruling are you referring to?

2 MR. STEINGLASS: I'm referring to your decision on 3 the defendant's motion in limine, which is at Page 3 and 4, 4 I believe, the decision was issued on March 18th or 19th. 5 What your Honor wrote was: "In the instant matter, 6 testimony from or regarding Sajudin, McDougal and Daniels 7 may be introduced." 8 "The probative value of the evidence is evident. 9 For example, the actions of the three individuals allegedly 10 flow directly from the 2015 meeting at Trump Tower where 11 Pecker, Cohen and defendant were present. 12 Their testimony qualifies under several of the 13 Molineux exceptions." 14 I'm skipping a little bit. 15 "Locating and purchasing the information from 16 Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that 17 precipitated the falsification of business records, but is 18 also probative of the defendant's intent." 19 "Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding 20 these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the 21 narrative of events and is necessary background for the 22 jury." 23 Your Honor went on to distinguish between Karen 24 McDougal and Dino Sajudin: 25 "However, when carefully balancing the probative 3072 1 value of testimony against the potential for undue 2 prejudice, the Court believes that the testimony from or 3 about Sajudin and McDougal must come with some limitations. 7 details of, what allegedly transpired between those 8 individuals and the defendant." 9 And we honored that ruling.

10 That limitation did not apply to Stormy Daniels, 11 although the defense asked that it did. 12 I'm only saying this to say that we feel that we 13 have very faithfully adhered to your Honor's rulings and 14 even took additional details out of the questions that we 15 had planned on asking Ms. Daniels as a result of your 16 Honor's -- the conversation that we had at the bench before 17 she began testifying, when the defense renewed their motion.

18 All of this to say, is that the defense has not 19 alleged anything remotely approaching grounds for a 20 mistrial. 21 And their motion should be denied. 22 THE COURT: Thank you. 23 All right. Following the motion -- 24 (Mr. Blanche rises.) 25 THE COURT: What, Mr Blanche?

4 Unless the People provide a satisfactory offering of proof, 5 the testimony by or about Sajudin and McDougal will be 6 limited to the fact of, and may not explore the underlying 3073 1 MR. BLANCHE: Just very briefly.

2 THE COURT: Very briefly. 3 MR. BLANCHE: I mean, Judge, what they are saying 4 is not true. 5 So, for example, the People just told you that 6 Ms. McDougal was not on the witness list -- 7 THE COURT: I'm not going to get bogged down on 8 that. 9 MR. BLANCHE: But, Judge --
10 THE COURT: It's not relevant to this motion. 11 That's why I'm saying, very quickly, whether she 12 was going to be called or not going to be called has nothing 13 to do with this motion for a mistrial. 14 MR. BLANCHE: But it does, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: No, it doesn't. 16 I am making the ruling, and I decide whether it 17 does or it doesn't.

18 I'm telling you, it doesn't. 19 Please have a seat so that I can render my 20 decision. 21 Following your motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, I 22 went back to chambers and I pulled out my decisions on both 23 motions in limine; the omnibus decision. 24 I also looked at the transcript from Tuesday's 25 proceedings. I looked at that yesterday.

3074 1 And I went back to just make sure that everyone had 2 followed my guidelines and that there were no 3 inconsistencies, and to just make sure that no one had 4 violated my rulings. 5 After having done so, after reading, again, both 6 sets of motions, both decisions and the motions in limine, 7 the Omnibus Motion and the transcripts, I came away 8 satisfied that -- let me backup. 9 You will recall in my decisions, both in the 10 motions in limine and the omnibus motions, that while I did 11 decide on many of the issues, there were some that I said we 12 are going to have to see how the evidence comes in. 13 And at every trial, the evidence comes in in a 14 different way and it's very, very difficult to anticipate. 15 So sometimes a Court has to change its rulings. Sometimes 16 there has to be a certain amount of flexibility. 17 Why do I say that now?

18 Because in going back to the very opening 19 statements, and I'm looking at Pages 897, 905, 906. 20 Mr. Blanche, in your opening statement, you deny 21 that there was ever a sexual encounter between Stormy 22 Daniels and the defendant. 23 And, again, I direct you to Page 897. 24 Your denial puts the jury in a position of having 25 to choose who they believe: Donald Trump, who denies there 3075 21 frequently because she believed that my ruling at the bench 22 had prevented her from doing so. 23 That's not correct. 24 In fact, if you look at the transcript, you will 25 see that Ms. Necheles actually objected very early on.

8 The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about 9 the encounter, the more the jury can weigh to determine 10 whether the encounter did occur and, if so, whether they 11 choose to credit Ms. Daniels' story. 12 Now, there is more to say about the details. 13 You will recall that I commented on the details on 14 Tuesday. 15 And I will get to that in a minute. 16 I direct your attention to pages 2508 and 2511 of 17 the transcript, having to do with Ms. Daniels' story, but we 18 continue. 19 Ms. Necheles claimed when you made your motion for 20 a mistrial that she did not object more or earlier or more 1 was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there 2 was. 3 Although the People do not have to prove that a 4 sexual encounter actually did occur, they do have the right 5 to rehabilitate Ms. Daniels' credibility and to corroborate 6 her story, which was immediately attacked on opening 7 statements.

3076 1 Look at Page 2592.

2 So she can't say that she didn't object because of 3 my ruling when, in fact, she did object at 2592. 4 However, there were many times, not once or twice, 5 but many times when Ms. Necheles could have objected, but 6 didn't. 7 And, here, I will direct your attention to Pages 8 2598 and 2610. 9 Now, after the Court sua sponte objects, and that 10 objection had to do with the reference to the trailer park, 11 I felt that wasn't necessary. 12 I felt that there was a certain amount of prejudice 13 to that. 16 And then I struck it from the record. 17 Following the Court's own objection, Ms. Necheles 18 then began to object with some frequency. 20 was sustained. 19 And virtually every single one of her objections 21 And every one of her applications that the answers 22 be stricken from the record were, in fact, stricken from the 23 record. 24 And I direct your attention now to Pages 2612 25 through 2615 for that.

14 There was no objection, so I sua sponte objected. 15 I didn't want that in.

3077 1 Yet, for some unexplained reason, which I still 2 don't understand, there was no objection to certain 10 Ms. Necheles didn't object. 11 She had just made about ten objections, most of 12 which were sustained. 13 Why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of 14 a condom? 15 I don't understand. 16 We continue. 17 Ms. Daniels made clear in her testimony, and I
18 direct you now to Page 2611, that she was not drunk or 19 drugged or in any way coerced. 20 Again, this is Page 2611. 21 And for some reason, I don't know why, you went 22 into it ad nauseam on cross-examination. 23 I had sustained any objections related to that. 24 The witness herself had backed off and said, hey, listen, I 25 don't mean to suggest for a second that this was coerced or 3 testimony, which was later used in the motion for a mistrial 4 on Tuesday, and again used today. 5 For example, the mention of the condom. I agree 6 that shouldn't have come out. 7 I wished those questions hadn't been asked, and I 8 wished those answers hadn't been given. 9 But for the life of me, I don't know why 3078 1 forced in any way.

7 ears. 8 I don't understand the reason for that. 9 With regard to your concerns about this, the 10 numbness in the hands and this feeling that she didn't know 11 what was going on and the room spinning, you will recall 12 that at a bench conference, Ms. Hoffinger asked that the 13 People be permitted to ask a question about a moment that 14 came years later, with what was referred to as a Bombshell 15 moment, and that that would explain a lot of the things that 16 she had not mentioned originally, that she had remembered 17 later on, and some of her emotions that she was feeling, I
18 asked Ms. Hoffinger, what are you referring to? What are 19 you talking about? 20 And she said she was specifically referring to the 21 movie Bombshell. 23 certain allegations of sexual -- of a sexual nature made 24 against him. 25 And, apparently, Ms. Daniels had watched this movie 2 She backtracked immediately when she heard how that 3 might have sounded. 4 And for some reason, today, I don't know how much 5 time Ms. Necheles spent on this, on cross-examination, 6 drilling it over and over and over again into the jury's 22 And which is -- which chronicled Roger Ailes and 3079 1 years later and it was at that point that certain memories 2 came back and certain explanations came back to her for her 3 feelings. 4 I ruled immediately that that could not come in. 5 I felt that to somehow inject Roger Ailes into 6 these proceedings would be unduly prejudicial to your 7 client and I did so even though these feelings of the 8 numbness of hands, the room spinning, the blacking out went 9 unexplained.

22 And the fact that you went after her right on 23 opening statements, attacking whether -- attacking, your 24 claim that they never had sex, you didn't attack that there 25 was a falsification of business records, you didn't attack 10 And I did that to protect your client. 11 I disagree with your narrative that there is any 12 new account here. 13 I disagree that there is any change in story. 14 What's happened is people have gone into more detail than 15 they originally planned. 16 And I do agree that certain details, although I may 17 have originally disagreed on Tuesday, certain details such 18 as the color of the floor tiles, the description of the 19 furniture in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture, 20 these details add a sense of credibility if the jury chooses 21 to believe them.

3080 6 what they can to rehabilitate her and to corroborate her 7 story.

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 8 Your motion for a mistrial is denied. I will see 9 you tomorrow at 9:30.

10 (Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned 11 to Friday, May 10th, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.) 12 **********
1 any of the other elements of the offense, you said my client 2 denies that there was ever a sexual encounter. 3 Again, as I said before, right off the bat, that 4 puts your client's word against Ms. Daniels' word. 5 And that, in my mind, allows the People to do
