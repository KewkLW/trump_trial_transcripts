# Court Case Transcripts Repository

This repository contains transcripts and evidence from court cases pulled from the [NY Courts Press](https://ww2.nycourts.gov/press/index.shtml). The repository is organized into three folders to facilitate different use cases and formats.

## Contents

### 1. PDF

This folder contains the raw transcripts directly from the court in PDF format. These documents are unmodified and can be viewed using any standard PDF reader.

### 2. Mark_down

This folder contains text files parsed from the PDFs for a more readable format. The text files are organized for ease of reading and can be used for quick reference or manual review.

### 3. JSON

This folder contains the transcripts in JSON format. This format is suitable for ease of parsing, generating analytics, or creating graphs. If you are familiar with JSON, you will find this format useful for programmatically accessing and manipulating the transcript data.

## Usage

- **PDF**: Use any PDF reader to view the documents.
- **Mark_down**: Open the text files in any text editor or markdown viewer for a more readable format of the transcripts.
- **JSON**: Utilize the JSON files for programmatic access, data analysis, or visualization.

## Notes

- The JSON format is particularly useful for developers and data analysts who need to extract insights or visualize data from the transcripts.

Feel free to explore the different formats and use the one that best suits your needs.
